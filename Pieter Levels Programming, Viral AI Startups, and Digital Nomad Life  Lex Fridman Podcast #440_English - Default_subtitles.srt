1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
- So I was trying to figure out

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,090
how to do photorealistic
AI photos and it was...

3
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:05,250
Stable Diffusion by itself
is not doing that well.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,112
The faces look all mangled-
- Yeah.

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,539
- And it doesn't have enough resolution

6
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,639
or something to do that well.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,250
But I started seeing these base models,

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,083
these fine tune models,

9
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,410
and people would train them on porn,

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,309
and I would try them,

11
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,349
and they would be very photorealistic.

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,330
They would have bodies
that actually made sense,

13
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,642
like body anatomy.

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,790
But if you look at the
photo realistic models

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,469
that people use now, still,

16
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,299
there's still core of porn there,

17
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,132
of naked people-
- Yeah.

18
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,909
- So I need to prompt out the naked,

19
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,159
and everyone needs to do this
with AI startups with imaging.

20
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,816
You need to prompt out the naked stuff.

21
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,310
- You have to keep reminding the model

22
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,480
you need to put clothes on the thing.

23
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,159
- Yeah, don't put naked
'cause it's very risky.

24
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,269
I have Google Vision-
- Yeah.

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,730
- That checks every photo
before it's shown to the user

26
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,520
to like check for NSWF.
- Like nipples detector?

27
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,173
Oh, NSFW detector. (chuckles)

28
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,402
- Because the journalist gets very angry.

29
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,969
- The following is a conversation

30
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,353
with Pieter Levels, also
known on X as levelsio.

31
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,220
He is a self-taught
developer and entrepreneur

32
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,629
who designed programs shipped
and ran over 40 startups,

33
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,653
many of which are hugely successful.

34
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,959
In most cases, he did it all by himself

35
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,629
while living the digital nomad life

36
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,769
in over 40 countries, in over 150 cities,

37
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,950
Programming on a laptop
while chilling on a couch,

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,263
using Vanilla HTML,
jQuery, PHP, and SQLite

39
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,519
He builds and ships quickly
and improves on the fly,

40
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,129
all in the open, documenting his work,

41
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,259
both his successes and failures

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,320
with a raw honesty of a true indie hacker.

43
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,419
Pieter is an inspiration

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,909
to a huge number of
developers and entrepreneurs

45
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,819
who love creating cool things in the world

46
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,909
that are hopefully useful for people.

47
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,149
This was an honor and a pleasure for me.

48
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,950

51
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:02,852
And now, dear friends,
here's Pieter Levels.

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,810
You've launched a lot of companies

53
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,370
and built a lot of products.

54
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,770
As you say, most failed,
but some succeeded.

55
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,969
What's your philosophy

56
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:14,759
behind building the startups that you did?

57
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,592
- I think my philosophy

58
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,669
is very different than
most people in startups.

59
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:18,780
'Cause most people in startups,

60
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,969
they build a company and
they raise money, right?

61
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,560
And they hire people,

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,180
and then they build a product,

63
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,340
and they find something that makes money.

64
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,330
I don't really raise money.

65
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,380
I don't use VC funding.

66
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:29,490
I do everything myself.

67
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,323
I'm a designer.

68
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:31,170
I'm the developer.

69
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:33,179
I make everything, I make the logo.

70
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,167
So for me, I'm much more scrappy.

71
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,171
And because I don't have funding,

72
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:38,280
I need to go fast.

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
I need to make things fast to
see if an idea works, right?

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,819
I have an idea in my mind and I build it,

75
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,459
build like a micro, mini startup.

76
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,689
And I launch it very quickly,

77
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:51,270
like within two weeks or
something of building it,

78
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,227
and I check if there's demand.

79
00:02:52,227 --> 00:02:53,819
And if people actually sign up,

80
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,719
and not just sign up,

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,460
but if people actually pay money, right?

82
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,980
They need to take out their
credit cards, pay me money,

83
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,250
and then I can see if
the idea is validated.

84
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,680
And most ideas don't
work, like as you say,

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,760
most fail.

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,669
- So there's this rapid iterative phase

87
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,909
where you just build a
prototype that works, launch it.

88
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,049
- Yeah.
- See if people like it,

89
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,060
improving it really, really quickly

90
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,080
to see if people like it

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
a little bit more enough
to pay, and all that.

92
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,347
That whole rapid process
is how you think of.

93
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:23,040
- Yeah, I think it's very rapid,

94
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,079
and it's like if I compare to,

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,030
for example, Google,
like big tech companies.

96
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,400
Especially Google right
now is kind of struggling.

97
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,689
They made transformers.

98
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,877
They invented all the AI stuff years ago,

99
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,980
and they never really shipped.

100
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,719
They could have shipped
ChatGPT, for example,

101
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,552
I think I heard in 2019,

102
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:38,759
and they never shipped it

103
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,039
because they were so stuck in bureaucracy.

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:41,872
But they had everything,
they had the data,

105
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:43,889
they had the tech, they had the engineers,

106
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:44,989
and they didn't do it.

107
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:48,030
And it's because these big organizations,

108
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,590
it can make you very slow.

109
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,979
So being alone by myself on my laptop,

110
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,079
in my underwear in a
hotel room or something,

111
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,100
I can ship very fast,

112
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,346
and I don't need to ask legal for like,

113
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:01,063
"Oh, can you vouch for this?"

114
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:02,459
I can just go and ship.

115
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,200
- Do you always code in your underwear?

116
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,349
Your profile picture, you're slouching-

117
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:08,182
- Yeah.
- On a couch

118
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,989
in your underwear, chilling on a laptop.

119
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,879
- No, but I do wear shorts a lot,

120
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,799
and I usually just wear
shorts and no T-shirt

121
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,090
'cause I'm always too hot.

122
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm always overheating.

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,759
- Thank you for showing up

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,899
not just in your underwear but-

125
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,733
- Yeah.
- Wearing shorts.

126
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,149
- And I'm still wearing this for you,

127
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,259
but-
- Thank you.

128
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:23,490
Thank you for dressing up.

129
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,839
(Pieter chuckles)

130
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,609
- Since I go to the
gym, I'm always too hot.

131
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,230
- What's your favorite
exercise in the gym?

132
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,220
- Man, overhead press.

133
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,630
- Overhead press like shoulder press?

134
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,860
- Yeah.
- Okay.

135
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,170
- But it feels good 'cause you win,

136
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,187
'cause when you-
(Lex laughs)

137
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,744
I do 60 kilos.
- Yeah.

138
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,760
- So it's like 120 pounds or something.

139
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,069
It's my only thing I
can do well in the gym.

140
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:43,529
And you stand like this and
you're like, "I did it,"

141
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,362
like a winner pose.
- It's victory thing.

142
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,139
Yeah.
- The victory pose.

143
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,949
I do bench press, squat, deadlifts.

144
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,020
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

145
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:50,819
- Hence the mug.
- Yes.

146
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,110
- Talking to my therapist.
- Yeah.

147
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,430
- It's a deadlift.
- Yeah.

148
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,750
Because it acts like therapy for me.

149
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,266
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah, it is.

150
00:04:56,266 --> 00:04:57,210
- Which is controversial to say.

151
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,949
If I say this on Twitter,
people get angry,

152
00:04:58,949 --> 00:04:59,947
- Physical hardship is a kind of therapy.

153
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:03,007
- Yeah.
- I just rewatched

154
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:05,160
"Happy People" A Year In The Taiga,"

155
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,110
that Werner Herzog film,

156
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,680
where they document people
that are doing trapping.

157
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,959
They're essentially just
working for survival

158
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,359
in the wilderness year round.
- Yeah.

159
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,650
- And there's a deep happiness
to their way of life-

160
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,936
- Yeah.
- Because they're so busy

161
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,949
in it, in nature.
- Yeah, 100%.

162
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:24,420
- There's something about that physical-

163
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,830
- Physical, yeah.
- Toil.

164
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:27,329
- Yeah, my dad taught me that.

165
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,819
My dad always did
construction in the house.

166
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,439
He's always renovating the house.

167
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,730
He breaks through one room

168
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,140
and then he goes to the next room,

169
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,909
and he is just going in
a circle around the house

170
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,233
for the last 40 years.

171
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,283
So he is always doing
construction in the house

172
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:41,153
and it's his hobby.

173
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:44,446
He taught me, when I'm
depressed or something,

174
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,670
he says, "Get a big," what do you call it?

175
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,977
Like a big mountain of sand or
something from construction,

176
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,810
and just get a shovel

177
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,180
and bring it to the other side

178
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,600
and just do physical labor, do hard work,

179
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,220
and do something.

180
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,090
Set a goal, do something.

181
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,879
And I kind of did that with startups too.

182
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,370
- Yeah, construction is not
about the destination, man.

183
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,410
It's about the journey.
- Yeah. (chuckles)

184
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,243
- Sometimes I wonder people

185
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,930
who are always remodeling their house.

186
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,430
Is it really about the remodeling or-

187
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,389
- [Pieter] No, no, its not.

188
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:13,860
- Is it about the project?
- It's the journey.

189
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,693
- The puzzle of it.

190
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:16,139
- No, he doesn't care about the results.

191
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,007
Well, he shows me, he's
like, "It's amazing."

192
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,345
I'm like, "Yeah, it's amazing."

193
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,960
But then he wants to go to the next room.

194
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,049
But I think it's very
metaphorical for work,

195
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,520
'cause I also, I never stop work.

196
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,109
I go to the next website,

197
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,223
or I make a new one, right?

198
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,056
or I make a new startup.

199
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,657
So I'm always like...

200
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,629
To give you something to
wake up in the morning,

201
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,350
and like, have coffee and then

202
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:37,403
kiss your girlfriend,

203
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,090
and then you have like a goal.

204
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:40,259
Today I'm gonna fix this .

205
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,000
Today I'm gonna fix this bug or something.

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,259
I'm gonna do something.

207
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:44,735
You have something to wake up to.

208
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,652
And I think

209
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,900
maybe especially as a man, also women,

210
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,849
but you need a hard work.

211
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,439
You need like an endeavor, I think.

212
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,769
- How much of the building
that you do is about money?

213
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,279
How much is it about just
a deep internal happiness?

214
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,629
- It's really about fun,

215
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,430
'cause I was doing it when
I didn't make money, right?

216
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,263
That's the point.

217
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:05,099
So I was always coding,
I was making music.

218
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,780
I made electronic music,

219
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:08,969
drum bass music 20 years ago,

220
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,010
and I was always making stuff.

221
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,039
So I think creative expression is like

222
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,629
a meaningful work that's so important.

223
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:16,680
It's so fun.

224
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,360
It's so fun to have like a daily challenge

225
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,097
where you try figure stuff out.

226
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,666
- But the interesting thing is

227
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,359
you built a lot of successful products

228
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,050
and you never really wanted
to take it to that level

229
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,030
where you scale real big-
- Yeah.

230
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,069
- And sell it to a company
or something like this.

231
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,319
- Yeah, the problem is I
don't dictate that, right?

232
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,495
If more people start using it,

233
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:36,677
if millions of people
suddenly start using it

234
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,163
and it becomes big,

235
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,433
I'm not gonna say,

236
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,540
"Oh, stop signing up to my
website and pay me money."

237
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,280
But I never raised funding for it.

238
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,139
And I think, 'cause I don't like

239
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,832
the stressful life that comes with it.

240
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,180
I have a lot of founder friends

241
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,949
and they tell me secretly.

242
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,430
With hundreds of millions of
dollars in funding and stuff,

243
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,709
they tell me, "Next
time, if I'm gonna do it,

244
00:07:58,709 --> 00:07:59,969
I'm gonna do it like you

245
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,950
because it's more fun, it's more indie,

246
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,800
it's more chill, it's more creative."

247
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:06,435
They don't like to be manager, right?

248
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,572
You become like a CEO,
you become a manager.

249
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,600
And I think a lot of
people that start startups,

250
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,470
when they become a CEO,

251
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,670
they don't like that job actually,

252
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,770
but they can't really exit it.

253
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,799
But they like to do the
groundwork, the coding.

254
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,139
So I think that keeps you happy,

255
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,000
doing something creative.

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,180
- Yeah, it's interesting how
people are pulled towards that,

257
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,699
to scale to go really big,

258
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,299
and you don't have that honest
reflection with yourself,

259
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,039
like what actually makes you happy?

260
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,539
'Cause for a lot of great engineers,

261
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,669
what makes them happy is the building,

262
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,919
the quote, unquote,
"individual contributor."

263
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,419
- Yeah.
- like where you're actually

264
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,409
still coding or you're-
- Yeah.

265
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,879
- Actually still building.

266
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,500
And they let go of that,

267
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,720
and then they become unhappy,

268
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,269
but some of that is the sacrifice needed

269
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,980
to have a impact at scale

270
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,350
if you truly believe in
a thing you're doing.

271
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,279
- But look at Elon.

272
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,220
He's doing things million
times bigger than me,

273
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,980
and would I wanna do that?

274
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,570
I don't know, you can't really
choose these things, right?

275
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,215
But I really respect that.

276
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,780
I think Elon's very
different from VC founders.

277
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,730
VC, it's like software.

278
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,923
There's a lot of bullshit
in this world, I think.

279
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:12,120
There's a lot of there's dodgy,

280
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,500
finance stuff happening there, I think.

281
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,649
And I never have concrete
evidence about it,

282
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,360
but your gut tells you
something's going on

283
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,789
with companies getting sold to-

284
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:21,956
- Yeah.
- Friends and VCs,

285
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:23,519
and then they do reciprocity

286
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,340
and this shady financial dealings.

287
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,173
With Elon, that's not.

288
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,440
He's just raising money from investors

289
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,430
and he's actually building stuff.

290
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:30,750
He needs the money to build stuff,

291
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,773
hard hardware stuff,

292
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,029
and that I really respect.

293
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,149
- You said that there's been

294
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,709
a few low points in your life.

295
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,639
You've been depressed,

296
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,789
and building is one of the
ways you get out of that.

297
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,719
Can you talk to that?

298
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
Can you take me to that place,

299
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,039
that time when you were at a low point?

300
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,959
- So I was in Holland and
I graduated university,

301
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,269
and I didn't wanna get a normal job,

302
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:52,679
and I was making some money with YouTube

303
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,759
'cause I had this music career

304
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,870
and I uploaded my music to YouTube.

305
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,894
And YouTube started
paying me with AdSense,

306
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,179
like $2,000 a month, $3,000 a month.

307
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,879
And all my friends got normal jobs,

308
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,712
and we stopped hanging out,

309
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,879
'cause people would, like
in university, hang out,

310
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,309
chill at each other's houses,

311
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,689
you go party.

312
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,830
But when people get jobs,

313
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,120
they only party in the weekend,

314
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,606
and they don't hang anymore in the week

315
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:15,059
'cause you need to be at the office.

316
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,019
And I was like, "This is not for me.

317
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,579
I wanna do something else."

318
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,009
And I was starting getting this like,

319
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,710
I think it's like Saturn
return when you turn 27.

320
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,840
It's like some concept
where Saturn returns

321
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,090
to the same place in the orbit that it was

322
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,253
when you're born.
- I'm learning so many things.

323
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,960
- [Pieter] It's some astrology thing.

324
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,530
- So many truly special
artists died when they were 27.

325
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,179
- [Pieter] Exactly, there's
something with 27, man.

326
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:37,012
And it was for me.

327
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,639
I started going crazy-
- Yeah.

328
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,309
- Because I didn't really
see my future in Holland,

329
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,879
buying a house, going living
in the suburbs, and stuff.

330
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,750
So I flew out, I went to Asia,

331
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,919
started digital nomading,

332
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,909
and did that for a year.

333
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,039
And then that made me feel even worse,

334
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,370
'cause I was like alone in hotel rooms,

335
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,899
looking at the ceiling.

336
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,350
What am I doing with my life?

337
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,339
I was working on startups
and stuff on YouTube,

338
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,593
but what is the future here?

339
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,149
While my friends in Holland
were doing really well

340
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,653
and living normal life.

341
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,559
So I was getting very depressed

342
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,629
and I'm like an outcast.

343
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:13,830
My money was shrinking.

344
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,009
I wasn't making money anymore a lot.

345
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,840
I was making $500 a month or something,

346
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,527
And I was looking at the
ceiling thinking like,

347
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,680
"Now I'm 27, I'm a loser."

348
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,409
And that's the moment when
I started building startups.

349
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,496
And it was because my dad said,

350
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:27,329
"If you're depressed,

351
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,430
you need to get sand, get shovel,

352
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,839
start shoveling, doing something.

353
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,700
You can't just sit still."

354
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,290
Which is kinda like a interesting way

355
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:35,429
to deal with depression.

356
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,602
It's not like, "Oh, let's talk about it."

357
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:39,479
It's more like, "Let's go do something."

358
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,269
And I started doing a project called

359
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,829
12 Startups in 12 Months

360
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,410
where every month I would make
something, like a project,

361
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,230
and I would launch it with Stripe,

362
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,350
so people could pay for it.

363
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,290
- So the basic format
is try to build a thing,

364
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:53,699
put it online, and put Stripe

365
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,350
to where you can pay money for it.

366
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,182
- Yeah, add a Stripe...

367
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,269
I'm not sponsored by Stripe,

368
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,590
but add a Stripe checkout button.

369
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,480
- Is that still the easiest way

370
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,340
to just like pay for stuff, Stripe?

371
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,407
- 100%, I think so, yeah.

372
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:04,620
- It's a cool company.

373
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,610
They just made it so easy.

374
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,346
You can just click and-
- Yeah.

375
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,340
And they're really nice.

376
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,899
The CEO, Patrick, is really nice.

377
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,579
- Behind the scenes, it must be difficult

378
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,110
to actually make that happen

379
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,120
because that used to be a huge problem.

380
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,139
- [Pieter] Merchant.

381
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,240
- Just adding a thing, a button

382
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,930
where you can pay for a thing.

383
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:20,879
- Dude.
- It's-

384
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,830
- Dude, I know this because when I was-

385
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,629
- Trustworthy.
- Nine years old,

386
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:26,490
I was making websites also,

387
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,763
and I tried to open a merchant account.

388
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:31,560
There was like before
Stripe you would have like,

389
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,000
I think it was called Worldpay.

390
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,460
So I had to fill out all these forms,

391
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,620
and then I had to fax them to America

392
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,393
from Holland with my dad's fax.

393
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,509
It was on my dad's name,

394
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:43,342
and he had to sign for this,

395
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:44,610
and he started reading
these terms and conditions,

396
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,060
which is he's liable for
100 million in damages.

397
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,196
And he's like, "I don't wanna sign this."

398
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:51,269
I'm like, "Dad, come on,
I need a merchant account.

399
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,509
I need to make money on the internet."

400
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,819
- Yeah. (chuckles)
- And he signed it,

401
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,110
and we faxed it to America,

402
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,310
and I had a merchant accounts,

403
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,019
but then nobody paid for anything,

404
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,579
so that was the problem,

405
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,480
But it's much easier now.

406
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,480
You can sign up, you add
some codes, and yeah.

407
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,670
- So 12 startups in 12 months.

408
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,502
- [Pieter] Yeah.

409
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:10,293
- Startup number one, what was that?

410
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:11,962
What were you feeling?

411
00:13:11,962 --> 00:13:14,060
Were you sitting behind the computer,

412
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,690
how much do you actually know

413
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,090
about building stuff at that point?

414
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,560
- Well, I could code a little bit

415
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,609
'cause I did the YouTube channel

416
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,620
and I made a website for...

417
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,509
I would make websites
for the YouTube channel.

418
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,039
It was called "Panda Mix Show."

419
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,659
And it was like these
electronic music mixes,

420
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,789
like dubstep, or drum
bass, or techno house.

421
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:31,409
- [Lex] I saw one of them had Flash.

422
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,699
Were you using Flash?

423
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,740
- Yeah, my album, my CD
album was using Flash.

424
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,572
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

425
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:36,405
- I sold my CD, yeah.

426
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:38,309
- Kids, Flash was a-
- Flash was cool.

427
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:39,142
- Software.

428
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:41,160
This is the break that-
- Yeah, like grandpa,

429
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,269
but Flash was cool.

430
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:43,110
- Yeah, and there was...

431
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,250
What it is called?

432
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,870
Boy, I should remember this ActionScript.

433
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,047
There's some kind of programming language

434
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:47,901
- Script, yeah, yeah, ActionScript.

435
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,259
- Oh, yeah.
- It was in Flash.

436
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,726
Back then that was the JavaScript.

437
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,959
- The JavaScript, yeah.
- Yeah.

438
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,310
And I thought that's gonna,

439
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,899
that's supposed to be the dynamic thing

440
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,159
that takes over the internet.
- Yeah.

441
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,386
- I invested so many
hours in learning that.

442
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,459
- And Steve Jobs killed it.
- Steve Jobs.

443
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,302
- Steve Jobs said, "Flash
Sucks, stopped using it."

444
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:02,940
Everyone is like, "Okay."

445
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,140
- That guy was right though, right?

446
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,490
- Yeah, I don't know, yeah.

447
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,682
Well, it was a closed
platform I think and-

448
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,509
- Closed.
- But this is ironic

449
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:11,279
'cause Apple, they're not very open.

450
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,600
- Right.
- But back then Steve want

451
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,769
was like, this is closed.

452
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,602
We should not use it.

453
00:14:14,602 --> 00:14:16,409
And it's a security problems I think,

454
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,819
which sounded like a cop out.

455
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,800
I just wanted to say that

456
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,627
to make it look kind of bad.

457
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,470
But Flash was cool, yeah.

458
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,879
- Yeah, it was cool for a time.

459
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,259
- Yeah.
- Listen,

460
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,860
animated GIFs were cool for a time too.

461
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,293
- Yeah.
- They came back

462
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:29,125
in a different way.

463
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,086
- Yeah.
- As a meme though.

464
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,850
I mean like, I even remember when GIFs

465
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,000
were actually cool, not ironically cool.

466
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,919
- Yeah.
- There's like,

467
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,329
on the internet you would have like

468
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,889
a dancing rabbit or something like this.

469
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:41,870
- [Pieter] Yeah.

470
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,720
- And that was really exciting.

471
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,240
- No, you had like the Lex homepage.

472
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,740
Everything was centered.
- Yeah.

473
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,299
- And you had like Pieter's homepage

474
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:50,250
and on the construction.

475
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,389
- Yeah.
- GIF which was like

476
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,271
a guy with a helmet and the lights.

477
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:56,190
It was amazing.
- And there banners.

478
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,530
Yeah, that's before like Google AdSense,

479
00:14:58,529 --> 00:14:59,656
you would've like banners for advertising.

480
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,997
- It was amazing, yeah.

481
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:04,019
- And a lot of links to porn I think.

482
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:04,997
- Yeah.
- Or porny type things.

483
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:05,831
- I think that devil's squared,

484
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,560
and merchant accounts
people would use for,

485
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,519
people would make money a lot.

486
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,495
Only money made on internet
was like porn or a lot of it.

487
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,009
- Yeah, it was a dark place.

488
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:15,750
It's still a dark place.
- Yeah.

489
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,340
- But there's beauty in the darkness.

490
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,910
Anyway, so you did some basic HTML.

491
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:23,279
- Yeah, yeah, but I had to
learn the actual like coding.

492
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,959
So this was good.

493
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,360
It was a good idea to like launch startup,

494
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,235
so I could learn the
codes, learn basic stuff.

495
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:32,279
But it was still very scrappy

496
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,779
'cause I didn't have time to,

497
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:34,612
which is on purpose.

498
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:35,640
I didn't have time to spend a lot of,

499
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,230
I had a month to do something,

500
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,340
so I couldn't spend more than a month.

501
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,410
And I was pretty strict about that.

502
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,789
And I published it as a blog post.

503
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,829
So people, I think I put it on Hacker News

504
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,600
and people would check kinda like, oh,

505
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,560
did you actually, you know.

506
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,819
I felt like accountability,

507
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,990
'cause I put it public,

508
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,129
that I actually had to do it.

509
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,200
- Do you remember the first one you did?

510
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,120
- I think it was Play My Inbox,

511
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,320
'cause back then my friends,

512
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,930
we would send like cool...

513
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,750
It was before Spotify, I
think, we would send like...

514
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,340
2013, we would send music to each other,

515
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,333
like YouTube links.

516
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,820
This is a cool song, this is a cool song.

517
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,730
And it was these giant
email threads on Gmail.

518
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,289
And they were like unnavigable.

519
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,779
So I made an app that
would log into your Gmail,

520
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,651
get them emails and find
ones of YouTube links

521
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:19,020
and then make kinda like
a gallery of your songs.

522
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,234
Essentially Spotify,

523
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:21,617
and my friends loved it.

524
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,129
- Was it scraping it?

525
00:16:23,129 --> 00:16:24,437
Like what was API?

526
00:16:24,437 --> 00:16:26,365
- No, it uses like a POP like POP or IMAP,

527
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,110
Actually check your email,

528
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,430
so that like privacy concerns,

529
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,620
'cause it would get all your
emails to find YouTube links.

530
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,320
But then I wouldn't save anything.

531
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,033
But that was fun.

532
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:39,810
And that first product
already would get pressed,

533
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,869
when think like some tech media and stuff.

534
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,850
And I was like, that's cool.

535
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,700
It didn't make money,

536
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,930
there was no payment button,

537
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,859
but actually people using it.

538
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,226
I think tens of thousands
of people used it.

539
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,529
- That's a great idea.

540
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:55,139
I wonder why, why don't we have that?

541
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,199
Why don't we have things that access Gmail

542
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,205
and extract some useful
aggregate information.

543
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:03,150
- Yeah, yeah, you could tell Gmail,

544
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,200
don't give me all the emails,

545
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,277
just give me the ones with YouTube links-

546
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,568
- Yeah.
- Or something like that.

547
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,609
- Yeah, I mean there is a whole ecosystem

548
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,679
of apps you can build
on top of the Google.

549
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,299
- Yeah.
- But people don't really-

550
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,133
- [Pieter] Never do
this, I've ever see them.

551
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,039
- They build...

552
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,589
I've seen a few, like Boomerang,

553
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,779
there's a few apps that are like good,

554
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:19,613
but just-
- Yeah.

555
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:20,446
- I wonder what...

556
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:22,049
Maybe it's not easy to make money.

557
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,430
- I think it's hard to get people to pay

558
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,019
for these like extensions
and plugins, you know.

559
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,490
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it's not a real app,

560
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,380
so it's not like people don't value it.

561
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,337
People value, oh this...

562
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:30,869
And a plugin should be free.

563
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:31,919
When I want to use a plugin

564
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,850
in Google Sheets or something,

565
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:33,799
I'm not gonna pay for it.

566
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,893
It should be free.

567
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,170
But if you go to a website

568
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,820
and you actually, okay,
I need this product,

569
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:40,417
I'm gonna pay for this
'cause it's a real product.

570
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,689
So even though it's the
same code in the back.

571
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,523
It's a plugin.

572
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,799
- Yeah, I mean you could
do it through extensions,

573
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,349
like Chrome extensions
through from the browser.

574
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,699
- Yeah, but who pays for
Chrome extensions, right?

575
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,960
- Nobody.
- Barely anybody.

576
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,793
- [Lex] Nobody.

577
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,544
- That's not a good place
to make money, probably.

578
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,489
- Yeah, that sucks.

579
00:17:55,489 --> 00:17:57,870
- Chrome extension should be
a extension for your startup.

580
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,309
You know, you have a product.
- Yeah.

581
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,919
- Oh, we also have a Chrome extension.

582
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,190
- I wish the Chrome extension
would be the product.

583
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,585
I wish Chrome would support that.

584
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,418
- [Pieter] Yeah.

585
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,489
- Where you could pay for it easily.

586
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,370
Because imagine, I can
imagine a lot of products

587
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:13,229
that would just live as extensions,

588
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,658
like improvements for social media.

589
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,183
- Yeah.
- A thing that-

590
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,721
- It's GPTs.
- GPTs, yeah.

591
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,735
- Like these ChatGPTs,

592
00:18:18,736 --> 00:18:19,617
they're gonna charge money for now.

593
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:22,680
And you get a rev share,
I think from OpenAI.

594
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,000
I made a lot of them also.

595
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,833
- Why?

596
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,666
We'll talk about it.
- Yeah.

597
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:26,669
- So let's rewind back.
(Pieter laughs)

598
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,836
It's a pretty cool idea to
do 12 startups in 12 months.

599
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:34,049
What's it take to build
a thing in 30 days?

600
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,702
At that time, how hard was that?

601
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,000
- I think the hard part is figuring out

602
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,960
what you shouldn't add, right?

603
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,970
Which you shouldn't build
because you don't have time.

604
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,163
So you need to build a landing page.

605
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,899
Well, you need to make the...
(Lex laughs)

606
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,497
You need to build the product actually,

607
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:50,190
'cause it need to be
something they pay for.

608
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,720
Do you need to build a login system?

609
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,790
Maybe no, maybe you can build
some scrappy login system.

610
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,250
For Photo AI, you sign up,

611
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,269
you pay, Stripe checkout,

612
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,069
and you get a login link.

613
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,038
And when I started out,

614
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,019
there was only a login link with a hash

615
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,430
and that's just a static link.

616
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,600
So it's very easy to log in.

617
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,069
- Yeah.
- It's not so safe.

618
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:05,903
What if you link the link

619
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,950
and now I have real Google login,

620
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,783
but that took like a year.

621
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:12,539
So keeping it very scrappy
is very important too,

622
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,373
because you don't have time.

623
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:17,190
You need to focus on
what you can build fast.

624
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,826
So money, Stripe,

625
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,279
build a product,

626
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:21,329
build a landing page.

627
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,629
You need to think about how
are people gonna find this?

628
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,790
So are you gonna put it
on Reddit or something?

629
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:27,809
How are you gonna put it on Reddit

630
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,009
without being looked
at as a spammer, right?

631
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,219
If you say, "Hey, this is my new startup,

632
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,053
you should use it."

633
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,413
No, nobody gets deleted.

634
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:36,779
Maybe if you find a problem

635
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,279
that a lot of people
on Reddit already have

636
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,116
and sub-Reddit,

637
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:41,317
and you solve that problem and say,

638
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:42,630
"Sub-people, I made this thing

639
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,950
that might solve your problem

640
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,687
and maybe it's free for now."

641
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,149
That could work.

642
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,960
But you need to be very

643
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,490
narrow it down, what you're building.

644
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,079
- Time is limited.
- Yeah.

645
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:57,119
- Actually, can we go back to the,

646
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,089
you laying in a room feeling like a loser?

647
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:00,923
- [Pieter] Yeah.

648
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,329
- I still feel like a loser sometimes

649
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,990
Can you speak to that feeling,

650
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,019
to that place of just like,

651
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,059
feeling like a loser?

652
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,460
Because I think a lot
of people in this world

653
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,201
are laying in a room right
now listening to this.

654
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,690
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- And feeling like a loser.

655
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,039
- Okay, so I think it's
normal if you're young

656
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:21,599
that you feel like a loser, first of all.

657
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,329
- Especially, when you're 27.
- Yes.

658
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,455
Yeah, especially.
- There's like a peak.

659
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,129
- Yeah, yeah, I think 20 is the peak.

660
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,190
And so I would not kill yourselves.

661
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,023
It's very important.

662
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,442
Just get through it.

663
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,100
Because you have nothing,
probably no money,

664
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,199
you have no business, you have no job yet.

665
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,980
Jordan Peterson said
this, I saw it somewhere,

666
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,180
people are depressed
because they have nothing.

667
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,013
They don't have a girlfriend.

668
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:43,846
They don't have a boyfriend.

669
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:44,700
They don't have a...

670
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,529
You need stuff, you
need like, or a family.

671
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,366
You need things around you.

672
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:48,860
You need to build a life for yourself.

673
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,090
If you don't build a life for
yourself, you'll be depressed.

674
00:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,639
So if you're alone in Asia in a hostel

675
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,720
looking at the ceiling,

676
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,370
and you don't have any money coming in,

677
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,329
you don't have a girlfriend,

678
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,859
you don't, of course, you're depressed.

679
00:20:58,859 --> 00:20:59,692
It's logic.

680
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:00,690
But back then, if you're in a moment,

681
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,620
you think there's not logic,

682
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,563
there's something wrong with me.

683
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,140
- [Lex] Yeah.

684
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,740
- And also I think I started
getting like anxiety,

685
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,509
and I think I started
going a little bit crazy

686
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,539
where I think travel can make you sane.

687
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,759
And I know this because
I know that there's like

688
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,039
digital nomads that they kill themselves.

689
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,750
I haven't checked the comparison

690
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,059
with baseline people, like suicide rate.

691
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,829
But I have a hunch,

692
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:24,089
especially in the beginning

693
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:26,639
when it was a very new
thing like 10 years ago,

694
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,820
that it can be very
psychologically taxing.

695
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:32,460
And you're alone a lot,

696
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,930
back then when you travel alone,

697
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,880
there was no other digital
nomads back then, a lot.

698
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,100
So you're in a strange culture.

699
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,809
You look different in everybody.

700
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:40,889
I was in Asia,

701
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,180
everybody's really nice in Thailand,

702
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,430
but you're not part of the culture.

703
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,870
You're traveling around,

704
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:48,149
you're hopping from city to city.

705
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,340
You don't have a home anymore.

706
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:51,779
You feel disrooted.

707
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,789
- And you're constantly in the outcast

708
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,548
and that you're different
from everybody else.

709
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,240
- Yes, exactly.

710
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,094
Like Thailand, people are so nice.

711
00:21:58,094 --> 00:21:58,927
- [Lex] Yes.

712
00:21:58,926 --> 00:21:59,759
- But you still feel like outcast.

713
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,549
And then I think the
digital nomads I met then

714
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:03,615
were all kinda like,

715
00:22:03,615 --> 00:22:04,799
it was like shady business.

716
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,819
But they were like vigilantes

717
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:06,720
'cause it was a new thing.

718
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,150
And one guy was selling illegal drugs.

719
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,983
It was an American guy.

720
00:22:09,982 --> 00:22:10,816
It was selling illegal drugs

721
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:13,380
via UPS to Americans on this website.

722
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,930
There were a lot of
dropshippers doing shady stuff.

723
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,960
There's a lot of shady
things going on there.

724
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
And they didn't look like
very balanced people.

725
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,550
They didn't look like people
I wanted to hang with.

726
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,859
So I also felt outcast
from other foreigners

727
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,929
in Thailand, other digital nomads.

728
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,519
And I was like, "Man,
I made a big mistake."

729
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:30,809
And then I went back to Holland

730
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,279
and then I got even more depressed.

731
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,450
- You said digital nomad.

732
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,529
What is digital nomad?

733
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:35,849
What is that way of life?

734
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:37,589
What is the philosophy there?

735
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,730
And the history of the movement.

736
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,650
- I struck upon it on accident.

737
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,300
'Cause I was like, I'm
gonna graduate university

738
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,950
and then I need to get out of here.

739
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,789
I'll fly to Asia,

740
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:45,623
'cause I've been before in Asia.

741
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,640
I studied in Korea in 2009.

742
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,473
Study exchange.

743
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:49,710
I was like, Asia is easy.

744
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,832
Thailand is easy.

745
00:22:50,832 --> 00:22:52,050
And I'll just go there, figure things out.

746
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:52,883
And it's cheap.

747
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:53,716
It's very cheap.

748
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,427
Chiang Mai, I would live
like for $150 per month rent.

749
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:56,820
- Yeah.
- For like a private room.

750
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:57,653
Pretty good.

751
00:22:57,653 --> 00:22:58,650
So I struggled on this on accident.

752
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,295
I was like, okay, there's
other people on laptops

753
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,240
working on their startup
or working remotely.

754
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,230
Back then nobody worked remotely,

755
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,482
but they worked on
their businesses, right?

756
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,910
And they would live in
Columbia or Thailand

757
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,620
or Vietnam or Bali.

758
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:16,019
They would live kind of
like in more cheap places.

759
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,089
And it looked a very adventurous life.

760
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:20,699
You travel around, you
build your business.

761
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,948
There's no pressure from
your home society, right?

762
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,240
You're American.

763
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,890
So you get pressure from American society

764
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,880
telling you kind of what to do.

765
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,860
You need to buy a house or
you need to do this stuff.

766
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,329
I had this in Holland too.

767
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:32,039
And you can get away from this pressure.

768
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,940
You can kind of feel like you're free.

769
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,900
There's nobody telling you what to do.

770
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,630
But that's also why you start
feeling like you go crazy

771
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,980
'cause you are free,

772
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,073
you're disattached from
anything and anybody,

773
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,170
you're disattached from your culture.

774
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,880
You're disattached from the
culture you're probably in,

775
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,290
'cause you're staying very short.

776
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:53,730
- I think Franz Kafka said,
"I'm free, therefore I'm lost."

777
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,900
- Man, that's so true.

778
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,610
Yeah, that's exactly the point.

779
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,109
And yeah, freedom is like,

780
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,059
it's the definition of
no constraints, right?

781
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,200
Anything is possible.

782
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,850
You can go anywhere.

783
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,490
And everybody's like, "Oh,
that must be super nice."

784
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,109
Freedom, you must be very happy.

785
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,359
And it's opposites, I don't
think that makes you happy.

786
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,099
I think constraints
probably make you happy,

787
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,049
and that's a big lesson I learned then.

788
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,824
- But what were they making for money?

789
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:18,610
So you're saying they were
doing shady stuff at that time?

790
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:20,909
- For me, 'cause I was
more like a developer.

791
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,230
I wanted to make startups kind of,

792
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:27,230
and it was like drugs
being shipped to America,

793
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:29,339
like diet pills and stuff.

794
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,079
Non-FDA proof stuff.

795
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,501
And they would like let...

796
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,619
They would say with beers

797
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:35,519
and they would laugh about like

798
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,263
all the dodgy shit kind of they're doing.

799
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:39,419
- That part of, okay.
- That kind of vibe.

800
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,340
Kind of sleazy, e-comm vibe.

801
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:43,619
I'm not saying all e-comm is these.

802
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:44,759
- Right.
- But, you know, this vibe.

803
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,720
- It could be a vibe

804
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,264
and your vibe was more build cool shit.

805
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:50,009
- Make cool stuff.
- That's ethical.

806
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,720
- You know, the guys with
sports cars in Dubai,

807
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,069
these people, you know.
- Yes.

808
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:55,379
- E-comm like, oh bro,
you gotta drop ship.

809
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,213
- Yeah.

810
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,750
- And you'll make 100 million a month.

811
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,190
Those people was this shit.

812
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,110
And I was like, this is not my people.

813
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:03,179
- Yeah, I mean there's nothing wrong

814
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,620
with any of those individual components.

815
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:05,452
- No, no judgment.

816
00:25:05,452 --> 00:25:10,170
- But there's a foundation
that's not quite ethical.

817
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,003
What is that?

818
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:12,389
I don't know what that
is, but yeah, I get you.

819
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,890
- No, I don't wanna judge.

820
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,720
I noted for me, it wasn't my world,

821
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,980
it wasn't my subculture.

822
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,870
I wanted to make cool shit.

823
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,819
But they also think their shit is cool.

824
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:25,109
But I wanted to make real
startups and that was my thing.

825
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,449
I would read Hacker
News, like Y Combinator,

826
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,920
and they were making cool stuff.

827
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,873
So I wanted to make cool stuff.

828
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,460
- I mean, that's a
pretty cool way of life.

829
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,680
Just if you romanticize it for a moment.

830
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,930
- It's very romantic man.

831
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:37,799
It's colorful.

832
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,029
If I think about the memories.

833
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,740
- What are some happy memories?

834
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,089
Just like working,

835
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,839
working in cafes or working in

836
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,299
just the freedom that envelopes you

837
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:51,779
from that way of life,

838
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:52,829
'cause anything is possible,

839
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:54,689
you can just get off of.
- I think it was amazing.

840
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,523
We would work.

841
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,059
I would make friends

842
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:02,059
and we would work until 6:00
AM in Bali, for example,

843
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,909
with Andre, my best friend

844
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,040
was still my best friend
and another friend,

845
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,569
and we would work until the morning

846
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,829
when the sun came up.

847
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:13,230
Because at night, the
coworking space was silence.

848
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,329
There was nobody else.

849
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,149
And I would wake up 6:00 PM or 5:00 PM.

850
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,550
I would drive to the coworking
space on a motorbike.

851
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:24,419
I would buy 30 hot lattes from a cafe.

852
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,220
- How many?
- 30.

853
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,769
'Cause there was like six people coming

854
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:29,603
or we didn't know.

855
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:30,596
Sometimes people would come in.

856
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:32,579
- Did you say three, zero, 30?

857
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:33,960
- Yeah.
- Nice.

858
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,819
- And we would drink like
four per person or something.

859
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,439
- Yeah.
- Man, it's Bali.

860
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know if they were powerful lattes,

861
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,460
but they were lattes and
we'd put 'em in a plastic bag

862
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,450
and then we'd drive there

863
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,706
and all the coffee was
like falling everywhere.

864
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:45,538
- [Lex] Yeah.

865
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:46,559
- And then we'd go negotiate

866
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,879
and have these coffees here

867
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,560
and we'd work all night.

868
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,059
We'd play like techno music,

869
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,129
and everybody would just work in there.

870
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,735
This was literally like business people.

871
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:55,567
They would work in their startup

872
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:57,569
and we'd all try and make something.

873
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:58,950
And then the sun would come up

874
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,990
and the morning people,

875
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,059
the yoga,

876
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,919
yoga girls and yoga guys would come in

877
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,330
after the yoga class at six,

878
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,769
and they'd say, "Hey, good morning."

879
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,329
And we're like, we look like this.

880
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:10,379
- Yeah.
- And we're like,

881
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,400
what's up, how are you doing?

882
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,170
And we didn't know how bad we looked,

883
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,490
but it was very bad.

884
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,029
And then we'd go home,
sleep in a hostel or a hotel

885
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,399
and do the same thing and
again and again and again.

886
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,613
And it was this lock-in
mode, like working.

887
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,250
And that was very fun.

888
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,079
- So it's just a bunch of you

889
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,119
techno music blasting

890
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,379
all through the night, yeah.

891
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,000
- More like (imitates techno music)

892
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,900
Like industrial.
- Rap chase.

893
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,647
- Not like this cheesy.

894
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:39,149
- For me, it's such an interesting thing

895
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,320
because the speed of the beat

896
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,289
affects how I feel about a thing.

897
00:27:41,289 --> 00:27:43,379
- Yeah.
- So the faster it is,

898
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,490
the more anxiety I feel.

899
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,099
But that anxiety is
channeled into productivity.

900
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,842
But if it's a little too fast,

901
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:50,633
the anxiety overpowers that.

902
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,529
- So you don't like drum bass music?

903
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:53,363
- No, probably not.

904
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,943
- No, it's too fast.
- I mean, for working,

905
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,339
I have to play with it.
- Yeah.

906
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,470
- It's like you can actually,

907
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,880
I can adjust my-
- Yeah.

908
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,230
- Level of anxiety.

909
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,000
There's a must be a
better word than anxiety.

910
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,150
It's like productive anxiety

911
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,080
that I like.
- Yeah.

912
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:07,913
- Whatever that is.

913
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,019
- It also depends what
kind of work you do, right?

914
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,289
If you're writing,

915
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:11,819
you probably don't want drum bass music.

916
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:14,399
I think for codes like industrial techno,

917
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,410
this kind of stuff, kind of fast.

918
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,930
It works well, 'cause
you really get locked in

919
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,632
and combined with caffeine,

920
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,490
you go deep.
- (laughs) Yeah.

921
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,009
- And I think you balance
on this edge of anxiety,

922
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,557
'cause this caffeine is
also hitting your anxiety.

923
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:29,460
And you want to be on the edge of anxiety

924
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,420
with this techno running.

925
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,830
Sometimes it gets too much.

926
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,192
It's like stop the techno,
stop the music is like,

927
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,386
but those are good memories.

928
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:38,009
And also like travel memories.

929
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,839
You go from city to city.
- Yeah.

930
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,720
- And it feels like, it's
kinda like jet set life.

931
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,159
It's feels very beautiful.

932
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,590
You're seeing a lot of cool cities.

933
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:47,423
- What was your favorite place

934
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:49,980
that you remember, you visited?

935
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,980
- I think still Bangkok is the best place.

936
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,220
And Bangkok and Chiang Mai.

937
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,170
I think Thailand is very special.

938
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,700
I've been to the other place.

939
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,533
I've been to Vietnam

940
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,369
and I've been to South America and stuff.

941
00:29:02,369 --> 00:29:05,759
I still think Thailand wins
in how nice people are.

942
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,430
How easy of a life people have there.

943
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,960
- Everything is cheap.

944
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,793
- Yeah.
- And good.

945
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,849
- Well, Bangkok is getting expensive now,

946
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,559
but Chiang Mai is still cheap.

947
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,759
I think when you're starting out.

948
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,109
It's a great place.

949
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,250
Man, the air quality sucks.

950
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,200
It's a big problem.

951
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,213
And it's quite hot.

952
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:21,752
But that's a very cool place.

953
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,819
- [Lex] Pros and cons.

954
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:25,019
- I love Brazil also.

955
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,759
My girlfriend is Brazilian.

956
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,960
Not just because of
that, but I like Brazil.

957
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,264
The problem still is the safety issue.

958
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,470
It's like in America, like it's localized.

959
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,730
It's hard for Europeans to understand.

960
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,039
Safety is localized to specific areas.

961
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,839
So if you go to the right
areas, it's amazing.

962
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:40,709
Brazil is amazing.

963
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,470
If you go to wrong areas, maybe you die.

964
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,400
Right?
- Yeah.

965
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,660
Yeah, I mean that's true.

966
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,130
- But it's not true in Europe.

967
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,023
In Europe it's much more-
- That's true.

968
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,379
That's true.
- More average.

969
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,000
- You're right, you're right.

970
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,717
It's more averaged out.
- Yeah.

971
00:29:52,717 --> 00:29:54,900
- I like it when there's
strong neighborhoods,

972
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,630
when you're like, you
cross a certain street

973
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,910
and you're in a dangerous part of town.

974
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:00,783
- Man, yeah.

975
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,483
- I like it.

976
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:03,316
I like there's certain cities

977
00:30:03,316 --> 00:30:04,559
in the United States like that.

978
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,549
- Yeah.
- I like that.

979
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:06,494
And you're saying Europe
is more about that.

980
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:08,487
- But you don't feel scared?

981
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:09,321
- Well, I don't,

982
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,219
I like danger.
- Well, you BJJ.

983
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,480
- No, not even just that.

984
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,519
I think dangers interesting.
- Yeah.

985
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,089
- Danger reveals something
about yourself, about others.

986
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,129
Also, I like the full range of humanity.

987
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,090
- Yeah.
- So I don't like

988
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:23,339
the mellowed out aspects of humanity.

989
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,173
- I have friends like,

990
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,890
nomad friends that are exactly like this.

991
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,003
They go to the kind of broken areas.

992
00:30:29,002 --> 00:30:30,332
They like this reality.

993
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:32,190
They like the authenticity more.

994
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,120
They don't like luxury.

995
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,129
They don't like-
- Oh, yeah, I hate luxury.

996
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

997
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,950
- It's very European view, right? (laughs)

998
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,682
- Wait, was that?
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

999
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:40,799
That's a whole nother conversation.

1000
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,633
- Yeah.

1001
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:46,387
- So you quoted Freya Stark quote,

1002
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,249
"To awaken quite alone in a strange town

1003
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:52,471
is one of the most pleasant
sensations in the world."

1004
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:55,589
- Yeah.
- Do you remember a time

1005
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:58,319
you had woken in a strange
town and felt like that?

1006
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,389
We're talking about small
towns or big towns or?

1007
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,223
- Man, anywhere.

1008
00:31:01,222 --> 00:31:03,740
I think I wrote it in some
blog posts and like...

1009
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,750
It was a common thing
when you would wake up

1010
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,130
and this was like...

1011
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,963
I have this website.

1012
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:10,559
I started a website about
this digital nomads,

1013
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,836
called nomadlist.com.

1014
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:12,959
And this was a community,

1015
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,687
so it was like 3,000 other digital nomads,

1016
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:15,990
'cause I was feeling lonely.

1017
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,390
So I built this website and
I stopped feeling lonely.

1018
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,950
I started organizing
meetups and making friends

1019
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,670
and it was very common
that people would say,

1020
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,310
they would wake up and they
would forget where they are.

1021
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,099
- Yeah.
- For the first half minute.

1022
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,480
And I had to look
outside like, where am I?

1023
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,890
Which country?

1024
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,880
Which sounds really like privileged,

1025
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,177
but it was more like funny.

1026
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:35,819
You literally don't know where you are

1027
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,262
because you're so disrooted.

1028
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,019
But there's something...

1029
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,639
Man, it's like Anthony Bourdain.

1030
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,960
There's something pure about this kinda

1031
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,240
vagabond travel thing.

1032
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,781
It's behind me, I think.

1033
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,210
Now I travel with my girlfriend, right?

1034
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,043
It's very different.

1035
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,579
But it is a romantic,

1036
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,279
memories of this kind of like vagabond,

1037
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,349
individualistic solo life.

1038
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,669
But the thing, it didn't make me happy,

1039
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,509
but it was very cool.

1040
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,619
But it didn't make me happy, right?

1041
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,239
It made me anxious.

1042
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,676
- There's something about
it that make you anxious.

1043
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:06,509
I don't know, I still feel like that,

1044
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,009
it's a cool feeling.

1045
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,089
It's scary at first,

1046
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,839
but then you realize where you are.

1047
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,699
I don't know, it's like you awaken

1048
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,500
to the possibilities of this place-

1049
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,614
- That's it.
- When you feel like that.

1050
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:18,626
- That's it.
- That's great.

1051
00:32:18,626 --> 00:32:20,944
And it's even when you're
doing some basic travel.

1052
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:21,778
- [Pieter] Yeah.

1053
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,860
- Go to San Francisco or something else.

1054
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:24,206
- Yeah, you have like the novelty effect.

1055
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:26,190
You're in a new place.

1056
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,552
Here things are possible.

1057
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:29,102
You don't get bored yet.

1058
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:33,779
And that's why people
get addicted to travel.

1059
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:34,613
- Back to startups.

1060
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,980
You wrote a book on how to do this thing

1061
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,890
and gave a great talk on
it, how to do startups.

1062
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,250
The book is called "Make:
Bootstrapper's Handbook."

1063
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,180
- Yeah.
- I was wondering

1064
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,890
if you could go through some of the steps.

1065
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,630
It's idea, build, launch, grow,

1066
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,656
monetize, automate, and exit.

1067
00:32:50,655 --> 00:32:52,500
There's a lot of fascinating
ideas in each one.

1068
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,355
So idea stage.
- Yeah.

1069
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:56,383
- How do you find a good idea?

1070
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:58,650
- So I think you need to
be able to spot problems.

1071
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,660
So for example, you can
go in your daily life,

1072
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,009
when you wake up and you're like,

1073
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:04,210
what are stuff that I'm
really annoyed with?

1074
00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:08,250
In my daily life that
doesn't function well,

1075
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,319
and that's a problem that you can see.

1076
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,069
Okay, maybe that's something
I can add, write code about,

1077
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:16,379
code for and it will make my life easier.

1078
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,510
So I would say make like a list

1079
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:18,750
of all these problems you have

1080
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,130
and like an idea to solve it,

1081
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,470
and see which one is like viable.

1082
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,803
You can actually do something
and then start building it.

1083
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:27,153
- So that's a really good place to start.

1084
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,679
Become open to all the
problems in your life.

1085
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,940
Like actually start noticing them.

1086
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,870
- Yeah.
- I think that's actually

1087
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:35,069
not a true real thing to do,

1088
00:33:35,069 --> 00:33:38,069
to realize that some aspects of your life

1089
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,269
could be done way, way better.

1090
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,650
- Yeah.
- Because we kinda

1091
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,040
very quickly get
accustomed to discomforts.

1092
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,509
- [Pieter] Exactly.

1093
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,549
- Like for example, like doorknobs.

1094
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:48,450
- [Pieter] Yeah.

1095
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,850
- Design of certain things. (laughs)

1096
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:52,109
- I knew you like scream and doorknob.

1097
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:52,942
- Yeah.
- 50 tons.

1098
00:33:52,942 --> 00:33:54,849
- Well, that one I know how much

1099
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,007
incredible design work has gone into.

1100
00:33:58,007 --> 00:33:59,430
It's a really interesting.

1101
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,930
- Yeah.
- Doors and doorknobs.

1102
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,949
Just the design of everyday things.

1103
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:04,531
- Yeah.
- Forks and spoons.

1104
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,569
It's gonna be hard to come up with a fork

1105
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:07,500
that's better than the current-

1106
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,358
- Yeah.
- Fork designs.

1107
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,350
- Yeah.
- And the other aspect of it

1108
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,250
is you're saying like,

1109
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,690
in order to come up
with interesting ideas,

1110
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,570
you gotta try to live a
more interesting life.

1111
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,367
- Yeah, but that's where travel comes in.

1112
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,269
- [Lex] Yeah.

1113
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:19,259
- Because when I started traveling,

1114
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,150
I started seeing stuff in other countries

1115
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,950
that you didn't have
in Europe, for example,

1116
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:23,969
or America even.

1117
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,112
If you go to Asia,

1118
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,590
dude, especially 10 years ago,

1119
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,150
nobody knew about this WeChats,

1120
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,980
all these apps that they already had

1121
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,150
before we had them,

1122
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,710
these everything apps, right?

1123
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,940
Now Elon's trying to make X,

1124
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,298
this everything app
like WeChat, same thing.

1125
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:39,809
In Indonesia or Thailand,

1126
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,179
you have one app that you can order food,

1127
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,169
if you can order groceries,

1128
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,539
you can order massage,

1129
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:48,090
you can order car mechanic.

1130
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,160
Anything you can think of is in the app.

1131
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,873
And that stuff, for example,

1132
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,910
that's called arbitrage.

1133
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,016
You can go to back to your country

1134
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:58,019
and build that same app for
your country, for example.

1135
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:01,559
So you start seeing problems,

1136
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,460
you start seeing solutions

1137
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,460
that other people already
did in the rest of the world.

1138
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,599
And also traveling in general

1139
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,719
just gives you more problems,

1140
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,269
'cause travel is uncomfortable.

1141
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,350
Airports are horrible.

1142
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,019
Airplanes are not comfortable either.

1143
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:17,579
There's a lot of problems
you start seeing,

1144
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,409
just getting outta your house, you know.

1145
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,266
- But also you can, I
mean in the digital world

1146
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,699
you can just go into different communities

1147
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,346
and see what can be improved-

1148
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:26,179
- Yes.
- In that.

1149
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1150
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,960
- What specifically is your
process of generating ideas?

1151
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,210
Do you like do idea dumps?

1152
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,449
Do you have a document where
you just keep writing stuff?

1153
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,029
- Yeah, I used to have like a...

1154
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,380
'Cause when I wasn't making money,

1155
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,836
I was trying to like make this
list of ideas to see like,

1156
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,759
so I need to build...

1157
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,960
I was thinking statistically already,

1158
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,947
like I need to build all these things,

1159
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:45,750
and one of these will work out probably.

1160
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,003
So I need to have a lot of things to try.

1161
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,273
And I did that.

1162
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,120
Right now I think like,

1163
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,079
because I already have money,

1164
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,440
I can do more things based on technology.

1165
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,030
So for example, AI,

1166
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,993
when I found out about

1167
00:35:57,992 --> 00:36:00,963
when Stable Diffusion
came or ChatGPT and stuff,

1168
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:02,793
all these things were like,

1169
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,510
I didn't start working with
them because I had a problem.

1170
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,890
I had no problems.

1171
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:10,500
But I was very curious about technology

1172
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,536
and I was like playing with it

1173
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,250
and figuring out like...

1174
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,083
First just playing with it

1175
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:16,769
and then you find something like,

1176
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,630
okay, this generates...

1177
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,829
Stable Diffusion generates houses

1178
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,630
very beautiful and interiors.

1179
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,860
- So it's less about problem solving,

1180
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,120
it's more about the possibilities

1181
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,380
of new things you can create.

1182
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,000
- Yeah, but that's very risky

1183
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,139
because that's the famous like

1184
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:29,279
solution trying to find a problem.

1185
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,113
- Yeah.

1186
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,409
- And usually, it doesn't work.

1187
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:33,239
And that's very common with startup funds.

1188
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:35,009
I think they have tech,

1189
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,070
but actually people don't
need the tech, right?

1190
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,930
- Can you actually explain,

1191
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,819
it'd be cool to talk about some
of the stuff you've created.

1192
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,653
Can you explain

1193
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,241
the photoai.com?

1194
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,969
- Yeah, yeah, so it's like
fire your photographer.

1195
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:49,739
The idea is like, you don't
need a photography anymore.

1196
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:52,409
You can train yourself as AI model

1197
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:53,420
and you can take as many photos

1198
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
as you want anywhere in any clothes

1199
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,019
with facial expressions,

1200
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,429
like happy or sad,

1201
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:02,078
or poses, all this stuff.

1202
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,450
- So how does it work?

1203
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:04,282
- Yeah.

1204
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:06,329
- (laughs) You send me.

1205
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,889
- So you could press-
- A link to a gallery

1206
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,449
of ones done on me.
- Yeah.

1207
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:10,282
- Which is?

1208
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:11,699
- So on the left you
have the prompt, the box.

1209
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:12,779
Yeah, so you can write like,

1210
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,700
so model is your model, this Lex Fridman.

1211
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,500
- Yeah.
- So you can write like model

1212
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,360
as a blah, blah, blah, whatever you want.

1213
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,740
- Yep.
- Then press the button

1214
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,572
and it will take photos.

1215
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,779
It will take one minute.

1216
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,430
- Photos, what are you
using for the hosting

1217
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:25,289
for the compute?
- Replicate.

1218
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:26,460
- Okay.
- Replicate.com.

1219
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,840
They're very, very good.

1220
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,090
- Okay, it's cool like
this interface wise.

1221
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,010
It's cool that you're showing
how long it's gonna take.

1222
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,180
This is amazing.

1223
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,699
So I'm presuming you just loaded

1224
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,589
in a few pictures from the internet.

1225
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,620
- Yeah, so I went to Google Images,

1226
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:39,809
typed in Lex Fridman.

1227
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,880
I added like 10 or 20 images.

1228
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,800
You can open 'em in the gallery,

1229
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,293
and you can use your cursor to, yeah.

1230
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,389
So some don't look like you,

1231
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:50,699
so the hit and miss rate is like,

1232
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:53,579
I don't know, I'd say
like 50/50 or something.

1233
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:54,456
- But when I was watching it tweet,

1234
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:56,730
like it's been getting
better and better and better.

1235
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,050
- It was very bad in the beginning.

1236
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,883
It was so bad.

1237
00:37:58,882 --> 00:38:00,989
But still people sign up to it, you know.

1238
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:04,849
- (laughs) There's two Lex is great.

1239
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,509
It is getting more and more sexual.

1240
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,070
It's making me very uncomfortable.

1241
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,562
- Man, but that's the
problem with these models.

1242
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:10,496
'cause
(Lex laughs)

1243
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,340
we need to talk about this,

1244
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,420
'cause the models-
- I'm sure.

1245
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,253
- In Stable Diffusion.

1246
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:14,160
- Yeah.
- So the photo

1247
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,509
realistic models that are like fine tunes.

1248
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,343
- [Lex] Yeah.

1249
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:18,539
- They were all trained
on porn in the beginning.

1250
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,134
And it was a guy called Hassan.

1251
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:21,360
So I was trying to figure out

1252
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,490
how to do photo realistic AI photos.

1253
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,649
Stable Diffusion by itself
is not doing that well.

1254
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,452
The faces look all mangled.
- Yep.

1255
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:29,939
- And it doesn't have enough resolution

1256
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,039
or something to do that well.

1257
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,650
But I started seeing these base models,

1258
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,840
these fine models and
people would train on porn

1259
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,750
and I would try them and they
would be very photorealistic.

1260
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,730
They would have bodies
that actually made sense

1261
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,043
like body anatomy.

1262
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,190
But if you look at the
photo realistic models

1263
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,023
that people use now,

1264
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,730
still, there's still core of porn there,

1265
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,563
of naked people.
- Yeah.

1266
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,309
- So I need to prompt out the naked

1267
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,690
and everyone needs to do
this with AI startups,

1268
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,590
with imaging.

1269
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,880
You need to prompt out the naked stuff.

1270
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,849
You need to put a naked-

1271
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:01,500
- You have to keep reminding the model.

1272
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,699
You need to put clothes on the thing.

1273
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,349
- Yeah, don't put naked
'cause it's very risky.

1274
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,380
I have Google Vision that checks-

1275
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,390
- Yeah.
- Every photo

1276
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:07,949
before it's shown to the user

1277
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,719
to like check for NSFW.
- Like the nipple detector.

1278
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,339
Oh, NSFW detector.

1279
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,380
- Because the journalists get very angry

1280
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,480
if they, you know.
- If you sexualized.

1281
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,313
- There was a journalist I think,

1282
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:17,146
that would got angry to use this.

1283
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,800
And it was like, oh, it
showed like a nipple,

1284
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,780
'cause Google Vision didn't detect it.

1285
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,269
So that's like these kind of problems

1286
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,170
you need to deal with,

1287
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,579
that's what I'm talking about.

1288
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:27,632
This is with cats.

1289
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,909
But look at the cat face.

1290
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,841
It's also kind of mangled.

1291
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:33,259
(Lex laughs)

1292
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:36,450
- I'm a little bit disturbed.

1293
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,878
- Can zoom in on the cat if you want.

1294
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,851
Yeah, it's a very sad cut.

1295
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:41,750
(Lex laughs)

1296
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,706
It doesn't have a nose.

1297
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:43,710
- It doesn't have a nose.

1298
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,699
Wow.

1299
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:45,826
- Man, but this is the
problem with AI startup

1300
00:39:45,827 --> 00:39:47,943
'cause they all act like it's perfect.

1301
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:49,740
This is groundbreaking.

1302
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:50,572
But it's not perfect.
- Yeah.

1303
00:39:50,572 --> 00:39:53,099
- It's like really bad half the time.

1304
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,799
- So if I wanted to
sort of update model as?

1305
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,970
- Yeah, so you remove this stuff

1306
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:59,309
and you write whatever you want,

1307
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,840
like in Thailand or something,

1308
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,043
or in Tokyo.

1309
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:04,682
- In Tokyo?
- Yeah.

1310
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,072
- And then-

1311
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,690
- You could say like at
night with neon lights,

1312
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,639
you can add more detail to make you.

1313
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:12,509
- I'll go in Austin.

1314
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,343
Do you think you'll know in Texas?

1315
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:14,849
- Yeah, Austin.
- In Austin, Texas.

1316
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,871
- With cowboy hats.
- In Texas, yeah.

1317
00:40:16,871 --> 00:40:18,213
- As a cowboy.

1318
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,140
- As a cowboy.

1319
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,349
It's gonna go towards the porn direction.

1320
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:26,182
Man, I hope not.

1321
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:27,382
It's the end of my career.

1322
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:28,559
(Pieter and Lex laughs)

1323
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,329
- Or the beginning, it depends.

1324
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:31,739
We can send you a push notification

1325
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:32,572
when your photos are done.

1326
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:33,650
Yeah, all right, cool.

1327
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,940
- Yeah, let's see.
- Oh, wow.

1328
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,708
So this whole interface you've built.

1329
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:39,244
- Yeah.
- This is really well done.

1330
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:40,582
- It's so jQuery.

1331
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:42,101
- So I still use jQuery.
- Yes.

1332
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:43,022
- The only one.
- Still.

1333
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,039
- After 10 years.
- To this day.

1334
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:46,529
You're not the only one,
the entire of the web.

1335
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,829
- Yeah.
- This PHP.

1336
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:48,695
- PHP and jQuery.

1337
00:40:48,695 --> 00:40:49,980
Yeah, SQLite.

1338
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,860
- You're just like one
of the top performers

1339
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,210
from a programming perspective

1340
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,659
that are still openly talking about it.

1341
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,012
But everyone's using PHP.

1342
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,769
Most of the web is still
probably PHP and jQuery.

1343
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:03,677
- I think 70%, 'cause of WordPress, right?

1344
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,277
'Cause the blogs are-
- Yeah, that's true.

1345
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,599
- Yeah.
- That's true.

1346
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,860
- I'm seeing a revival now.

1347
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,760
People are getting sick of frameworks.

1348
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,000
Like all the JavaScript frameworks are

1349
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,469
so like, what do you call it?

1350
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:14,369
Like wieldy,

1351
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:17,489
so it takes so much work
to just maintain this code

1352
00:41:17,489 --> 00:41:19,469
and then it updates to a new version.

1353
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:20,519
You need to change everything.

1354
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,730
PHP just stays the same and works.

1355
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,699
- Yeah, can you actually
just speak to that stack?

1356
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:30,359
You build all your websites,
apps, startups, projects,

1357
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,390
all of that with mostly vanilla HTML.

1358
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:35,009
- [Pieter] Yeah, yeah..

1359
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:39,073
- JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQLite.

1360
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:43,170
And so that's a really simple stack,

1361
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,003
and you get stuff-
- Yeah.

1362
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:44,910
- Done really fast.

1363
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:47,339
Can you just speak to the
philosophy behind that?

1364
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,173
- I think it's accidental,
'cause that's the thing I knew,

1365
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:52,876
like I knew PHP, I knew HTML, CSS,

1366
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,809
'cause you make websites

1367
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:57,900
and when my startups started taking off,

1368
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,460
I didn't have time to...

1369
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,697
I remember putting on my
to-do list like learn Node.js,

1370
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:03,750
'cause it's important to switch,

1371
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,583
'cause-
- Yeah.

1372
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,599
- This obviously is much
better language than PHP,

1373
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,432
and I never learned it.

1374
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:08,394
I never did it,

1375
00:42:08,394 --> 00:42:10,409
'cause I didn't have time.

1376
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:11,940
These things were growing like this,

1377
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,012
and I was launching more
project and I never had time.

1378
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:15,393
It's like one day,

1379
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,859
I'll start coding properly
and I never got to it.

1380
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,079
- I sometimes wonder if I
need to learn that stuff.

1381
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,989
It's still to do for me
to really learn Node.js

1382
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:27,795
or Flask or these kind of-

1383
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,332
- React.
- Yeah, React.

1384
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,430
It feels like a responsible
software engineer

1385
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,699
should know how to use these,

1386
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:42,599
but you can get stuff done so fast

1387
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,279
with vanilla versions of stuff.

1388
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,680
- Yeah, it's like software
developers if you wanna get a job

1389
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,197
and it's like, you know, people
making stuff like startups

1390
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:52,769
and if you want to be
entrepreneur probably

1391
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:53,940
maybe shouldn't, right?

1392
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,139
- I wonder if there's like,

1393
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:58,710
I really wanna measure
performance and speed.

1394
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,159
I think there's a deep wisdom in that.

1395
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:02,399
- Yeah.
- I do think that frameworks

1396
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,820
and just constantly wanting
to learn the new thing

1397
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,080
that's complicated way

1398
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,909
of software engineering gets in the way.

1399
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:10,019
I'm not sure what to say about that

1400
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,420
because definitely like you
shouldn't build everything

1401
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,200
from just vanilla JavaScript
or vanilla C, for example.

1402
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,789
- Yeah.
- C++

1403
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:20,130
when you're building
systems engineering is like,

1404
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,072
there's a lot of benefits
for a pointer safety

1405
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:23,940
and all that kind of stuff.

1406
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,929
So I don't know,

1407
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:26,559
but it just feels like

1408
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:30,059
you can get so much more stuff done

1409
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:31,960
if you don't care about how you do it.

1410
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,040
- Man, this is my most
controversial take, I think,

1411
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,873
and maybe I'm wrong,

1412
00:43:35,873 --> 00:43:40,110
but I feel like there's
frameworks now that raise money.

1413
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,309
They raise a lot of money.

1414
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:44,639
They raise 50 million,
100 million, $30 million.

1415
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:46,916
And the idea is that you
need to make the developers,

1416
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,880
the new developers,

1417
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,849
like when you're 18 or
20 years old, right?

1418
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:54,842
Get them to use this framework
and add a platform to it.

1419
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,509
Where the framework can...

1420
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,470
It's open source,

1421
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,599
but you probably should use the platform

1422
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,339
which is paid to use it.

1423
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,120
And the cost of the platforms to host it

1424
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:09,029
are a thousand times
higher than just hosting it

1425
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,543
on a simple AWS server or a
VPS on DigitalOcean, right?

1426
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:15,570
So there's obviously like
a monetary incentive here.

1427
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,760
We wanna get a lot of developers
to use this technology

1428
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,170
and then we need to charge them money

1429
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,030
'cause they're gonna use it in startups

1430
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,123
and then the starters
can pay for the bills.

1431
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,384
It kind of destroys the
information out there

1432
00:44:29,384 --> 00:44:32,492
about learning to code
because they pay YouTubers,

1433
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:34,739
they pay influencers,

1434
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,649
developer influencers is
a big thing to like...

1435
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,090
And same thing what happens with like

1436
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,650
nutrition and fitness or something.

1437
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,940
Same thing happens in developing,

1438
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,340
they pay this influencer
to promote this stuff,

1439
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,642
use it, make stuff with it,
make demo products with it.

1440
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:47,474
And then a lot of people are like,

1441
00:44:47,474 --> 00:44:48,927
"Wow, use this."

1442
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:49,967
And I started noticing this

1443
00:44:49,967 --> 00:44:51,630
'cause when I would ship my stuff,

1444
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,430
people would ask me, "What are you using?"

1445
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:56,129
I would say, "Just PHP,
jQuery, why does it matter?"

1446
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,547
And people would start
kind of attacking me like,

1447
00:44:57,547 --> 00:44:59,730
"Why are you not using
this new technology,

1448
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,106
this new framework, this new thing?"

1449
00:45:01,106 --> 00:45:03,527
And I say, "I don't know,
'cause this PHP thing works

1450
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:05,689
and I'm optimizing for anything,

1451
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,070
it just works."

1452
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,123
And I never understood like why,

1453
00:45:10,123 --> 00:45:12,450
I understand there's new
technologies that are better

1454
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,409
and there should be improvement,

1455
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:16,349
but I'm very suspicious of money.

1456
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:17,219
Just like lobbying.

1457
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,669
There's money in this
developer framework scene.

1458
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,217
There's hundreds of millions

1459
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:25,050
that goes to ads or
influencer or whatever.

1460
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,580
It can't all go to developers.

1461
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,170
You don't need so many
developers for a framework,

1462
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,220
and it's open source.

1463
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:32,549
To make a lot of more
money on these startups.

1464
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,870
- So that's a really good perspective.

1465
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,542
But in addition to that is
like, when you say better,

1466
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,242
it's like, can we get
some data on the better?

1467
00:45:41,242 --> 00:45:42,076
(Pieter laughs)

1468
00:45:42,076 --> 00:45:43,800
Because I wanna know

1469
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,500
from the individual developer perspective

1470
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,480
and then from a team of five, team of 10,

1471
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,132
team of 20 developers-
- Yeah.

1472
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,950
- Measure how productive they
are in shipping features.

1473
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:57,839
How many bugs they create,

1474
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,600
how many security holes result.

1475
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,279
- PHP was not good with
security for a while,

1476
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,113
but now it's good.

1477
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:04,446
- In theory, in theory-
- Yeah.

1478
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:05,925
- Is it though?
- Now it's good.

1479
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:09,539
- No, now as you're saying it,

1480
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,369
I wanna know if that's true

1481
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,400
because PHP was just the majority-

1482
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,329
- Yeah.
- Of websites on the internet.

1483
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:16,739
- [Pieter] Could be true.

1484
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,059
- Is it just overrepresented?

1485
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:18,992
Same with WordPress?
- Yeah.

1486
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:21,449
- Yes, there's a reputation that WordPress

1487
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:24,179
has a gigantic number of security holes.

1488
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,230
I don't know if that's true.

1489
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,309
I know it gets attacked a
lot because it's so popular.

1490
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:29,143
- [Pieter] Yeah.

1491
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:30,570
- It definitely does have security holes,

1492
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,280
but maybe a lot of other systems

1493
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,540
have security holes as well.

1494
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:35,730
Anyway, I just sort of questioning

1495
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,369
the conventional wisdom
that keeps wanting to push

1496
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:41,639
software engineers towards
frameworks, towards complex.

1497
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:42,472
- [Pieter] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1498
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:44,969
- Like super complicated

1499
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,559
sort of software engineering approaches

1500
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,719
that stretch out the time

1501
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,072
it takes to actually build a thing.

1502
00:46:50,072 --> 00:46:51,059
- Man, 100%.

1503
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,039
And it's the same thing
with big corporations.

1504
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:54,329
80% of the people don't do anything.

1505
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:55,163
It's like-
- Right.

1506
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:56,103
- It's not efficient.

1507
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:02,250
Your benchmark is like
people building stuff

1508
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,280
that actually gets done and
like for society, right?

1509
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,450
If we wanna save time,

1510
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,949
we should probably use technology

1511
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,510
that's simple, that's pragmatic,

1512
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,790
that works, that's not overly complicated.

1513
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:18,119
It doesn't make your
life like a living hell.

1514
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,449
- And use a framework one that
obviously solves a problem,

1515
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,789
a direct problem that you-
- Of course, yeah, of course.

1516
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:25,860
I'm not saying you should
code without a framework.

1517
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,510
You should use whatever you want.

1518
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:30,664
Yeah, think it's suspicious.

1519
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:31,500
(Lex laughs)

1520
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,333
And I think it's suspicious.

1521
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,990
When I talk about it on the Twitter,

1522
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,122
there's this army comes out.
- Yeah.

1523
00:47:35,123 --> 00:47:37,079
- There's these framework armies.

1524
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:37,913
- [Lex] Yeah.

1525
00:47:37,913 --> 00:47:38,746
- Man, something...

1526
00:47:38,746 --> 00:47:40,050
My gut tells me.

1527
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,370
- I wanna ask the framework army,

1528
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:42,659
what have they built this week?

1529
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,309
It's the Elon question.

1530
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:45,143
What did you do this week?

1531
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:46,043
- Yeah, did you make money with it?

1532
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:47,550
Did you charge users?

1533
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,023
Is it a real business?

1534
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,383
Yeah.

1535
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,480
- So going back to the cowboy.

1536
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,949
- First of all, some never
look like you, right?

1537
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:56,782
But some do.

1538
00:47:56,782 --> 00:47:58,469
- Every aspect of this
is pretty incredible.

1539
00:47:58,469 --> 00:47:59,672
I'm also just looking at the interface.

1540
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:00,750
It's really well done.

1541
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,639
So this is all just jQuery.

1542
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:04,379
- Yeah.
- This is really well done.

1543
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,443
So take me through the
journey of Photo AI.

1544
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,870
Most of the world doesn't know
much about Stable Diffusion

1545
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:13,786
or any of this-
- Yeah.

1546
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:15,567
- Any of the generative AI stuff.

1547
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:16,860
And so you're thinking, okay,

1548
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,521
how can I build cool stuff with this?

1549
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,354
- [Pieter] Yeah.

1550
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:21,539
- So what was the origin
story of Photo AI?

1551
00:48:21,539 --> 00:48:23,969
- I think it started, 'cause
Stable Diffusion came out.

1552
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:24,802
So Stable Diffusion is like this-

1553
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:26,369
- Yeah.
- The first like generative

1554
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,259
image model, AI model.

1555
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,820
And I started playing with it,

1556
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,320
like you could install it on your Mac,

1557
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,990
somebody forked it and
made it work for MacBooks.

1558
00:48:33,989 --> 00:48:36,479
So I downloaded it and cloned the Repo,

1559
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,230
started using it to generate images

1560
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:42,679
and it was like amazing.

1561
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:43,949
I found it on Twitter

1562
00:48:43,949 --> 00:48:45,509
because you see things happen on Twitter

1563
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,960
and I would post what I was
making on Twitter as well

1564
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,460
and you could make any image,

1565
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,389
you could write a prompt.

1566
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,829
So essentially write a prompt

1567
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,809
and then it generates a photo of that

1568
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:57,329
or image of that in any style.

1569
00:48:57,329 --> 00:48:58,677
They would use like artist names

1570
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:01,027
to make like a Picasso
kind of style and stuff.

1571
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:06,039
And I was trying to see
like what is it good at?

1572
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,050
Is it good at people?

1573
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,970
No, it's really bad at people,

1574
00:49:08,969 --> 00:49:10,199
but it was good at houses.

1575
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,168
So architecture, for example,

1576
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:13,652
I would generate like architecture houses.

1577
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,410
So I made a website called
thishousedoesnotexist.org.

1578
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,250
And it generated like,

1579
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,981
they called it like
house porn at that one.

1580
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:23,100
(Lex laughs)

1581
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,656
House porn is like a subreddit.

1582
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:26,490
And this was Stable Diffusion
like the first version.

1583
00:49:26,489 --> 00:49:27,359
So it looks really...

1584
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,960
You can click for another photo.

1585
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,990
So it generates all these
kind of non-existing houses.

1586
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:34,979
- It is house porn.

1587
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,570
- But it looked kind of good.

1588
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,559
Especially back then.

1589
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:38,393
- It looks really good.

1590
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,626
- Now things look much better.

1591
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,343
- That's really, really well done.

1592
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:47,032
Wow.

1593
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:48,889
- And it also generates
like a description.

1594
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,389
- And you can upvote.

1595
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:52,222
Is it nice?
- Yeah.

1596
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,056
- Upvote it.
- Yeah.

1597
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,633
- Man, there's so much
to talk to you about.

1598
00:49:54,632 --> 00:49:56,339
Like the choices here.
(Pieter chuckles)

1599
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,019
It's really well done.
- This is very scrappy.

1600
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,190
In the bottom, there's like a ranking

1601
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,200
of the most upvoted houses.

1602
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,250
So these are the top vote.

1603
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,210
And if you go to old time,

1604
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,659
you see quite beautiful ones.

1605
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:07,019
Yeah, so this one is my favorite.

1606
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,719
The number one, it's kinda like a.

1607
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,539
- How is this not more popular?

1608
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:14,009
- It was really popular for like a while,

1609
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,547
but then people got so
bored of it, I think,

1610
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,990
'cause I was getting bored of it too.

1611
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:20,879
Just continuous house porn.

1612
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,559
Everything starts looking the same.

1613
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,440
But then I saw it was
really good at interior,

1614
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,539
so I pivoted to interiorai.com where

1615
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,789
I tried to like upload first
generate interior designs.

1616
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:34,356
And then I tried to do like,

1617
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:36,539
there was a new technology
called Image to Image

1618
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:38,661
where you can input an
image, like a photo,

1619
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,970
and it would kind of modify the thing.

1620
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:43,172
So you see it looks almost
the same as Photo AI.

1621
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,512
It's the same code essentially.

1622
00:50:46,769 --> 00:50:47,603
- Nice.

1623
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:50,130
- So I would upload a photo
of my interior where I lived,

1624
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,519
and I would ask like
change this into like a,

1625
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,940
I don't know, like maximalist design.

1626
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,130
And it worked and it worked really well.

1627
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,960
So I was like, okay, this is a startup,

1628
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,760
'cause obviously interior design AI,

1629
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,290
and nobody's doing that yet.

1630
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:06,090
So I launched this and I was successful

1631
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,870
and made like within a
week, made 10K, 20K a month,

1632
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:13,019
and now still makes like 40K, 50K a month.

1633
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:14,489
And it's been like two years.

1634
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:17,129
So then I was like, how can I
improve this interior design?

1635
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,510
I need to start learning fine tuning.

1636
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:21,270
And fine tuning is where you
have this existing AI model

1637
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:24,269
and you fine tune it on a
specific goal you wanted to do.

1638
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,550
So I would find really
beautiful interior design,

1639
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:30,180
make a gallery and train a new model

1640
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:31,379
that was very good at interior design.

1641
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,480
And it worked and I used that as well.

1642
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,302
And then for fun, I
uploaded photos of myself,

1643
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,269
and here's where it happened.

1644
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,706
And to train myself like,

1645
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,239
and this would never work obviously.

1646
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:43,072
And it worked.

1647
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:46,440
And actually it started
understanding me as a concept.

1648
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,414
So my face worked,

1649
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:49,740
and you could do like different styles,

1650
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,958
me as like very cheesy,

1651
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:54,359
medieval warrior, all this stuff.

1652
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,620
So I was like, this is another startup.

1653
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:58,469
So now I did avatarai.me.

1654
00:51:58,469 --> 00:51:59,969
I couldn't get to.com

1655
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:02,099
And this was-

1656
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,319
- This still up?
- Yeah, avatarai.me.

1657
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,420
Well, now it's forwards to
photo AI, 'cause it pivoted.

1658
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,253
- Got it.

1659
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:09,960
- But this was more like cheesy thing.

1660
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,420
So this is very interesting
'cause this went so viral.

1661
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,260
It made like, I think 150K
in a week or something.

1662
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,560
So most money I ever made.

1663
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:20,786
And then big, this is very interesting,

1664
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:23,009
the big VC companies like Lenze,

1665
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:26,100
which are much better at
iOS and stuff than me,

1666
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,509
I didn't have iOS app.

1667
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,490
They quickly built an iOS
app that does the same.

1668
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:30,359
And they found technology,

1669
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,710
and it's all open technology.

1670
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,543
So it's good.

1671
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:35,309
And I think they made
like $30 million with it.

1672
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:36,143
- [Lex] Yeah.

1673
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:39,092
- They became like the top
grossing app after that.

1674
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:41,909
- How do you feel about that?

1675
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,259
- I think it's amazing, honestly.

1676
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,093
And it's not like-

1677
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:45,306
- You didn't have like a
feeling like, ah, fuck.

1678
00:52:45,306 --> 00:52:48,869
- No, I was a little bit like sad,

1679
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:50,250
'cause all my products would work out

1680
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,289
and I never had like
real fierce competition.

1681
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:53,460
And now I have fierce competition

1682
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,480
from like a very skilled high talent.

1683
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,760
I was developer studio or something that,

1684
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,870
and they already had an app.

1685
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:02,682
They had an app, an App Store for like,

1686
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:04,170
I think retouching your face or something.

1687
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,003
So they were very smart.

1688
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:06,330
They add these avatars to there.

1689
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:07,259
It's a feature.

1690
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,093
They had the users,

1691
00:53:08,092 --> 00:53:09,420
they do a push notification to everybody.

1692
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,409
We have this avatars.

1693
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:11,962
- Yeah.
- Man, they create,

1694
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:13,682
I think they made so much money.

1695
00:53:15,449 --> 00:53:16,769
I think they did a really great job.

1696
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:19,123
And I also made a lot of money with it.

1697
00:53:20,422 --> 00:53:21,887
But I quickly realized it wasn't my thing,

1698
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:23,160
'cause it was so cheesy.

1699
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,480
It was like Kitch,

1700
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,510
it's kind of like me as a Barbie

1701
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,343
or me as a...

1702
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:29,309
- Yeah.
- It was too cheesy.

1703
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:30,299
I wanted to go for like,

1704
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,860
what's a real problem we can solve?

1705
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,693
'Cause this is gonna be a hype.

1706
00:53:32,693 --> 00:53:33,526
This is gonna be,

1707
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,069
and it was a hype, these avatars.

1708
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,300
It's like let's do real photography.

1709
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,460
How can you make people
look really photo realistic?

1710
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,293
And it was difficult.

1711
00:53:42,293 --> 00:53:43,289
And that's why these avatars work,

1712
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,050
'cause they were all like
in a cheesy Picasso style,

1713
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,710
and art is easy 'cause you interpret...

1714
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,510
All the problems that AI has

1715
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,160
with your face are like artistic.

1716
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:54,659
If you call it Picasso.

1717
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:55,769
But if you make a real photo,

1718
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,300
all the problems with your face,

1719
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,173
you look wrong.

1720
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,699
So I started making Photo AI,

1721
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,670
which was like a pivot of it

1722
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:04,269
where it was like a photo studio

1723
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:08,519
where you could take photos
without actually needing,

1724
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,440
a photographer, needing a studio.

1725
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,720
You just type it.

1726
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:14,699
And I've been working on
it for like the last year.

1727
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:15,689
- Yeah, it's really incredible.

1728
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:18,090
That journey is really incredible.

1729
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,250
Let's go to the beginning
of Photo AI though,

1730
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,199
'cause I remember seeing
a lot of really, (laughs)

1731
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,960
really hilarious photos.

1732
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,909
I think you were using
yourself as a case study.

1733
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:27,899
Right?
- Yeah.

1734
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:31,260
- Yeah, so there's a tweet here.

1735
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:36,010
Sold $100,000 in AI generated avatars.

1736
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:37,053
- Yeah, and it's a lot like,

1737
00:54:37,052 --> 00:54:38,190
it's a lot for anybody.

1738
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:39,153
It's a lot for me.

1739
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:40,880
(Lex laughs)

1740
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,629
Making 10K a day on this, you know.

1741
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,073
- That's amazing.

1742
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:46,709
That's amazing.

1743
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,090
- And then the nested tweet,

1744
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:50,010
like that's the launch tweet,

1745
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,810
and then the before that it's
like the me hacking on it.

1746
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,110
- Oh, I see.

1747
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,000
So that...

1748
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,663
Okay, so October 26th, 2022.

1749
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,496
- Yeah.

1750
00:55:00,496 --> 00:55:03,093
- I trained an ML model on my face.

1751
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,810
- Because my eyes are quite far apart.

1752
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:08,279
I learned when I did YouTube,

1753
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,430
I would put a photo of like
my DJ photo, my mixture.

1754
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:14,429
And people would say I look
like a hammerhead shark.

1755
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:15,299
It was like the top comment.

1756
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,843
So then I realized my eyes are far apart.

1757
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:19,679
- Yeah, the internet helps you figure out

1758
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:20,687
who you look like.
- Yeah,

1759
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:21,869
helps realize how you look.

1760
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:23,418
- Boy, do I love the internet.

1761
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:24,751
- So first trap.

1762
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,090
- Well what is, is this?

1763
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:27,923
Wait.

1764
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:29,669
- It's water from the waterfall,

1765
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,990
but the waterfalls in the back,

1766
00:55:30,989 --> 00:55:32,439
you know, so what's going on?

1767
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,820
- So how much of this is real?

1768
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,840
- It's all AI.

1769
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,970
- It's all AI.
- Yeah.

1770
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,769
- That's pretty good,
though, for the early days.

1771
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:41,603
- Exactly.

1772
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:42,436
But this was hit or miss,

1773
00:55:42,436 --> 00:55:43,890
so you had to do a lot of curation,

1774
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:46,079
'cause 99% of it was really bad.

1775
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,670
So these are the photos I uploaded.

1776
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,050
- How many photos did you use?

1777
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:53,010
Only these, I will try more
up to date picks later.

1778
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,781
These are the only photos you uploaded?

1779
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,462
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

1780
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,818
Wow, okay, so you were learning
all this super quickly.

1781
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:02,759
- [Pieter] Yeah.

1782
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,410
- What are some interesting details

1783
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:05,429
you remember from that time

1784
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,889
for what you had to figure
out to make it work?

1785
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:09,299
And for people just listening,

1786
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,360
he uploaded just a handful of photos

1787
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,329
that don't really have a
good capture of the face.

1788
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:16,362
And he is able to-

1789
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:17,195
- I think it's cropped,

1790
00:56:17,195 --> 00:56:18,900
it's like a cropped by the layout.

1791
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,579
But they're square photos.

1792
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,440
So they're 512 by 512,

1793
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,599
because that's Stable Diffusion.

1794
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:27,119
- But nevertheless not
great capture the face.

1795
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:27,952
- Yeah.

1796
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:32,952
- It's not like a collection
of several hundred photos

1797
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:34,826
that are like 360 overview.
- Exactly.

1798
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,536
I would imagine that too
when I started I was like,

1799
00:56:36,536 --> 00:56:39,569
oh, this must be like some
3D scan technology, right?

1800
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,403
- Yeah.
- So I think

1801
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:41,235
the cool thing with AI,

1802
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:42,420
it trains the concept of you.

1803
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,403
So it's literally like learning,

1804
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,609
just like any AI model learns,
it learns how you look.

1805
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,032
So I did this and then I was getting DMs,

1806
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,190
like Telegram messages,

1807
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,150
how can I do the same thing?

1808
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,349
I want these photos.

1809
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:56,670
My girlfriend wants these photos.

1810
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,816
So I was like, okay, this
is obviously a business,

1811
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,769
but I didn't have time to code it,

1812
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:03,090
make a whole like app about it.

1813
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,553
So I made a HTML page,

1814
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,983
registered domain name.

1815
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:11,010
It was a Stripe payment link,

1816
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,520
which means you have literally
a link to Stripe to pay,

1817
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:15,759
but there's no code in the back.

1818
00:57:15,759 --> 00:57:18,543
So all you know is you have
customers that paid money.

1819
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,349
Then I added like some a Typeform link.

1820
00:57:22,349 --> 00:57:23,250
So Typeform is a site

1821
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,469
where you can create your own

1822
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:27,089
input form like Google forms.

1823
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,260
So they would get a email
with a link to the Typeform

1824
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,190
or actually just a link after the checkout

1825
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,936
and they could upload their photos.

1826
00:57:33,936 --> 00:57:38,370
So enter the email, upload
the photos and I launched it,

1827
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:39,750
and I was like, here first sale,

1828
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,282
so it's October 2022.

1829
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:45,480
And I think within the
first 24 hours was like,

1830
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,900
I'm not sure it was a thousand
customers or something.

1831
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,329
But the problem was I didn't
have code to automate this.

1832
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:52,710
So I had to do manually.

1833
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,820
So the first few hundred,

1834
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,450
I just literally took
their photos, train them,

1835
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:59,579
and then I would generate
the photos with the prompts,

1836
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:00,871
and I had this text file with the prompts,

1837
00:58:00,871 --> 00:58:02,339
and I would do everything manually.

1838
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,680
And this quickly became way too much.

1839
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:05,969
But that's another constraint.

1840
00:58:05,969 --> 00:58:09,659
I was forced to code something
up that would do that.

1841
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:11,759
And that was essentially making it

1842
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,840
into a real website, right?

1843
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,767
- So at first it was the Typeform

1844
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:15,389
and they uploaded through the Typeform.

1845
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:17,489
- [Pieter] Stripe checkout platform, yeah.

1846
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,349
- And then you were like,
that image is downloaded.

1847
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:20,777
Did you write a script
to export downloaded?

1848
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,559
- No, it downloaded the images myself.

1849
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,730
It was a zip file, to
unzipped the zip file.

1850
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,590
- Literally, and you unzipped it.

1851
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,423
One by one.
- Yes.

1852
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:29,099
No, because you know, do
things that don't scale.

1853
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:30,299
Paul Graham says, right?

1854
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:32,182
And then I would train,

1855
00:58:32,182 --> 00:58:33,206
and I would email them the photos,

1856
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:36,264
I think from my personal email say,

1857
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:37,679
"Here's your avatars."

1858
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:38,512
And they liked it.

1859
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:40,590
They were like, "Wow, it's amazing."

1860
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,557
- You emailed them with
your personal email.

1861
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:44,208
- So I didn't have an
email address on this-

1862
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,659
- Yeah.
- Domain.

1863
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:47,184
- And this is like a hundred people.

1864
00:58:47,184 --> 00:58:50,730
- Yeah, and then you
know who signed up like,

1865
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,559
man, I cannot say it,
but really famous people,

1866
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,299
like really, really billionaires,

1867
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,749
famous tech billionaires did it.

1868
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:57,119
And I was like, "Wow, this is crazy."

1869
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,250
And I was like so scared to mess them.

1870
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,239
So I said, "Thanks so
much for using my sites."

1871
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,010
And he's like, "Yeah,
amazing app. Great work."

1872
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,500
So I was like, this is
different than normal reaction.

1873
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,900
- It's Bill Gates isn't, it?

1874
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:12,840
- Cannot say anything.
(Lex laughs)

1875
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,747
- Just like shirtless picks.
- GDPR like privacy.

1876
00:59:14,746 --> 00:59:16,559
- Right, right.
- European regulation.

1877
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,239
- Right.
- Cannot share anything.

1878
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,652
I was like, wow.

1879
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,349
But this shows like...

1880
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:23,182
So you make something

1881
00:59:23,182 --> 00:59:24,599
and then if it takes off very fast,

1882
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:25,739
you're like, it's validated.

1883
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:29,069
You're like, here's something
that people really want.

1884
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:30,450
But then also thought, this is a hype,

1885
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:31,949
this is gonna die down very fast,

1886
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:34,559
and it did because it's too cheesy.

1887
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:36,029
- But you had to automate the whole thing.

1888
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,230
How'd you automate it?

1889
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,059
So what's the AI component?

1890
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:41,009
How hard was that to figure out?

1891
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,974
- Okay, so that's actually in
many ways the easiest thing,

1892
00:59:43,974 --> 00:59:45,870
'cause there is all these
platforms already back then.

1893
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:49,322
There was platforms for
fine tune, Stable Diffusion.

1894
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:51,719
Now I use Replicate,

1895
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,519
back then I use different platforms,

1896
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:55,740
which was funny 'cause that platform

1897
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,750
when this thing took off, I would tweet,

1898
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,309
'cause I tweet always like how much money

1899
00:59:59,309 --> 01:00:00,333
these websites make.

1900
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:03,224
You call it vendor, right?

1901
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,219
The platform that did the GPUs,

1902
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:08,639
they increased their price
for training from $3 to $20.

1903
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,039
After they saw that I
was making so much money.

1904
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:12,329
So immediately my profit is gone,

1905
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,549
'cause I was selling them for $30

1906
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:17,039
and I was in a Slack with them
like saying, "What is this?"

1907
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,960
Can you just put it back to $3?

1908
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,369
They say, "Yeah, maybe in the future,

1909
01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:21,210
we're looking at it right now."

1910
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,166
I'm like, "What are you talking about?"

1911
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:23,880
You just took all my money,

1912
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,713
and they're smart.

1913
01:00:24,713 --> 01:00:25,650
- Well, they're not that smart

1914
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:30,240
because like you also
have a large platform

1915
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:31,279
and a lot of people respect you.

1916
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,940
So you can literally
come out and say that.

1917
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,740
- I think it's like kind of dirty

1918
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,329
to cancel a company or something.

1919
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:38,819
I prefer just bringing
my business elsewhere.

1920
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:39,653
But there was no elsewhere-

1921
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:40,485
- Right.
- Back then.

1922
01:00:40,485 --> 01:00:41,429
- [Lex] Right.

1923
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,899
- So I started talking to
other AI model, ML platforms.

1924
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,947
So Replicate was one of those platforms.

1925
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:49,027
And I started DMing, the CEO say,

1926
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:51,000
"Can you please create,"

1927
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,840
it's called Dream Booth,

1928
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,760
this fine tuning of yourself.

1929
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,773
Can you add this to your site?

1930
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:57,210
'Cause I need this, 'cause
I'm being price guard.

1931
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,820
And he said "No, because
it takes too long to run.

1932
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,750
It takes half an hour to run,

1933
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,070
and we don't have the GPUs for it."

1934
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,059
I said, "Please, please, please,

1935
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,536
and then after a week he said,

1936
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,869
"We're doing it, we're launching this."

1937
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,119
And then this company became,

1938
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,250
it was like not very famous company.

1939
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,090
It became very famous with this stuff,

1940
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,039
'cause suddenly everybody was like,

1941
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:16,590
oh, we can build similar
apps like avatar apps.

1942
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,090
And everybody started building avatar apps

1943
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,789
and everybody started
using Replicate for it.

1944
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:21,902
And it was from these early DMs

1945
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:23,579
with like the CEO, like Ben Firshman.

1946
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,110
Very nice guy.

1947
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,543
And he was like, they never prized media.

1948
01:01:27,543 --> 01:01:28,680
They never treated me bad.

1949
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:30,389
They always been very nice.

1950
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:31,799
It's a very cool company.

1951
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,980
So you can run any AI model, LLMs,

1952
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,030
you can run on here.

1953
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,680
- And you can scale?

1954
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:39,029
- Yes, they scale, yeah, yeah.

1955
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,170
And I mean you can do now,

1956
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,090
you can click on the model
and just run it already.

1957
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,260
It's like super easy.

1958
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,900
You log in with GitHub.
- That's great.

1959
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,220
- And by running it on the website,

1960
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:48,659
then you can automate with the API,

1961
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:50,579
you can make a website
that runs the model.

1962
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:52,619
- Generate images, generate
text, generate videos,

1963
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:53,730
generate music, generate speech.

1964
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,800
- Video.
- Fine tune models.

1965
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,633
- They do anything, yeah.

1966
01:01:56,632 --> 01:01:58,049
It's a very cool company.

1967
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:58,890
- Nice.

1968
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:01,079
And you're like growing
with them, essentially.

1969
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:02,130
They grew because of you,

1970
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,780
because it's like a big use case.

1971
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,615
- Yeah, the website even looks weird now.

1972
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:09,419
It started as a machine learning platform

1973
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,338
that was like, I didn't
even understand what it did.

1974
01:02:11,338 --> 01:02:13,952
It was just too ML.

1975
01:02:13,952 --> 01:02:15,869
You would understand 'cause
you're in the ML world.

1976
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:17,639
I wouldn't understand
- Now it's newb friendly.

1977
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:18,487
- Yeah, exactly.

1978
01:02:18,487 --> 01:02:19,320
(Lex laughs)

1979
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,847
And I didn't know how it worked

1980
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:23,053
but I knew that they could
probably do this and they did it.

1981
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:25,949
They built the models and now
I use them for everything.

1982
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:30,589
And we trainedlike, I
think now 36,000 models,

1983
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,309
36,000 people already.

1984
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:34,170
- But is there some tricks to fine tuning

1985
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,353
to like the collection of
photos that are provided?

1986
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:37,751
- Yes.
- Like how do you?

1987
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:39,555
- Yes, man, there's so many hacks.

1988
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:40,387
- The hacks.
- Yeah,

1989
01:02:40,387 --> 01:02:42,226
it's like 100 hacks to make it work.

1990
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:43,500
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

1991
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,900
- It get my secrets now.
- Well, not the secrets,

1992
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,430
but the more like,

1993
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,019
insights maybe about the human face

1994
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:50,219
and the human body.

1995
01:02:50,219 --> 01:02:52,532
What kind of stuff get messed up a lot?

1996
01:02:53,789 --> 01:02:55,259
- I think people, well man, as a living,

1997
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,860
people don't know how they look.

1998
01:02:57,782 --> 01:02:58,860
- [Lex] Yeah.

1999
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,970
- They generate photos of themselves

2000
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:01,393
and then they say, "Ah,
it doesn't look like me."

2001
01:03:01,393 --> 01:03:02,226
- [Lex] Yeah.

2002
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,730
- You can check the training photos.

2003
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,809
It does look like you.
- Yeah.

2004
01:03:06,809 --> 01:03:08,007
- But you don't know how you look.

2005
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:11,340
So there's a face dysmorphia of yourself

2006
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,840
that you have known idea how you look.

2007
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,680
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

2008
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,199
I mean I've got to one of
the least pleasant activities

2009
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:19,169
in my existence is having
to listen to my voice

2010
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,400
and look on my face.

2011
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,722
So I get to like really,

2012
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:25,680
really have to sort of

2013
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:28,739
come into terms with the
reality of how I look

2014
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,567
and how I sound.
- Man, everybody.

2015
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:31,889
- But people often don't,

2016
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:32,722
right?
- Really?

2017
01:03:32,722 --> 01:03:35,639
- You have a distorted view perspective.

2018
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:38,699
- I know that like if
I would make a selfie

2019
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:40,769
how I think I look that, that's nice.

2020
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:42,420
Other people think that's not nice.

2021
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,440
But then they make a photo of me,

2022
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,490
I'm like that's super ugly.

2023
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:45,446
But then they're like,
no, that's how you look.

2024
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,800
And you look nice.

2025
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,461
So how other people see you is nice.

2026
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:52,599
So you need to ask other
people to choose your photos.

2027
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:53,639
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2028
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:54,472
- You shouldn't choose them yourself

2029
01:03:54,472 --> 01:03:56,639
'cause you don't know how you look.

2030
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:58,079
- Yeah, you don't know
what makes you interesting,

2031
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,536
what makes you attractive
or all this kind of stuff.

2032
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:00,840
- Yeah, exactly.
- And a lot of us,

2033
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,970
this is dark aspect of psychology.

2034
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:06,419
We focus on some small flaws.
- Yeah.

2035
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,139
- This is why I hate plastic
surgery, for example.

2036
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:09,599
- Yeah.
- People try to remove

2037
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:10,920
the flaws when the flaws are the thing

2038
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,539
that makes you interesting and attractive.

2039
01:04:12,539 --> 01:04:15,029
- I learned from the
hammerhead shark eyes this,

2040
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,070
the stuff about you
that looks ugly to you.

2041
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,230
And it's probably what makes you,

2042
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,150
original makes you nice and
people like it about you.

2043
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:21,983
- [Lex] Yeah.

2044
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,490
- And it's not like, oh my god.

2045
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:24,322
And people notice it.

2046
01:04:24,322 --> 01:04:26,819
People notice your hammerhead eyes.

2047
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,345
But it's like, that's me, that's my face.

2048
01:04:28,344 --> 01:04:29,549
I love myself.

2049
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:30,383
And that's confidence,

2050
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:31,379
and confidence is attractive.

2051
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,700
- Yes.
- Right?

2052
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:33,869
- Confidence is attractive.

2053
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:36,179
But yes, understanding
what makes you beautiful.

2054
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:38,339
It's the breaking of
symmetry makes you beautiful.

2055
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,120
It's the breaking of the average
face makes you beautiful.

2056
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:42,952
All that.

2057
01:04:42,952 --> 01:04:44,519
- Yeah.
- And obviously

2058
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:45,992
different from men and
women, a different age.

2059
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:47,309
It's all this kind of stuff.
- Yeah, 100%.

2060
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:50,730
- But underneath it all the
personality, all of that.

2061
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:54,179
When the face comes alive,

2062
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:56,190
that also is the thing
that makes you beautiful.

2063
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,023
- Yeah.
- But anyway,

2064
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:58,650
you have to figure all that out with AI.

2065
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:00,740
- Yeah, one thing that worked was like

2066
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,619
people would upload full
body photos themselves.

2067
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:05,697
So I would crop the face, right?

2068
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:07,050
And then the model knew better

2069
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,210
that we're training mostly the face here.

2070
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,610
But then I started losing
resemblance of the body,

2071
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,646
'cause some people are skinny,

2072
01:05:12,646 --> 01:05:14,130
some people are muscular, whatever.

2073
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,930
So you want to have that too.

2074
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:18,989
So now I mix full body in the
training with face photos,

2075
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:22,033
face crops, and it's all automatic.

2076
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:23,519
And I know that other people,

2077
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,400
they use again AI models to detect like

2078
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,650
what are the best photos
in this training set?

2079
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,910
And then train on those.

2080
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:31,710
But it's all about training data

2081
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,960
and it's with everything in AI.

2082
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,525
How good your training data is,

2083
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:37,919
is in many ways more important than

2084
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,269
how many steps you train for like

2085
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,469
how many months or
whatever with these GPUs.

2086
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:43,702
The goals.

2087
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:45,019
- Do you have any guidelines for people

2088
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:46,590
of how to get good data?

2089
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:48,750
How to give good data to fine tune on?

2090
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,550
- The photos should be diverse.

2091
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,830
So for example, if I only upload photos

2092
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:55,409
with a brown shirt or green shirts,

2093
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:58,710
the model will think that I'm
training the green shirts.

2094
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,110
So the things that are
the same every photo

2095
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:03,269
are the concepts that are trained.

2096
01:06:03,269 --> 01:06:06,400
What you want is your face to
be the concept that's trained

2097
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:10,079
and everything else to be
diverse, like different.

2098
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,000
- So diverse lighting as
well, diverse everything.

2099
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,702
- Yeah, outside, inside.

2100
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:15,360
But there's no, like, this is the problem.

2101
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,010
There's no like manual for this,

2102
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:18,150
and nobody knew.

2103
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:19,139
We were all just...

2104
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:19,972
Especially two years ago,

2105
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:22,199
we're all hacking,
trying to test anything.

2106
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:23,500
Anything you can think of.

2107
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,369
And it's frustrating.

2108
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:28,109
It's one of the most
frustrating and also fun

2109
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,300
and challenging things
to do because with AI,

2110
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,670
'cause it's a black box.

2111
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:35,358
And like Karpathy, I think says this.

2112
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,070
We don't really know how this thing works,

2113
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:39,269
but it does something.

2114
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:41,250
But nobody really knows why, right?

2115
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:44,043
We cannot look into the model of an LLM,

2116
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:45,420
like what is actually in there.

2117
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,242
We just know it's a 3D
matrix of numbers, right?

2118
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:52,649
So it's very frustrating,

2119
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,096
'cause some things you...

2120
01:06:54,096 --> 01:06:55,079
You think they're obvious

2121
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,079
that they will improve
things will make them worse.

2122
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,730
And there's so many
parameters you can tweak.

2123
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:04,230
So you're testing everything
to improve things.

2124
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,340
- I mean there's a whole field novel

2125
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:08,250
of mechanistic interpretability
that like studies

2126
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,659
that tries to figure out,

2127
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:10,739
tries to break things apart

2128
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:12,299
and understand how it works.

2129
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,880
But there's also the data side

2130
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,869
and the actual like
consumer facing product side

2131
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,940
of figuring out how you
get it to generate a thing

2132
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,550
that's beautiful or
interesting or naturalistic,

2133
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,570
all that kind of stuff.
- Yeah.

2134
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,130
- And you're like at the forefront

2135
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,579
of figuring that out about the human face.

2136
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:29,730
- Yeah.
- And humans really care about

2137
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:31,505
the human face.
- They're very vain.

2138
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,338
(Lex laughs)

2139
01:07:32,338 --> 01:07:33,958
- Like me, I want to look
good on your podcast-

2140
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:34,791
- Yeah.
- For example.

2141
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:36,000
- Yeah, for sure.

2142
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,920
- And then one of the things
I actually would love to

2143
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,119
like rigorously use Photo AI,

2144
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,609
because for the thumbnails,

2145
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,930
I take portraits of people.

2146
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:48,480
I don't a shit about photography.

2147
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,550
I basically used your
approach for photography.

2148
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,289
I like Google.

2149
01:07:52,289 --> 01:07:55,559
How do you take photographs?
- Yeah.

2150
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:56,969
- Camera, lighting.

2151
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:58,199
And also it's tough

2152
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,869
because maybe you could
speak to this also,

2153
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:04,826
but with photography, no offense, Danny,

2154
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:07,620
they're true artists, great photographers.

2155
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:10,920
But people take themselves
way too seriously.

2156
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,980
Think you need a whole lot of equipment.

2157
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,840
You definitely don't want one light,

2158
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,670
you need like five lights.

2159
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:19,350
- Man, I know this.

2160
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,740
- And you have to have like the lenses.

2161
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,569
And I talked to a guy,

2162
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:29,569
an expert of shaping the
sound in a room, okay?

2163
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:32,782
Because I was thinking,

2164
01:08:32,783 --> 01:08:35,190
I'm gonna do a podcast studio, whatever,

2165
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:37,741
I should probably treat,

2166
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:40,260
do a sound treatment on the room.

2167
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:43,320
And when he showed up
and analyzed the room,

2168
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,299
he thought everything I
was doing was horrible.

2169
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:48,630
And then that's when I
realized like, you know what?

2170
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,369
I don't need experts in my life.

2171
01:08:50,369 --> 01:08:52,028
- You kick him outta the house.

2172
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:53,093
- No, I didn't kick them.

2173
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,599
I mean, I said thank
you, thank you very much.

2174
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,465
- Thank you.

2175
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,297
Great tips, bye.

2176
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:59,449
- I just felt like there is...

2177
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,097
Focus on whatever the problems are.

2178
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:04,590
Use your own judgment,
use your own instincts.

2179
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:06,090
Don't listen to other people,

2180
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:07,590
and only consult other people

2181
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:09,000
when there's a specific problem.

2182
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,300
And you consult them, not to
offload the problem onto them,

2183
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,400
but to gain wisdom from their perspective.

2184
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,589
Even if their perspective is ultimately

2185
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:17,699
one you don't agree with,

2186
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:20,069
you're gonna gain wisdom from that.

2187
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:22,369
I ultimately come up
with like a PHP solution.

2188
01:09:23,636 --> 01:09:26,438
PHP and jQuery solution-
- PHP studio.

2189
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:27,270
- PHP studio.

2190
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,649
I have a little suitcase,

2191
01:09:28,649 --> 01:09:33,649
I use just the basic sort
of consumer type of stuff.

2192
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:36,510
One light, it's great.

2193
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,560
- Yeah, and look at you,

2194
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,963
you're like one of the
top podcasts in the world

2195
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:41,460
and you get millions
of views and it works.

2196
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,980
And the people that spend
so much money on optimizing

2197
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,869
for the best sound for the best studio,

2198
01:09:45,869 --> 01:09:47,609
they get like 300 views.

2199
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:48,479
So what is this about?

2200
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,269
This is about that
either you do really well

2201
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,340
or also that a lot of
these things don't matter.

2202
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:56,006
What matters is probably
the content of the podcast.

2203
01:09:56,006 --> 01:09:56,838
- [Lex] Yeah.

2204
01:09:56,838 --> 01:09:57,671
- You get the interesting guests

2205
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:58,799
- Focus on stuff that matters.

2206
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,230
- Yeah, and I think that's very common.

2207
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:03,000
They call it Gear Acquisition Syndrome.

2208
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,640
Guests, like people in
any industry do this,

2209
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,780
they just buy all the stuff.

2210
01:10:06,779 --> 01:10:07,673
There was a meme recently.

2211
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,868
What's the name for the
guy that buys all the stuff

2212
01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:12,168
before he even started
doing the hobby, right?

2213
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:14,092
Marketing.

2214
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:15,119
Marketing does that to people.

2215
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,529
They wanna buy this stuff.
- Yeah.

2216
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:18,603
- But like, man,

2217
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,800
you can make a Hollywood
movie on an iPhone.

2218
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,319
If the content is good enough,

2219
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:26,789
and it will probably be original

2220
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:29,073
because you would be
using an iPhone for it.

2221
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:32,369
- That said, so the
reason I brought that up

2222
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:33,393
with photography.

2223
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,239
There is wisdom from people

2224
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,399
and one of the things I realized,

2225
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:41,519
you probably also realized this,

2226
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,520
but how much power light
has to convey emotion.

2227
01:10:47,005 --> 01:10:49,529
Just take one light and move it around.

2228
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:50,699
See you're sitting in the darkness,

2229
01:10:50,699 --> 01:10:52,349
move it around your face.

2230
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,030
The different positions are having

2231
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:55,559
a second light potentially,

2232
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,330
you can play with how a person feels

2233
01:10:57,329 --> 01:10:58,720
just from a generic face.

2234
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,030
- Yeah.
- It's interesting.

2235
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:01,439
You can make people attractive,

2236
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:02,429
you can make 'em ugly,

2237
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,450
you can make them scary,

2238
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:05,189
you can make them lonely.

2239
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:06,022
All of this.
- Yeah.

2240
01:11:06,023 --> 01:11:09,180
- And so you kind of
start to realize this.

2241
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:12,240
And I would definitely love AI help

2242
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:16,170
in creating great portraits of people.

2243
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,000
- Guest photos, yeah.
- Guest photos, for example.

2244
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,800
That's a small use case.

2245
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,672
But for me,

2246
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,930
I suppose it's an important use case

2247
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,670
because I want people to look good

2248
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:30,779
but I also wanna capture who they are.

2249
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:32,103
Maybe my conception of who they are,

2250
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:33,690
what makes them beautiful.

2251
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,309
- Yeah.
- What makes their appearance

2252
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,570
powerful in some ways.

2253
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:39,210
Sometimes it's the eyes,
oftentimes it's the eyes,

2254
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,560
but there's certain features of the face

2255
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,210
can sometimes be really powerful.

2256
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:45,508
It's also kind of awkward for me to take.

2257
01:11:45,507 --> 01:11:47,069
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Photographs.

2258
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,529
So I'm not collecting enough.
- Yeah.

2259
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:51,489
- Photographs for myself to do it

2260
01:11:52,649 --> 01:11:54,029
with just those photographs.

2261
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:56,399
If I can load that off onto AI

2262
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,460
and then start to play with
lighting all that stuff.

2263
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,912
- Man, you should do,

2264
01:11:59,912 --> 01:12:01,047
and you should probably do it yourself.

2265
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,069
You can use Photo AI,

2266
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:04,049
but it's even more fun
if you do it yourself.

2267
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,730
So you train models,

2268
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:07,289
you can learn about like control nets.

2269
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,670
Control net is where, for example,

2270
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:09,989
your photos in your podcast are usually

2271
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:11,579
like from the angle, right?

2272
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:14,460
So you can create a control net face post

2273
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,539
that's always like this.

2274
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:17,460
So every model, every photo you generate

2275
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:20,489
uses this control net photos, for example.

2276
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:22,429
I think would be very fun for
you to try out that something.

2277
01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:24,030
- Do you play with lighting at all?

2278
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:25,359
Do you play with lighting,
with pose with the?

2279
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:27,210
- Man, actually, like this week

2280
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,189
or recently, there's
some new model came out

2281
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:32,429
that can adjust the light of any photo.

2282
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,829
But also AI image with Stable Diffusion.

2283
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:36,573
I think it's called Relight.

2284
01:12:38,557 --> 01:12:39,390
And it's amazing.

2285
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:43,769
You can upload kinda like a light map.

2286
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,140
So for example, red, purple, blue,

2287
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:47,789
and use the light map

2288
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:50,279
to change the light on
the photo you input.

2289
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:51,599
It's amazing.

2290
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,300
So there's for sure a
lot of stuff you can do.

2291
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,869
- What's your advice for people
in general on how to learn

2292
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,599
all this state-of-the-art
AI tools available?

2293
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,970
You mentioned the new models
coming out all the time.

2294
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:05,310
- Yeah.
- How do you pay attention?

2295
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,400
How do you stay on top of everything?

2296
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:10,175
- I think you need to join Twitter X.

2297
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:14,310
X is amazing now and the
whole AI industry is on X,

2298
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,170
and they're all like anime avatars.

2299
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,850
So (chuckles) it's funny,

2300
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,680
'cause my friends ask me this.

2301
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,630
Who should I follow to stay up to date?

2302
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,010
And I say go to X,

2303
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,440
and follow all the AI anime models

2304
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:28,049
that this person is following or follows.

2305
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,159
And I send them something URL,

2306
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:30,779
and they all start laughing
like, what is this?

2307
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:33,779
But they're real like
people hacking around in AI.

2308
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,012
They get hired by big
companies and they're on X,

2309
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:38,159
and most of 'em are anonymous.

2310
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:38,992
It's very funny.

2311
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:43,109
They use anime avatar, I don't,

2312
01:13:43,109 --> 01:13:44,880
but those people hack around

2313
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,609
and then they publish
what they're discovering.

2314
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:49,889
They talk about papers, for example.

2315
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:50,733
So yeah, definitely X.

2316
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:51,600
- It's great.

2317
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,440
I almost exclusively all the
people I follow are AI people.

2318
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:57,629
- Yeah, it's a good time now.

2319
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:02,520
- Well, but also just
brings happiness to my soul,

2320
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,150
'cause there's so much turmoil on Twitter.

2321
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:07,469
- Yeah, politics and stuff.

2322
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:08,880
- There's battles going on.

2323
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,079
It's like a war zone,

2324
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,989
and it's nice to just
go into this happy place

2325
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:14,699
to where people are building stuff.

2326
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:15,532
- Yeah, 100%.

2327
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:18,000
I like Twitter for that
most like building stuff,

2328
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,289
like seeing other.

2329
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,460
'Cause it inspires you to build

2330
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,850
and it's just fun to
see other people share

2331
01:14:23,850 --> 01:14:26,130
what they're discovering
and then you're like,

2332
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,329
okay, I'm gonna make something too.

2333
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,680
It's just super fun.

2334
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,990
And so if you wanna start going X

2335
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:32,909
and then I would go to Replicate,

2336
01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:34,949
and start trying to play with models.

2337
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,529
And when you have something that kind of,

2338
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:37,979
you manually enter stuff,

2339
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:39,359
you set the parameters,

2340
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:40,289
something that works,

2341
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:42,899
you can make an app
out of it or a website.

2342
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:45,509
- Can you speak a little
bit more to the process

2343
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:47,940
of it becoming better and
better and better Photo AI.

2344
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:49,022
- So I had this Photo AI,

2345
01:14:49,023 --> 01:14:49,855
and a lot of people using it.

2346
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,269
There was like a million

2347
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:53,700
or more photos a month being generated.

2348
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:56,550
And I discovered I was testing

2349
01:14:56,550 --> 01:14:58,820
parameters like increase the step count

2350
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:00,960
of generating a photo
or chasing the sampler,

2351
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,250
like a scheduler.

2352
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:04,020
You have DPM++2 Karras

2353
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,400
all these things I don't
know anything about,

2354
01:15:05,399 --> 01:15:07,619
but I know that you can choose
them and you generate image

2355
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:09,569
and they have different resulting images.

2356
01:15:09,569 --> 01:15:11,369
But I didn't know which one were better.

2357
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:13,109
So I would do it myself, test it.

2358
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,136
But then I was like, why
dot I test on these users?

2359
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,819
'Cause I have a million
photos generated anyway.

2360
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:19,380
So unlike 10% of the users,

2361
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,350
I would randomly test parameters,

2362
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,717
and then I would see if they would,

2363
01:15:23,716 --> 01:15:26,579
'cause you can favor the
photo or you can download it.

2364
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:29,880
I would measure if they
favorite or like the photo.

2365
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,529
And then I would AB test,

2366
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:33,572
and you test for significance and stuff,

2367
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:37,680
which parameters were were
better and which were worse?

2368
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,270
- So you start starting to figure out

2369
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:40,753
which models are actually working well.

2370
01:15:40,752 --> 01:15:42,269
- Exactly, and then if it's
significant enough data,

2371
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:45,330
you switch to that for the
whole, you know, all the users.

2372
01:15:45,329 --> 01:15:47,399
And so that was like the
breakthrough to make it better.

2373
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:49,676
Just use the users to improve themselves.

2374
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:51,779
And I tell them when they
sign up, we do sampling,

2375
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:54,149
we do testing on your
photos of random parameters,

2376
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,589
and that worked really well.

2377
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:56,670
I don't do a lot of testing anymore

2378
01:15:56,670 --> 01:15:57,960
because it's like, I kind of reached

2379
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,369
a diminishing point where it's like,

2380
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:00,269
it's kind of good,

2381
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:03,149
but there was a breakthrough, yeah.

2382
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:04,529
- So it's really about the parameters,

2383
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:07,739
the models that choose
and letting the users

2384
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:10,800
help do the search in the space of models

2385
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,020
and parameters for you.
- Yeah, yeah.

2386
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,450
But actually, so like Stable Diffusion,

2387
01:16:15,449 --> 01:16:17,909
I used 1.52, 2.0 came out

2388
01:16:17,909 --> 01:16:19,319
as Stable Diffusion Excel came out,

2389
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:21,539
all these new versions
and they're all worse.

2390
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:24,930
And so the core scene of
people are still using 1.5

2391
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,233
because it's also not like,
what do you call neutered?

2392
01:16:27,233 --> 01:16:30,480
They neutered to make it super like,

2393
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:32,039
with safety features and stuff.

2394
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:34,170
- Yeah.
- So most of the people

2395
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:36,149
are still on Stable Diffusion 1.5

2396
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:38,219
and meanwhile Stable Diffusion,

2397
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,119
the company went like, the CEO left.

2398
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:44,099
A lot of drama happened.
- Yeah.

2399
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,720
- Because they couldn't make money,

2400
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,940
and yeah, so it's very interesting,

2401
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:51,750
they gave us this open source
model that everybody uses.

2402
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,899
They raised like hundreds
of millions of dollars.

2403
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:55,859
They didn't make any money,

2404
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:56,692
there are not a lot.

2405
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:57,869
And they did amazing job.

2406
01:16:57,869 --> 01:17:00,369
And now everybody uses
open source model for free.

2407
01:17:02,489 --> 01:17:03,322
It's amazing.

2408
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:04,200
It's amazing.

2409
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:06,146
- You're not even using the
latest one, you're saying?

2410
01:17:06,146 --> 01:17:06,979
- No, and the strange thing is

2411
01:17:06,979 --> 01:17:08,549
that this company raised
hundreds of millions,

2412
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:10,750
but the people that are benefiting
from it are really small.

2413
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:13,289
People like me who make these small apps

2414
01:17:13,289 --> 01:17:14,579
that are using the model.

2415
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:16,829
And now they're starting to
charge money for the new models.

2416
01:17:16,829 --> 01:17:19,012
But the new models are
not so good for people.

2417
01:17:19,012 --> 01:17:20,239
They're not sell open source, right?

2418
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:24,179
- Yeah, it is interesting
because open source

2419
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,430
is so impactful in the AI space,

2420
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,650
but you wonder like what is
the business model behind that?

2421
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,619
But it's enabling this whole
ecosystem of companies that-

2422
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:32,489
- [Pieter] Yeah, yeah.

2423
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:33,322
- They're using the open source models.

2424
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:34,890
- So it's kinda like this frameworks,

2425
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:38,823
but then they didn't bribe
enough influence to use it,

2426
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,760
and they didn't charge
money for the platform.

2427
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,806
- Okay, so back to your
book and the ideas.

2428
01:17:44,806 --> 01:17:46,682
We didn't even get to the first step.

2429
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,090
Generating ideas, so you had notebook,

2430
01:17:51,090 --> 01:17:52,650
and you're filling it up.

2431
01:17:52,649 --> 01:17:54,712
How do you know when
an idea is a good one?

2432
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:58,529
You have this just flood of ideas.

2433
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:01,229
How do you pick the one that
you actually try to build?

2434
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:02,759
- Man, mostly you don't know.

2435
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:03,720
Mostly, I choose the ones

2436
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,430
that are most viable for me to build.

2437
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,220
I cannot build a space company now, right?

2438
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,820
It would be quite challenging.

2439
01:18:08,819 --> 01:18:09,664
But I can build something.

2440
01:18:09,664 --> 01:18:11,789
- Did you actually write
down like space company?

2441
01:18:11,789 --> 01:18:14,369
- No, I think asteroid
mining would be very cool.

2442
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:16,109
'Cause like you go to an asteroid,

2443
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:18,000
you take some stuff from
there, you bring it back,

2444
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,682
you sell it, you know.

2445
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,353
But then you need to do...

2446
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:23,460
And you can hire someone
to launch the thing.

2447
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,739
So all you need is like the
robot that goes to the asteroid,

2448
01:18:25,739 --> 01:18:28,019
and the robotic is interesting.

2449
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,220
I wanna also learn robotics.

2450
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,780
So maybe that could be.

2451
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:32,189
- I think both the asteroid mining

2452
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:33,899
and the robotics is-
- Yeah.

2453
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:34,732
- Together.

2454
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:39,630
- I feel like.

2455
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:41,203
- No, exactly, this is it.

2456
01:18:41,203 --> 01:18:43,319
- It says-
- We do this

2457
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:44,309
not because it's easy,

2458
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:45,840
but because we thought it would be easy.

2459
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,070
Exactly-
- Asteroid mining.

2460
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:48,971
- That's me with asteroid mining.

2461
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:50,579
Exactly.
(Lex laughs)

2462
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:51,689
That's why I should do this.

2463
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:53,096
- It's not nomadlist.com. (laughs)

2464
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,649
- No, it's not.
- It's asteroid mining.

2465
01:18:55,649 --> 01:18:57,389
You have to like build stuff.

2466
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:59,365
Gravity is really hard to overcome.

2467
01:18:59,365 --> 01:19:00,779
- Yeah, but it seems...

2468
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,279
Man, I sound like idiots, probably not.

2469
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,929
But it sounds quite approachable,

2470
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:04,762
relatively approachable.

2471
01:19:04,762 --> 01:19:06,090
You don't have to build a rocket issue.

2472
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:07,710
- Oh, you use something like
SpaceX to get out the space.

2473
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,439
- Yeah, you hire SpaceX
to send your, you know,

2474
01:19:10,439 --> 01:19:12,059
this dog robot or whatever.

2475
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:13,860
- So is there actually existing notebook

2476
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:15,179
where you wrote down asteroid mining?

2477
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,643
- No, back then I used Trello.

2478
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:17,520
- Trello.
- Yeah.

2479
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,770
But now I don't really, I used Telegram.

2480
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:21,090
I rather than like saved messages

2481
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,739
and I have like idea, I write it down.

2482
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:24,014
- You type to yourself on Telegram?

2483
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,311
- 'Cause you use WhatsApp, right?

2484
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:27,573
I think, so you have messages to yourself,

2485
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:28,948
thing also, yeah, it's like a notepad.

2486
01:19:28,948 --> 01:19:29,920
- So you're talking to
yourself on Telegram.

2487
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,369
- Yeah, you use like a
Notepad, to not forget stuff.

2488
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:33,479
And then I pin it.

2489
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:35,459
- I love how like you're not using

2490
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,890
super complicated systems or whatever.

2491
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:39,030
People use Obsidian now.

2492
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:40,800
There's a lot of these-

2493
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,132
- A notion where you have
systems for note taking.

2494
01:19:45,606 --> 01:19:47,699
Your notepad, your notepad.exe guy.

2495
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,929
If you're those user-
- Yeah.

2496
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:51,123
Man, I saw some YouTubers doing this.

2497
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:53,759
There's a lot of these
productivity gurus also.

2498
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,579
And they do this whole iPad with a pencil.

2499
01:19:56,579 --> 01:19:58,619
And then I also had an iPad
and I also got the pencil

2500
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:01,220
and I got this app where
you can like draw on paper.

2501
01:20:03,046 --> 01:20:04,769
Like a calendar.
- Yeah.

2502
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:07,557
- People's students uses and
you do coloring and stuff.

2503
01:20:07,556 --> 01:20:09,364
And I'm like, dude, I did this for a week.

2504
01:20:09,364 --> 01:20:10,342
And then I'm like, what
am I doing in my life?

2505
01:20:10,342 --> 01:20:12,989
I could just write it
as a message to myself

2506
01:20:12,989 --> 01:20:14,550
and it's good enough.

2507
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:17,130
- Speaking of ideas, you
shared a tweet explaining

2508
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,670
why the first idea sometimes
might be a brilliant idea.

2509
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:23,163
The reason for this you think
is the first idea submerges

2510
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:24,959
from your subconscious,

2511
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,970
and was actually boiling
your brain for weeks, months,

2512
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:28,980
sometimes years in the background.

2513
01:20:28,979 --> 01:20:31,559
The eight hours of
thinking can never compete

2514
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,720
with a perpetual
subconscious background job.

2515
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,850
So this is the idea that
if you think about an idea

2516
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,240
for eight hours versus like the first idea

2517
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:38,559
that pops into your mind.

2518
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,570
- Yeah.
- And sometimes

2519
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,670
there is subconscious,

2520
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:45,180
like stuff that you've been
thinking about for many years.

2521
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:46,012
That's really interesting.

2522
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:46,845
- Yeah, I mean like emerges.

2523
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:49,139
I wrote it wrong because
I'm not native English,

2524
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,390
but it emerges from your
subconscious, right?

2525
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:53,610
It comes from the like a water,

2526
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:55,649
your subconscious in here, it's boiling,

2527
01:20:55,649 --> 01:20:58,027
and then when it's ready it's like ding.

2528
01:20:58,027 --> 01:20:59,609
It's like a microwave comes out

2529
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:01,199
and there you have your idea.

2530
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:02,579
- You think you have ideas like that?

2531
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:04,079
- Yeah, all the time, 100%.

2532
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:05,699
- It's just stuff that's been like there.

2533
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:06,626
- Yes.
- Yeah.

2534
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:09,030
- And also, it comes up and I bring it,

2535
01:21:09,029 --> 01:21:09,929
I send it back,

2536
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:11,520
like send it back to the kitchen-

2537
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,353
- Not ready yet.
- To boil more.

2538
01:21:12,353 --> 01:21:13,590
- Yeah.
- And it's like

2539
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:16,079
a soup of ideas that's cooking.

2540
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:16,912
It's 100%.

2541
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:17,849
This is how my brain works,

2542
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:18,870
and I think most people.

2543
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:20,579
- But it's also about the timing.

2544
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:21,689
Sometimes you have to send it back,

2545
01:21:21,689 --> 01:21:22,949
not just because you're not ready,

2546
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,599
but the world is not ready.

2547
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,567
- Yeah, so many times,

2548
01:21:25,567 --> 01:21:28,899
startup founders are too
early with their idea.

2549
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:30,119
Yeah, 100%.

2550
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,769
- Robotics is an interesting one for that

2551
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,480
because like there's been a lot

2552
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:34,886
of robotics companies that failed.

2553
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:35,719
- [Pieter] Yeah.

2554
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,423
- Because it's been
very difficult to build,

2555
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:38,729
a robotics company, make money,

2556
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:39,809
'cause there's the manufacturing,

2557
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,160
like the cost of everything.

2558
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,170
The intelligence of the robot is enough,

2559
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,569
is not sufficient to create

2560
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:47,219
a compelling enough product from

2561
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:49,186
which to make money.

2562
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:51,389
So there's this long line
of robotics companies

2563
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:53,970
that have tried, they had
big dreams and they failed.

2564
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,530
- Yeah, like Boston Dynamics.

2565
01:21:55,529 --> 01:21:56,519
I still don't know what they're doing,

2566
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,020
but they always upload YouTube videos,

2567
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,250
and it's amazing.

2568
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,356
But I feel like a lot of
these companies don't have a,

2569
01:22:01,356 --> 01:22:04,050
it's like a solution looking
for a problem for now.

2570
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,672
Military obviously use this,

2571
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,929
do I need like a robotic
dog now for my house?

2572
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:10,762
I don't know.

2573
01:22:10,762 --> 01:22:13,559
It's fun, but it doesn't
really solve anything yet.

2574
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,960
I feel the same kinda VR,
like it's really cool.

2575
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,159
Apple Vision Pro is very cool.

2576
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:19,920
It doesn't really solve
something for me yet.

2577
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,949
And that's kind of the tech
looking for a solution, right?

2578
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:24,059
But one day, will.

2579
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:25,260
- When the personal computer,

2580
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:26,430
when the Mac came along,

2581
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:29,909
there's a big switch that happened.

2582
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:31,889
It somehow captivated
everybody's imagination

2583
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,292
and like the application, the killer apps

2584
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:37,950
became apparent, you
can type in a computer.

2585
01:22:37,949 --> 01:22:39,809
- But take became
apparent like immediately.

2586
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,000
Back then they also had
like this thing where like,

2587
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,829
we don't need these computers.

2588
01:22:43,829 --> 01:22:44,853
They're like a hype.

2589
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,270
And it also went like in kinda like waves.

2590
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,690
- Yeah, yeah, but the hype is the thing

2591
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,849
that allowed the thing to
proliferate sufficiently

2592
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:55,980
to where people's minds would start

2593
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:56,919
opening up to it a little bit.

2594
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,199
- Yeah.
- The possibility of it.

2595
01:22:58,199 --> 01:22:59,939
Right now, for example, with the robotics,

2596
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:03,629
there's very few robots
in the homes of people.

2597
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:04,619
- Exactly, yeah.

2598
01:23:04,619 --> 01:23:06,407
- The robots that are Roombas,

2599
01:23:06,408 --> 01:23:10,950
so the vacuum cleaners
or they're Amazon Alexa.

2600
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:12,149
- Yeah, or dishwasher.

2601
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:13,619
I mean it's essentially a robot.

2602
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:15,608
- Yes, but the intelligence
is very limited.

2603
01:23:15,608 --> 01:23:16,440
- Yeah.

2604
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,269
- I guess is one way we
can summarize all of them.

2605
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:20,670
Except Alexa, which is pretty intelligent,

2606
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:25,592
but is limited with the kind
of ways it interacts with you.

2607
01:23:26,694 --> 01:23:29,130
That's just one example.
- Yeah.

2608
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,500
- I sometimes think about that as like,

2609
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,810
if some people in this world were

2610
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:36,610
kind of born in the
whole existence is like

2611
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,889
they were meant to build the thing.

2612
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,509
- Yeah.

2613
01:23:42,509 --> 01:23:46,021
- I think I sometimes wonder
like what I was meant to do.

2614
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,519
Because you have these
plans for your life,

2615
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,053
you have these dreams.

2616
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,420
- I think you're meant to build robots.

2617
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,436
- Okay, me personally.

2618
01:23:52,436 --> 01:23:53,269
(Pieter and Lex laughs)

2619
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,693
Maybe, maybe.

2620
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:58,439
That's a sense of habit,

2621
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:00,370
but it could be other things.

2622
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:02,310
It could hilariously not be the thing

2623
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:05,730
I was meant to be is to talk to people.

2624
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:06,809
- Yeah.
- Which is weird,

2625
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,487
because I always was anxious
about talking to people.

2626
01:24:08,487 --> 01:24:10,710
It's like a-
- Really?

2627
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:11,542
- Yeah, I'm scared of this.

2628
01:24:11,542 --> 01:24:14,279
I was scared is (laughs) yeah, exactly.

2629
01:24:14,279 --> 01:24:15,112
- I'm scared of you as well.

2630
01:24:15,113 --> 01:24:15,945
(Lex laughs)

2631
01:24:15,945 --> 01:24:17,159
- It's just anxiety throughout,

2632
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:18,359
social interaction in general.

2633
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:21,539
I'm an introvert that hides
from the world, so yeah.

2634
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:22,979
It's really strange.

2635
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:24,539
- Yeah, but that's also kinda life.

2636
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:25,619
Life brings you to,

2637
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:30,149
it's very hard to super
intently kind of choose

2638
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,095
what you're gonna do with your life.

2639
01:24:31,095 --> 01:24:32,969
It's more like surfing.

2640
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:33,869
You're surfing the waves.

2641
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:35,159
You go in the ocean,

2642
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:36,409
you see where you end up.

2643
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:39,000
- Yeah, yeah.

2644
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,489
And there's universe has
a kind of sense of humor.

2645
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:42,929
- [Pieter] Yeah.

2646
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,829
- I guess you have to just,

2647
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:46,170
yeah, allow yourself to be
carried away by the ways.

2648
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,301
Yeah.
- Exactly, yeah, yeah.

2649
01:24:48,301 --> 01:24:50,160
- Have you felt that way in your life?

2650
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,090
- Yeah, all the time.

2651
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah, I think that's the
best way to live your life.

2652
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,560
- So allow whatever to happen.

2653
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,570
Do you know what you're
doing in the next few years?

2654
01:24:57,569 --> 01:24:59,130
Is it possible that it'll be completely,

2655
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:01,319
like changed?
- Possibly.

2656
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:02,429
I think relationships,

2657
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,480
you wanna hold relationships, right?

2658
01:25:03,479 --> 01:25:04,349
You wanna hold your girlfriend,

2659
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,400
you wanna become wife and all this stuff.

2660
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:10,679
I think you should stay open to where,

2661
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,693
like for example, where you wanna live.

2662
01:25:11,693 --> 01:25:12,630
I don't know,

2663
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:15,390
we don't know where we
wanna live, for example.

2664
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:17,180
That's something that
will figure itself out.

2665
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,559
It will crystallize where

2666
01:25:18,559 --> 01:25:22,199
you will get sent by
the waves to somewhere

2667
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:24,300
where you only live, for
example, what you're gonna do.

2668
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,670
I think that's a really
good way to live your life.

2669
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,500
I think most stress comes
from trying to control,

2670
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:29,600
like hold things...

2671
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,332
It's kind of Buddhist.

2672
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:35,309
You need to like lose
control, let it loose.

2673
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:36,180
And things will happen.

2674
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:38,100
When you do mushrooms, when you do drugs,

2675
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,390
like psychedelic drugs.

2676
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:40,950
The people that start,

2677
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:43,006
that are like control
freaks get bad trips, right?

2678
01:25:43,006 --> 01:25:44,939
'Cause you need to let go.

2679
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:46,639
I'm pretty control freak actually.

2680
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:50,119
When I did mushrooms when I was 17,

2681
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:51,029
it was very good.

2682
01:25:51,029 --> 01:25:51,929
And then at the end it wasn't so good,

2683
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,070
'cause I tried to control it was like,

2684
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:54,869
ah, now it's going too much.

2685
01:25:54,869 --> 01:25:56,099
Let's stop.

2686
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,030
Bro, you can't stop it.

2687
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:58,902
You need to go through with it.

2688
01:26:00,824 --> 01:26:01,979
And I think it's a good metaphor for life.

2689
01:26:01,979 --> 01:26:05,519
I think that's very tranquil
way to lead your life.

2690
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,300
- Yeah, actually when I took Ayahuasca,

2691
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:13,079
that lesson is deeply within me already

2692
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:14,489
that you can't control anything.

2693
01:26:14,489 --> 01:26:15,322
- [Pieter] Yes.

2694
01:26:15,323 --> 01:26:17,970
- I think I probably learned
that the most in jiu-jitsu.

2695
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:20,670
So just let go and relax.
- Yeah.

2696
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:22,470
- And that's why I had just
an incredible experience.

2697
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:24,420
There's like literally no negative aspect

2698
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,069
of my Ayahuasca experience

2699
01:26:26,069 --> 01:26:28,170
or any psychedelics I've ever had.

2700
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:29,640
Some of that could be with my biology

2701
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:30,690
and my genetics, whatever.

2702
01:26:30,689 --> 01:26:33,269
But some of it was just
not trying to control.

2703
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:34,530
- Yeah.
- Just surf the wave.

2704
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:35,362
- For sure.

2705
01:26:35,363 --> 01:26:37,613
I think most stress in life
comes from trying to control.

2706
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,890
- So once you have the idea-
- Yeah.

2707
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:42,240
- Step two, build.

2708
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,829
How do you think about building

2709
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:45,269
the thing once you have the idea?

2710
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:46,170
- I think you should build

2711
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,670
with the technology that you know.

2712
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,670
So for example, Nomad List,

2713
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:51,989
which is like this website I made

2714
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:53,579
to figure out the best cities to live

2715
01:26:53,579 --> 01:26:55,412
and work as digital nomad.

2716
01:26:56,369 --> 01:26:57,202
It wasn't a website,

2717
01:26:57,203 --> 01:26:59,820
it launched as a Google spreadsheets.

2718
01:26:59,819 --> 01:27:01,319
So it was a public Google spreadsheet.

2719
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:02,670
Anybody could edit.

2720
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:04,170
And I was like, I'm collecting cities

2721
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:05,640
where we can live with as nomads,

2722
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,110
with the internet speeds,

2723
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:10,409
the cost of living, other stuff.

2724
01:27:10,409 --> 01:27:11,460
And I tweeted it,

2725
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,079
and back then I didn't
have a lot of followers.

2726
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:15,479
I had like a few thousand
followers or something.

2727
01:27:15,479 --> 01:27:18,059
And I went like viral for
my skill viral back then,

2728
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:19,765
you know, which was like five retweets.

2729
01:27:19,765 --> 01:27:22,079
And a lot of people started editing it.

2730
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:24,029
And there was like hundreds
of cities in this list,

2731
01:27:24,029 --> 01:27:25,889
from all over the world with all the data.

2732
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:26,850
It was very crowdsourced.

2733
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:29,220
And then I made that into a website.

2734
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,887
So figuring out like what technology

2735
01:27:31,886 --> 01:27:33,599
you can use that you already know.

2736
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,310
So if you cannot code,
you can use a spreadsheet.

2737
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:38,640
If you cannot use a
spreadsheet, like whatever,

2738
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,800
you can always use a, for example,

2739
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,239
a website generator like Wix

2740
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,309
or something or Squarespace, right?

2741
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:46,320
You don't need to code to build a startup.

2742
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:49,619
All you need is idea for a product.

2743
01:27:49,619 --> 01:27:52,769
Build something like a
landing page or something.

2744
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:55,290
Put a Stripe button on
there and then make it.

2745
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:56,489
And if you can code,

2746
01:27:56,489 --> 01:27:58,466
use the language that you already know

2747
01:27:58,466 --> 01:27:59,579
and start coding with that

2748
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:01,500
and see how far you can get.

2749
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,449
You can always rewrite the code later.

2750
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:04,744
The tech stack is not actually,

2751
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:06,569
it's not the most important of a business

2752
01:28:06,569 --> 01:28:07,558
when you're starting on a business.

2753
01:28:07,559 --> 01:28:09,180
The important thing is that you validate

2754
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,012
that there's a market,

2755
01:28:10,012 --> 01:28:12,023
that there's a product
that people wanna pay for.

2756
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:14,247
So use whatever you can use.

2757
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,329
And if you cannot code,

2758
01:28:15,329 --> 01:28:20,069
use spreadsheets, landing
page generators, whatever.

2759
01:28:20,069 --> 01:28:22,719
- Yeah, and the crowdsourcing
element is fascinating.

2760
01:28:24,449 --> 01:28:26,670
It's cool, it's cool when a
lot of people start using it.

2761
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:29,421
You get to learn so fast.
- Yeah.

2762
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:33,000
- I've actually did the spreadsheet thing.

2763
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,600
You share a spreadsheet publicly

2764
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:37,469
and I made it editable.

2765
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,302
- Yeah.
- It's so cool.

2766
01:28:38,302 --> 01:28:39,750
- [Pieter] Interesting
things start happening.

2767
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,970
- Yeah, I did it for like a workout thing,

2768
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,319
'cause I was doing a large

2769
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:44,540
amount of pushups and pull ups every day.

2770
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,003
- Yeah, I remember this man, yeah.

2771
01:28:46,002 --> 01:28:50,219
- (laugh) And well, I had
Google Sheets is pretty limited

2772
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:52,020
and that everything is allowed.

2773
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,300
So people could just
write anything in any cell

2774
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,820
and they can create new sheets.

2775
01:28:56,819 --> 01:28:58,139
- Yeah.
- New tabs.

2776
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:00,180
And it just exploded.

2777
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,936
And one of the things

2778
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,779
that I really enjoyed is
there's very few trolls

2779
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:10,529
because actually other people
would delete the trolls.

2780
01:29:10,529 --> 01:29:11,699
There would be like this weird war-

2781
01:29:11,699 --> 01:29:13,829
- Army, yeah.
- Of like.

2782
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:15,840
They want like to protect the thing.

2783
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,600
It's an immune system that's
inherent to the thing.

2784
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,250
- It comes to society.
- Yeah.

2785
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,130
- In the spreadsheets.

2786
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,569
- And then there's the outcast

2787
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:23,309
who go to the bottom of the spreadsheet

2788
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,990
and they would try to hide messages,

2789
01:29:24,989 --> 01:29:26,250
and they like, I don't wanna be

2790
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:28,079
with the cool kids up at
the top of the spreadsheet,

2791
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:29,471
so I'm gonna at the bottom.
- Self-harmonizing.

2792
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:30,447
- Yes.
- It's insane.

2793
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:31,280
- It's fast.

2794
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,460
I mean, but that kind of

2795
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,859
crowdsourcing element is really powerful.

2796
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:38,139
And if you can create
a product that use that

2797
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:41,789
to his benefit, that's really nice.

2798
01:29:41,789 --> 01:29:43,710
Any kind of voting system,
any kind of rating system

2799
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:44,710
for A and B testing is really-

2800
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,680
- Yeah.
- Really, really fascinating.

2801
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,020
So anyway, so Nomad List is great.

2802
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,487
I would love for you to talk about that.

2803
01:29:50,487 --> 01:29:53,619
But one sort of way to talk about it is

2804
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:58,380
through you building Hoodmaps.

2805
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:00,569
- Yeah.
- So you did an awesome thing,

2806
01:30:00,569 --> 01:30:04,949
which is document yourself
building the thing

2807
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:06,929
and doing so in just a handful of days,

2808
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:08,670
like three, four, five days.

2809
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:09,899
So people should definitely

2810
01:30:09,899 --> 01:30:11,853
check out the video in the blog post.

2811
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:14,427
Can you explain what Hoodmaps is

2812
01:30:14,426 --> 01:30:16,109
and what this whole-
- Yeah.

2813
01:30:16,109 --> 01:30:16,942
- This process was?

2814
01:30:16,943 --> 01:30:18,030
- So I was traveling,

2815
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:20,309
and I was still trying
to find problems, right?

2816
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:23,550
I would discover that like
everybody's experience of a city

2817
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:25,420
is different because they
stay in different areas.

2818
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,970
- Yeah.
- So I'm from Amsterdam

2819
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:30,000
and when I grew up in
Amsterdam or I didn't grow up,

2820
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,560
but I lived there, in university,

2821
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,930
I knew that center is like in Europe,

2822
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:35,820
the centers are always tourist areas.

2823
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:37,799
So they're super busy,

2824
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,420
they're not very authentic.

2825
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:40,560
They're not really Dutch culture,

2826
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,690
it's Amsterdam tourist culture.

2827
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:44,549
So when people would travel
to Amsterdam would say,

2828
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:47,970
don't go to the center, go to Southeast

2829
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:50,850
of the center, Jordaan or
the De Pijp or something,

2830
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,810
more hipster areas.

2831
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,100
A little more authentic
culture of Amsterdam.

2832
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,447
That's where I would live,

2833
01:30:55,447 --> 01:30:56,943
and where I would go.

2834
01:30:58,079 --> 01:30:59,699
And I thought this could be like an app

2835
01:30:59,699 --> 01:31:01,559
where you can have like a Google maps

2836
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,850
and you put colors over it.

2837
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:04,950
You have areas that are like color code.

2838
01:31:04,949 --> 01:31:07,050
Red is tourists, green is rich,

2839
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:09,630
green money, yellow is hipster.

2840
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:10,554
You can figure out where you need to go

2841
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:11,520
in the city when you travel,

2842
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,353
'cause I was traveling a lot.

2843
01:31:12,353 --> 01:31:13,649
I wanted to go to the cool spots.

2844
01:31:13,649 --> 01:31:15,420
- So just use color.
- Yeah.

2845
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,350
Color, yeah.

2846
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,520
Yeah, and I would use a Canvas.

2847
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,960
So I thought, okay, what do I need?

2848
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:19,792
I need to-

2849
01:31:19,792 --> 01:31:22,380
- Did you know that you
would be using a Canvas?

2850
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,550
- No, I didn't know it was possible,

2851
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:24,382
'cause I didn't know.

2852
01:31:24,382 --> 01:31:25,961
- So this is the cool thing.

2853
01:31:25,961 --> 01:31:26,793
People should really check out.

2854
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:27,840
- This is how it started.

2855
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,244
- Because you're honestly
capture so beautifully,

2856
01:31:32,243 --> 01:31:33,779
the humbling aspects,

2857
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:36,689
the embarrassing aspects of
like not knowing what to do.

2858
01:31:36,689 --> 01:31:38,460
It's like how do I do this?

2859
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:41,279
And you document yourself.

2860
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:42,112
Yeah, you're right.

2861
01:31:42,113 --> 01:31:45,030
Dude, I feel embarrassed
about myself. (laughs)

2862
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:45,862
- Oh, really, yeah.

2863
01:31:45,863 --> 01:31:46,963
- It's called being alive.

2864
01:31:46,963 --> 01:31:48,600
Nice.

2865
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,070
So you're like, you don't
know anything about,

2866
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:52,130
so Canvas is a HTML5 thing

2867
01:31:56,430 --> 01:31:58,380
that allows you to draw shapes.

2868
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,212
- Yeah, draw images.

2869
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:00,420
Just draw pixels essentially so.

2870
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:01,252
- Yeah.

2871
01:32:01,252 --> 01:32:02,609
- And that was special back then.

2872
01:32:02,609 --> 01:32:04,649
Because before you could only
have like elements, right?

2873
01:32:04,649 --> 01:32:07,349
So you wanna draw a pixel, use a Canvas.

2874
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:08,760
And I knew I needed to draw pixels

2875
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,530
'cause I need to draw these colors.

2876
01:32:10,529 --> 01:32:11,362
And I felt like, okay,

2877
01:32:11,363 --> 01:32:14,940
I'll get like a Google maps iframe embed,

2878
01:32:14,939 --> 01:32:18,059
and then I'll put a Dave on
top of it with the colors,

2879
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,913
and I'll do like opacity
50, so it kind of shows.

2880
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:23,369
So I did that with Canvas.

2881
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:25,349
And then I started drawing,

2882
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,579
and then I felt like,

2883
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:27,630
obviously, other people need to edit this

2884
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:30,539
'cause I cannot draw
all these things myself.

2885
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:32,653
So I crowdsource it again,

2886
01:32:32,654 --> 01:32:33,930
and you would draw on the map

2887
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:36,012
and then it would send the
pixel data to the server.

2888
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:37,679
It would put it in the database,

2889
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:40,440
and then I would have a robot
running like a cron job,

2890
01:32:40,439 --> 01:32:41,639
which every week would calculate,

2891
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,140
or every day would calculate.

2892
01:32:43,140 --> 01:32:44,400
Okay, so Amsterdam Center,

2893
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,679
there's like six people say,

2894
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,840
it's tourist, this part of the center,

2895
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,150
but two people say, it's like hipster.

2896
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,649
Okay, so the tourist part wins, right?

2897
01:32:52,649 --> 01:32:53,759
It's just an array.

2898
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,199
So find the most common value

2899
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:58,063
in a little pixel area on a map.

2900
01:32:58,064 --> 01:33:00,810
So if most people say it's
tourists, it's tourists,

2901
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:02,460
and it becomes red.

2902
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,399
And I would do that for all
the GPS corners in the world.

2903
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:08,279
- Can we just clarify-
- Yeah.

2904
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,923
- As a human that's contributing to this,

2905
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:11,220
do you have to be in that location

2906
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:12,476
to make the label or do you?

2907
01:33:12,476 --> 01:33:14,819
- No, people just type
in cities and go like,

2908
01:33:14,819 --> 01:33:16,829
go berserk and start drawing everywhere.

2909
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:18,569
- Would they draw shapes
or would they draw pixels?

2910
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:19,649
- Man, they drew like crazy stuff.

2911
01:33:19,649 --> 01:33:21,059
Like offensive symbols.

2912
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,370
I cannot mention they would draw penises.

2913
01:33:23,369 --> 01:33:25,949
- I mean, that's obviously a guy thing.

2914
01:33:25,949 --> 01:33:27,359
- I would do the same thing, draw penises.

2915
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:28,439
- That's the first thing.
(Pieter laughs)

2916
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:30,569
When I show up to Mars
and there's no cameras,

2917
01:33:30,569 --> 01:33:31,889
I'm drawing penis on the sand.

2918
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,360
- Man, I did it in the snow, you know,

2919
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:35,279
but the penises did not become a problem,

2920
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:36,989
'cause I knew that not
everybody would draw a penis

2921
01:33:36,989 --> 01:33:38,519
and not in the same place.

2922
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,470
So most people would use it fairly.

2923
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:42,990
So just if I had enough crowdsource data.

2924
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:44,639
So you have all these pixels on top of it.

2925
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:45,472
It's like a layer of pixels.
- Yeah.

2926
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:47,670
- And then you choose
the most common pixel.

2927
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:51,539
So yeah, it's just like a
bowl, but in visual format.

2928
01:33:51,539 --> 01:33:54,932
And it worked and within
a week got enough data,

2929
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,390
and it was like cities
that did really well,

2930
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:00,720
like Los Angeles, a lot of
people started using it.

2931
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,220
Like most data's in Los Angeles.

2932
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:05,704
- Because Los Angeles has
defined neighborhoods.

2933
01:34:05,704 --> 01:34:07,260
- Yeah.
- And not just

2934
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,869
in terms of the official labels,

2935
01:34:09,869 --> 01:34:12,000
but like what they're known for.

2936
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,832
- [Pieter] Yeah.

2937
01:34:13,829 --> 01:34:16,409
- Did you provide the categories

2938
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:18,689
that they were allowed to use as labels?

2939
01:34:18,689 --> 01:34:20,519
- The colors, yeah.
- As colors.

2940
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,770
- So I think you can see there,

2941
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:25,530
there's like hipster,
tourist, rich, business.

2942
01:34:25,529 --> 01:34:26,639
There's always a business area, right?

2943
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:28,020
And then there's a residential.

2944
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,580
Residential is gray.

2945
01:34:29,579 --> 01:34:31,109
So I thought those were
the most common things

2946
01:34:31,109 --> 01:34:32,039
in the city kind of.

2947
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:33,210
- And a little bit meme,

2948
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,949
like it's almost fun to label it

2949
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:35,909
as that, right?
- Yeah.

2950
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:37,380
I mean obviously, it's simplified,

2951
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,760
but you need to simplify this stuff.

2952
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,440
You don't wanna have too many categories.

2953
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:43,799
And it's essentially just
like using a paint brush

2954
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,329
where you select the color in a bottom,

2955
01:34:45,329 --> 01:34:47,100
you stick the category
and you start drawing.

2956
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,539
There's no instruction.

2957
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:49,949
There's no manual.

2958
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:52,643
And then I also added
tagging so people could like

2959
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:55,260
write something on a specific location.

2960
01:34:55,260 --> 01:35:00,260
So don't go here or here's
like nice cafe and stuff.

2961
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,217
And man, the memes that came from that.

2962
01:35:02,216 --> 01:35:03,505
And I also had upvoting,

2963
01:35:03,506 --> 01:35:06,000
so that the tags could be upvoted.

2964
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,039
So the memes that came
from that is like amazing.

2965
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:10,189
People in Los Angeles
would write crazy stuff.

2966
01:35:10,189 --> 01:35:12,539
It would go viral in all these cities.

2967
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,225
You can allow your location

2968
01:35:15,225 --> 01:35:17,076
and will probably send you to Austin.

2969
01:35:17,076 --> 01:35:18,750
- (laughs) Okay, so we're looking,

2970
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:23,750
(laughs) oh boy, drunk hipsters.

2971
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:30,475
- AirBroNBros.
- AirBroNBros.

2972
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:31,560
- Gentrifiers.

2973
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,750
- Hipster girls who do cocaine.

2974
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:36,180
- I saw a guy in a fish
costume get beaten up here.

2975
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,500
- Yep,

2976
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,332
that seems also accurate.

2977
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,350
- Overpriced and underwhelming.

2978
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:45,350
- (laughs) Let me see, let me
make sure this is accurate.

2979
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,032
Let's see.

2980
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,800
Dirty Sixth for people who know Austin

2981
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,930
know that that's important to label.

2982
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:57,600
Sixth Street is famous in Austin.

2983
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,690
Dirty Sixth drunk frat boys, accurate.

2984
01:36:00,689 --> 01:36:01,679
Drunk frat bros.

2985
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,095
Continued on sixth, very well -known.

2986
01:36:03,095 --> 01:36:06,300
- West Sixth douchebros.
- West Sixth douchebros.

2987
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:07,980
- They go from frat to douche.
- Douche.

2988
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:09,809
I mean it's very accurate so far.

2989
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:11,460
- Really.

2990
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:14,073
- They only let hot people live here.

2991
01:36:15,122 --> 01:36:17,853
(laughs) I think that might be accurate.

2992
01:36:19,033 --> 01:36:20,283
- It's like the district.

2993
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:22,949
Exercise freaks on the river.

2994
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:23,970
Yeah, that's true.

2995
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:25,980
- Dog runners accurate.
- Yeah.

2996
01:36:25,979 --> 01:36:28,319
- Saw a guy in the fish
costume get beat up here.

2997
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:29,920
- I wanna know the story.

2998
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,340
- So that's all user contributed.

2999
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,110
- Yeah, and that's like stuff
I couldn't come up with it,

3000
01:36:34,109 --> 01:36:34,942
'cause I don't know Austin,

3001
01:36:34,943 --> 01:36:37,619
I don't know the memes
here in the subcultures.

3002
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:39,707
- And then me as a user can
upload or down vote this.

3003
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:40,739
- [Pieter] Yes.

3004
01:36:40,739 --> 01:36:41,907
- So this is completely crowdsourced.

3005
01:36:41,908 --> 01:36:43,950
- It's like 'cause of
Reddit upvote, downvote,

3006
01:36:43,949 --> 01:36:45,359
took it from there.

3007
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:47,969
- That's really, really, really powerful.

3008
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,890
Single people with dogs, accurate.

3009
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:51,360
At which point did it go from colors

3010
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:53,670
to the actually showing the text?

3011
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:55,920
- I think I added the
text like a week after.

3012
01:36:58,283 --> 01:36:59,640
And so here's like the pixels.

3013
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,472
- So that's really cool.

3014
01:37:00,472 --> 01:37:01,305
The pixels, how do you go from that?

3015
01:37:01,305 --> 01:37:02,639
That's a huge amount of data.

3016
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,230
- Yeah.

3017
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:07,259
- Now looking at an image where it's just

3018
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,699
a sea of pixels that
call it different colors.

3019
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:10,739
- Yeah.
- In a city.

3020
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:12,599
So how do you combine that to be a thing

3021
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,070
that actually makes it some sense?

3022
01:37:14,069 --> 01:37:16,049
- I think here the problem
was that you have this data,

3023
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:19,239
but it's like it's not
locked to one location.

3024
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:21,179
- Yeah.
- So I had to normalize it.

3025
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:23,310
So when you click, when you draw on a map,

3026
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,740
it will show you the
specific pixel location

3027
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:26,909
and you can convert the pixel location

3028
01:37:26,909 --> 01:37:28,170
to a GPS coordinate, right?

3029
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:29,699
Like latitude, longitudes.

3030
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:31,139
But the number will have a lot of commas

3031
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:32,160
or a lot of decimals, right?

3032
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:33,210
Because it's very specific,

3033
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:35,220
it's like this specific part of the table.

3034
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:37,350
So what you wanna do is
you wanna take that pixel

3035
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:40,770
and you wanna normalize it
by removing like decimals,

3036
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:41,940
which I discovered,

3037
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,769
so you're talking about this neighborhood,

3038
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:44,640
or this street, right?

3039
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,583
And so that's what I did.

3040
01:37:45,582 --> 01:37:47,159
I just took the decimals off

3041
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:48,730
and then I saved it like this.

3042
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:52,229
And then it starts going to like a grid.

3043
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:54,569
And then you have like a grid of data.

3044
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:55,949
You get like a pixel map kind of.

3045
01:37:55,949 --> 01:37:58,139
- And then you said it looks kind of ugly,

3046
01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:59,970
so then you smooth it.

3047
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:02,070
- Yeah, I started adding
blurring and stuff.

3048
01:38:02,069 --> 01:38:04,170
I think now it's not smooth again,

3049
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,250
'cause I liked it better.

3050
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:07,319
People like the pixel look kinda.

3051
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:09,420
Yeah, a lot of people use
it and it keeps going viral.

3052
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:13,350
And every time my maps bill like Mapbox,

3053
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,250
I had to stop using...

3054
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,380
You first use Google Maps, it went viral,

3055
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,453
and Google Maps, it was out of credits.

3056
01:38:20,483 --> 01:38:21,570
It's so funny,

3057
01:38:21,569 --> 01:38:23,282
when I launched it, it went viral.

3058
01:38:24,449 --> 01:38:26,189
Google Maps, the map didn't load anymore.

3059
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:27,539
It says over the limits,

3060
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:29,390
you need to contact enterprise sales.

3061
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:32,439
But I need now like a map.

3062
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:34,139
And I don't wanna
contact enterprise sales.

3063
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:36,720
I don't wanna go on a call
schedule with some calendar.

3064
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,250
So I switched to Mapbox,

3065
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,869
and then had Mapbox for years,

3066
01:38:39,869 --> 01:38:41,550
and then it went viral

3067
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,552
and I had a bill of
$20,000 was like last year.

3068
01:38:45,449 --> 01:38:46,500
So they helped me with the bill.

3069
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,989
They said, "You can pay less."

3070
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,849
And then I now switched
to like a open source

3071
01:38:50,850 --> 01:38:52,770
kind of map platform.

3072
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:54,480
So it's a very expensive product

3073
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:56,279
and never made any dollar money.

3074
01:38:56,279 --> 01:38:57,112
But it's very fun.

3075
01:38:57,113 --> 01:38:58,140
But it's very expensive.

3076
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,820
- What do you learn from that?

3077
01:38:59,819 --> 01:39:02,639
So like from that experience,

3078
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,240
'cause when you leverage
somebody else's through the API.

3079
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,779
- Yeah, I mean I don't
think a map hosting service

3080
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:11,309
should cost this much.

3081
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,800
But I could host it myself,

3082
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:14,880
but that would be...

3083
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,867
I dunno how to do that,

3084
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:16,869
but I could do that.

3085
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:19,109
- Yeah, it's super complicated.

3086
01:39:19,109 --> 01:39:20,519
- I think that the thing
is more about like,

3087
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,074
you can't make money with this project.

3088
01:39:22,073 --> 01:39:24,489
I tried to do many things
to make money with it

3089
01:39:25,498 --> 01:39:26,340
and it hasn't worked.

3090
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:28,319
You talked about like possibly doing

3091
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:30,000
advertisements on it or some somehow.

3092
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,832
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3093
01:39:30,832 --> 01:39:32,612
- Or people sponsoring it, yeah.

3094
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:33,900
It's really surprising to me

3095
01:39:33,899 --> 01:39:37,229
that people don't want to advertise on it.

3096
01:39:37,229 --> 01:39:39,629
- I think map apps are
very hard to like monetize.

3097
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,190
Google Maps also doesn't
really make money.

3098
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:42,239
Sometimes you see these ads,

3099
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:44,590
but I don't think there's
a lot of money there.

3100
01:39:45,449 --> 01:39:47,880
You could put like a banner
ad but it's kind of ugly,

3101
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,090
and the product is kind of
like, it's kind of cool.

3102
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:52,619
So it's kinda fun to like subsidize it.

3103
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:54,132
And it's kinda a little
bit part of Nomad List.

3104
01:39:54,132 --> 01:39:56,382
I put it on Nomad List
in the cities as well.

3105
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:58,739
But I also realized,

3106
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,569
you don't need to monetize everything.

3107
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:01,920
Some products are just cool

3108
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,569
and it's cool to have Hoodmaps exist.

3109
01:40:06,569 --> 01:40:08,286
I want this to exist, right?

3110
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:10,050
- Yeah, there's a bunch
of stuff you've created

3111
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:11,670
that I'm just glad exists in this world.

3112
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:12,502
That's true.

3113
01:40:12,502 --> 01:40:14,039
And it's a whole nother puzzle.

3114
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:17,670
And I'm surprised to figure out
how to make money off of it.

3115
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:19,680
I'm surprised maps don't make money,

3116
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,390
but you're right, it's hard.

3117
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:22,619
It's hard to make money.
- Yeah.

3118
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:24,539
- 'Cause there's a lot of compute required

3119
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:26,069
to actually bring it to life.

3120
01:40:26,069 --> 01:40:27,421
- Also, where do you put the ad, right?

3121
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:30,449
If you have a website,
you can put an ad box

3122
01:40:30,449 --> 01:40:32,579
or you can do a product
placement or something.

3123
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:33,662
But you're talking about a map app

3124
01:40:33,662 --> 01:40:36,659
that where 90% of the interface is a map.

3125
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:37,884
So what are you gonna do?

3126
01:40:37,884 --> 01:40:40,409
It's hard to figure out where is this?

3127
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:42,569
- Yeah, and people don't wanna pay for it.

3128
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:45,179
- No, exactly, because if
you make people pay for it,

3129
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:47,130
you lose 99% of the user base

3130
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:48,600
and you lose the crowdsource data.

3131
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,590
So it's not fun anymore.

3132
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,483
It stops being accurate, right?

3133
01:40:52,751 --> 01:40:55,560
They pay for it by crowdsourcing the data,

3134
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,360
but then, yeah, it's fine.

3135
01:40:57,359 --> 01:40:59,219
It doesn't make money, but it's cool.

3136
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:02,430
- But that said, Nomad List makes money.

3137
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:03,262
- Yeah.

3138
01:41:03,262 --> 01:41:05,399
- So what was the story behind Nomad List?

3139
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:07,109
So Nomad List started

3140
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:08,969
because I was in Chiang Mai in Thailand,

3141
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,100
which is now like the second city here.

3142
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:14,613
And I was working on my laptop.

3143
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:16,988
I met like other nomads there,

3144
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,930
and I was like, okay, this
seems like a cool thing to do,

3145
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:21,480
like working on your laptop
in a different country,

3146
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:23,099
kinda travel around.

3147
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,620
But back then the internet
everywhere was very slow.

3148
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:26,609
So the internet was fast in,

3149
01:41:26,609 --> 01:41:28,319
for example, Holland or United States,

3150
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:31,319
but in a lot of parts in South America

3151
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:33,989
or Asia was very slow, like 0.5 megabits.

3152
01:41:33,989 --> 01:41:35,889
So you couldn't watch a YouTube video.

3153
01:41:36,930 --> 01:41:39,659
Thailand weirdly had
like quite fast internet.

3154
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:43,800
But I wanted to find like
other cities where I could go

3155
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,980
to like work on my laptop,
whatever, and travel.

3156
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:48,089
But we needed like fast internet.

3157
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:51,060
So I was like, let's crowdsource

3158
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,600
this information with a spreadsheet.

3159
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,329
And I also needed to
know the cost of living,

3160
01:41:54,329 --> 01:41:55,162
'cause I didn't have a lot of money.

3161
01:41:55,162 --> 01:41:56,729
I had $500 a month.

3162
01:41:56,729 --> 01:41:59,669
So I had to find a place where
the rent was $200 per month

3163
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,949
or something where I had some money

3164
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,630
that I could actually rent something

3165
01:42:04,807 --> 01:42:06,119
and there was Nomad List.

3166
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:07,369
And it still runs.

3167
01:42:07,369 --> 01:42:09,420
I think it's now almost 10 years.

3168
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:10,890
- So it's just to describe how it works.

3169
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:11,722
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3170
01:42:11,722 --> 01:42:13,800
- I'm looking at Chiang Mai here.

3171
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,989
There's a total score, rank number two.

3172
01:42:15,989 --> 01:42:17,429
- Yeah, that's a number score.

3173
01:42:17,430 --> 01:42:19,890
- 4.82 like by members.

3174
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:23,100
But it's looking at the internet.

3175
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,870
In this case, it's fast.
- Yeah.

3176
01:42:24,869 --> 01:42:28,590
- Fun, temperature, humidity, air quality,

3177
01:42:28,590 --> 01:42:33,590
safety, food safety, crime, racism

3178
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,659
or lack of crime, lack of
racism, educational level,

3179
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:40,319
power grid, vulnerability, to
climate change, income level.

3180
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:41,729
- It's a little much.
- English.

3181
01:42:41,729 --> 01:42:43,139
It's awesome.

3182
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:43,972
It's awesome.

3183
01:42:43,972 --> 01:42:45,239
Walkability.
- Keep getting stuff.

3184
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:46,319
- Because for certain groups of people,

3185
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:47,309
certain things really matter.

3186
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:48,510
And this is really cool.

3187
01:42:48,510 --> 01:42:49,530
- Yeah.
- Happiness.

3188
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:50,849
I'd love to ask you about that.

3189
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:54,303
Nightlife, free Wi-Fi, AC,

3190
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:58,451
female friendly, freedom of speech.

3191
01:42:58,451 --> 01:43:00,090
- Yeah, not so good in Thailand.

3192
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,103
- Values derived from national statistics.

3193
01:43:02,103 --> 01:43:04,399
(laughs) I like how that one.

3194
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:05,231
- I need to do that

3195
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:06,930
because the data sets
are usually national.

3196
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:07,800
They're not on city level,

3197
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,783
right?
- Yes.

3198
01:43:08,783 --> 01:43:09,615
- So I dunno about the freedom of speech

3199
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:10,800
between Bangkok or Chiang Mai.

3200
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,060
I know them in Thailand.

3201
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,590
- I mean this is really fascinating.

3202
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:15,090
So this is for city?

3203
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:15,922
- Yeah.

3204
01:43:15,922 --> 01:43:17,460
- Is basically rating
all the different things

3205
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:18,779
that matter to you and internet.

3206
01:43:18,779 --> 01:43:21,389
And this is all crowdsourced.

3207
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:22,740
- Well, so started crowdsourced,

3208
01:43:22,739 --> 01:43:27,739
but then I realized that
you can download more

3209
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:30,659
accurate data sets from
like public source,

3210
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:31,492
like World Bank.

3211
01:43:31,493 --> 01:43:34,470
They have a lot of public
data sets, United Nations,

3212
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:35,980
and you can download a lot of data there,

3213
01:43:35,979 --> 01:43:38,309
which you can freely use.

3214
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:40,050
I started getting frauds
crowdsource data where,

3215
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:42,000
for example, people from India,

3216
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,346
they really love India,

3217
01:43:43,346 --> 01:43:46,259
and they would submit the best scores

3218
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:47,789
for everything in India.

3219
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:48,840
And not just like one person,

3220
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,159
but like a lot of people,

3221
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,930
they would love to pump India.

3222
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:53,400
And I'm like, I love India too,

3223
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:55,799
but that's not valid data.

3224
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,420
So you started getting
discrepancies in the data

3225
01:43:57,420 --> 01:44:00,060
between where people where from and stuff.

3226
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,553
So I started switching to data sets,

3227
01:44:03,689 --> 01:44:04,619
and now it's mostly data sets,

3228
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:06,054
but one thing that's
still crowdsourced is,

3229
01:44:06,054 --> 01:44:07,590
so people add where they are,

3230
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:10,440
they add their travels to their profile

3231
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:13,379
and use that data to see
which places are upcoming

3232
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:15,300
and which places are popular now.

3233
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,300
So about half the ranking
you see here is based on

3234
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,980
actual digital nomads who are there.

3235
01:44:19,979 --> 01:44:21,764
You can click on the city,
you can click on people,

3236
01:44:21,765 --> 01:44:22,860
and you can see the people,

3237
01:44:22,859 --> 01:44:24,569
the users that are actually there.

3238
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:27,420
And it's like 30,000, 45,000 members.

3239
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:29,203
So these people are in Austin now.

3240
01:44:29,203 --> 01:44:30,852
- 1,800 remote workers in Austin now.

3241
01:44:30,851 --> 01:44:31,684
- Yeah.

3242
01:44:31,685 --> 01:44:34,470
- Of which 8+ members checked in.

3243
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:36,840
Members who will be here soon and go.

3244
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:37,789
- Yeah, so we have meetups.
- It's amazing.

3245
01:44:37,789 --> 01:44:39,899
- So people organize their own meetups

3246
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,929
and we have about, I
think like 30 per month.

3247
01:44:42,930 --> 01:44:44,789
So it's like one meetup a day.

3248
01:44:44,789 --> 01:44:45,630
And I don't do anything.

3249
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:46,880
They organize themselves.

3250
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:49,680
It's a whole black box.

3251
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:52,320
It just runs and I don't do a lot on it.

3252
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:54,719
It pulls data from
everywhere and it just works.

3253
01:44:56,130 --> 01:44:57,270
- Cons of Austin.

3254
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:59,220
It's too expensive, very
sweaty, and humid now.

3255
01:44:59,220 --> 01:45:00,900
Difficult to make friends.
- Difficult to make friends.

3256
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:01,732
Interesting, right?

3257
01:45:01,733 --> 01:45:02,565
I didn't know that.

3258
01:45:02,565 --> 01:45:04,349
- Difficult to make friends-
- In Austin.

3259
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:05,850
- But its all crowdsource,

3260
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:07,770
but mostly it's pros.

3261
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:09,750
- Yeah, Austin's very-
- Pretty safe, fast internet.

3262
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,060
- I understand why it
says not safe for women

3263
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,350
to check the dataset.

3264
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:14,880
It feels safe.

3265
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,650
The problem with a lot of
places like United States

3266
01:45:16,649 --> 01:45:18,269
is that it depends per area, right?

3267
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:19,103
- Yeah.

3268
01:45:19,103 --> 01:45:20,190
- So if you get like city level data

3269
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:21,210
or nation level data,

3270
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:23,399
it's like Brazil is the worst

3271
01:45:23,399 --> 01:45:27,059
because the range in like safe and wealthy

3272
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:29,280
and not safe is like huge.

3273
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:31,500
So you can't say many things about Brazil.

3274
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,689
- So once they actually
show up to the city,

3275
01:45:33,689 --> 01:45:35,879
how do you figure out what area?

3276
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,350
Like where to get fast Internet.

3277
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:40,200
For example, for me, it's
consistently a struggle

3278
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,609
to figure out like-
- Still.

3279
01:45:41,609 --> 01:45:45,149
- Hotels with fast Wi-Fi,
for example, like a place.

3280
01:45:45,149 --> 01:45:47,819
Okay, okay, I show up to a city.

3281
01:45:47,819 --> 01:45:49,529
There's a lot of fascinating puzzles,

3282
01:45:49,529 --> 01:45:50,362
and I haven't figured out a way

3283
01:45:50,363 --> 01:45:52,289
to actually solve this puzzle.

3284
01:45:52,289 --> 01:45:54,239
When I show up to a city,

3285
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:57,460
figuring out where I can
get fast internet connection

3286
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:01,289
and for podcasting purposes

3287
01:46:01,289 --> 01:46:04,119
where I can find a place
with a table that's quiet.

3288
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:04,952
- Right, yeah, yeah.

3289
01:46:04,953 --> 01:46:07,260
- That's not easy.
- Construction sounds.

3290
01:46:07,260 --> 01:46:08,640
- All kinds of sounds.

3291
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,140
You get to learn about all the sources

3292
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,700
of sounds in the world,

3293
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,159
and also the quality of the room

3294
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:18,449
because the emptier the room

3295
01:46:18,449 --> 01:46:21,210
and if it's just walls
without any curtains

3296
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:22,170
or any of this kind of stuff,

3297
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:25,529
then there's echoes in the room anyway.

3298
01:46:25,529 --> 01:46:28,920
But you figure out that a lot
of hotels don't have tables.

3299
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:29,804
They don't have like normal.

3300
01:46:29,804 --> 01:46:30,930
- They have this weird desk, right?

3301
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:33,060
- Yeah, they have-
- But it's not a center table.

3302
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:37,200
- Yep, and if you want get a nicer hotel

3303
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:38,819
where it is more spacious and so on.

3304
01:46:38,819 --> 01:46:41,009
They usually have these like boutique,

3305
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:43,980
fancy looking, modernist-
- Annoying tables.

3306
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:44,812
- Tables, that don't-
- Yeah, it's too designy.

3307
01:46:44,813 --> 01:46:46,260
- It's too designy.
- Yeah.

3308
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:47,640
- They're not really real tables.

3309
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,440
- What if you get Ikea?

3310
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:50,460
- Buy Ikea?

3311
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,230
- Yeah, before you
arrive you order an Ikea.

3312
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:53,279
- Yeah.
- Nomads do this.

3313
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:54,210
They get desks.

3314
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,069
- I feel like you should be
able to show up to a place

3315
01:46:56,069 --> 01:46:58,049
and have the desk.

3316
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:00,090
Unless you stay in there for a long time.

3317
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:02,310
Just the entire assembly, all that.

3318
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:05,460
Airbnb is so unreliable.

3319
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,724
The range in quality that you get-

3320
01:47:08,724 --> 01:47:10,023
- Yeah.
- Is huge.

3321
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:13,829
Hotels have a lot of
problems, pros and cons.

3322
01:47:13,829 --> 01:47:15,779
Hotels have the problem that the pictures,

3323
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:18,179
somehow never have good
representative pictures

3324
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,287
of what's actually
going to be in the room.

3325
01:47:19,287 --> 01:47:20,537
- And that's the problem.

3326
01:47:21,537 --> 01:47:23,070
Fake photos, man.

3327
01:47:23,069 --> 01:47:25,469
- If I could have the
kind of data you have

3328
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:27,655
on Nomad List for hotels.
- Yeah, yeah, man.

3329
01:47:27,655 --> 01:47:30,090
- And I feel like you can make
a lot of money on that too.

3330
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,529
- Yeah, the booking fees affiliate, right?

3331
01:47:31,529 --> 01:47:32,362
I thought about this idea,

3332
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:33,823
'cause we have the same problem.

3333
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:34,680
I go to hotels,

3334
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,913
and there's specific
ones that are very good

3335
01:47:36,912 --> 01:47:39,304
and I know now the chains and stuff,

3336
01:47:39,305 --> 01:47:42,390
but even if you go to
some chains are very bad

3337
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:44,579
in a specific city and
very good in other cities.

3338
01:47:44,579 --> 01:47:47,289
- And each individual hotel
has a lot of kinds of rooms.

3339
01:47:47,289 --> 01:47:48,182
- Yeah.

3340
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:51,449
- Some are more expensive,
some are cheaper, and so on.

3341
01:47:51,449 --> 01:47:55,409
But you can get the details
of what's in the room.

3342
01:47:55,409 --> 01:47:57,180
What's the actual layout of the room,

3343
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:58,860
what is the view of the room.
- You scan it.

3344
01:47:58,859 --> 01:48:01,349
- I feel like as a
hotel you can win a lot.

3345
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,570
So first, you create a service

3346
01:48:03,569 --> 01:48:07,289
that allows you to have high
resolution data about a hotel,

3347
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:09,569
then one hotel signs up for that.

3348
01:48:09,569 --> 01:48:12,779
I would 100% use that
website to look for a hotel

3349
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:15,630
instead of the crappy alternatives

3350
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:16,859
that don't give any information.

3351
01:48:16,859 --> 01:48:18,689
And I feel like there'll be this pressure

3352
01:48:18,689 --> 01:48:20,699
for all the hotels to join that site

3353
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:22,649
and you could make a ton of money,

3354
01:48:22,649 --> 01:48:24,089
'cause hotels make a lot of money.

3355
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:24,922
- I think it's true.

3356
01:48:24,922 --> 01:48:25,829
But the problem is with these hotels,

3357
01:48:25,829 --> 01:48:27,420
like it's same with airline industry.

3358
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:29,310
Why does every airline website suck

3359
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:30,690
when you try book a flights?

3360
01:48:30,689 --> 01:48:31,649
- Yeah.
- It's very strange.

3361
01:48:31,649 --> 01:48:32,549
Why does it have to suck?

3362
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,050
Obviously, there's competition here.

3363
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,400
Why doesn't the best website win?

3364
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:36,659
- What's the explanation of that?

3365
01:48:36,659 --> 01:48:37,859
- Man, I thought about this for years.

3366
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:41,279
So I think it's like I have
to book the flight anyway.

3367
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:43,199
I know there's a route that they take

3368
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,479
and I need to book, for
example, Qatar Airlines,

3369
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:48,032
and I need to get through this process.

3370
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:52,649
And with a hotel similar,
you need a hotel anyway.

3371
01:48:52,649 --> 01:48:55,949
So do you have time to like
figure out the best one?

3372
01:48:55,949 --> 01:48:56,782
Not really.

3373
01:48:56,783 --> 01:48:58,650
You kind of just need
to get the place booked

3374
01:48:58,649 --> 01:49:00,389
and you need to get the flight

3375
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:03,180
and you'll go through
the pain of this process.

3376
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:05,039
And that's why this process
always sucks so much

3377
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,140
for hotels and airline websites and stuff.

3378
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,600
Because they don't have an
incentive to improve it,

3379
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,640
because generally only for

3380
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,140
a super upper segment of the market,

3381
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,030
I think super high luxury,

3382
01:49:15,029 --> 01:49:17,250
it affects the actual booking, right?

3383
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,082
- I don't know.

3384
01:49:18,082 --> 01:49:20,219
I think that's an interesting theory.

3385
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,746
I think that must be a different theory.

3386
01:49:21,746 --> 01:49:25,619
My theory would be that great engineers,

3387
01:49:25,619 --> 01:49:27,921
great software engineers are
not allowed to make changes.

3388
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:28,753
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3389
01:49:28,753 --> 01:49:30,960
- Basically, there's
some kind of bureaucracy,

3390
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,550
there's way too many managers.

3391
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:34,440
There's a lot of bureaucracy.

3392
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:36,152
And great engineers show up,

3393
01:49:36,153 --> 01:49:37,010
they try to work there

3394
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:38,430
and they're not allowed

3395
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,869
to really make any contributions

3396
01:49:39,869 --> 01:49:40,702
and then they leave.

3397
01:49:40,703 --> 01:49:43,200
And so you have a lot of
mediocre software engineers,

3398
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:44,979
they're not really interested
in improving any other thing.

3399
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:45,811
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3400
01:49:45,811 --> 01:49:48,149
- And literally, they would
like to improve the stuff,

3401
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:51,509
but the bureaucracy of the place,

3402
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:53,400
plus all the bosses,

3403
01:49:53,399 --> 01:49:55,807
all the high up people are
not technical people probably.

3404
01:49:55,807 --> 01:49:56,640
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3405
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:58,319
- They don't know much about web dev.

3406
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:00,599
They don't know much about programming.

3407
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:02,529
So they just don't give any respect.

3408
01:50:02,529 --> 01:50:05,100
- Yeah.
- You have to give the freedom

3409
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:07,800
and the respect to great engineers

3410
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:09,630
as they try to do great things.

3411
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:11,279
That feels like an explanation.

3412
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:13,079
If you were a great programmer,

3413
01:50:13,079 --> 01:50:16,390
would you wanna work
at America Airlines or?

3414
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:18,576
- No, no.

3415
01:50:18,576 --> 01:50:19,697
- I'm torn on that

3416
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:23,340
'cause I actually as
somebody who loves program,

3417
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:26,489
would love to work at America Airlines

3418
01:50:26,489 --> 01:50:27,809
so I can make the thing better.

3419
01:50:27,810 --> 01:50:30,298
- Yeah, I would work there
just to fix it for myself.

3420
01:50:30,298 --> 01:50:31,979
- Yeah, for yourself.

3421
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:35,669
And then you just know how much
suffering you're alleviated.

3422
01:50:35,670 --> 01:50:37,560
- [Pieter] Yeah, yeah, for
the world, for society.

3423
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,930
- Just imagine all the thousands,

3424
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:41,890
maybe millions of people
that go to that website.

3425
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:43,144
- Yeah.
- And have to click

3426
01:50:43,144 --> 01:50:44,909
like a million times.

3427
01:50:44,909 --> 01:50:46,019
It often doesn't work.

3428
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,457
It's clunky, all that kind of stuff.

3429
01:50:47,457 --> 01:50:50,193
You're making their life
just so much better.

3430
01:50:50,193 --> 01:50:51,659
- Much better, yeah.
- Yeah.

3431
01:50:51,659 --> 01:50:52,729
There must be an explanation

3432
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,379
that has to do with
managers and bureaucracies.

3433
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:56,212
- I think it's money.

3434
01:50:56,212 --> 01:50:57,869
Do you know booking.com?

3435
01:50:57,869 --> 01:50:58,979
- Sure.
- So it's a booking.

3436
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:00,069
It's the biggest booking
website in the world.

3437
01:51:00,069 --> 01:51:01,889
- Yeah.
- It's Dutch actually.

3438
01:51:01,890 --> 01:51:03,630
And they have teams

3439
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:04,462
because my friend worked there.

3440
01:51:04,462 --> 01:51:06,719
They have teams for a
specific part of the website,

3441
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:11,280
like a 10 by 10 pixels area
where they run tests on this.

3442
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:12,239
So they run tests like,

3443
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:13,072
and they're famous for this stuff.

3444
01:51:13,073 --> 01:51:14,910
Oh, there's only one room left, right?

3445
01:51:14,909 --> 01:51:16,229
Which is red letters.

3446
01:51:16,229 --> 01:51:17,489
One room left book now.

3447
01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:19,079
And they got a fine

3448
01:51:19,079 --> 01:51:20,369
from the European Union about this,

3449
01:51:20,369 --> 01:51:21,510
kind of interesting.

3450
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:22,342
So they have all these teams

3451
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:23,699
and they run the test for 24 hours.

3452
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:24,532
They go to sleep.

3453
01:51:24,533 --> 01:51:25,620
They wake up next day
they come to the office,

3454
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:27,869
and they see, okay, this performed better.

3455
01:51:27,869 --> 01:51:29,609
This website has become a monster,

3456
01:51:29,609 --> 01:51:32,159
but it's the most revenue generating

3457
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,269
hotel booking website in the world.

3458
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,620
It's number one.

3459
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:37,680
So that shows that it's
not about user experience,

3460
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:38,523
it's about like,

3461
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:40,980
I don't know about making more money,

3462
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:42,452
not every company.

3463
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:45,722
It's a public company,

3464
01:51:45,722 --> 01:51:46,796
if they're optimizing for money.

3465
01:51:46,796 --> 01:51:49,199
- But you can optimize
for money by disrupting,

3466
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:50,229
like making it way better.

3467
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:51,509
- Yeah, but it's always start,

3468
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:52,890
they start with disrupting.

3469
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:55,159
Booking all started as a startup 1997.

3470
01:51:55,158 --> 01:51:58,109
And then they become
like the old shit again.

3471
01:51:58,109 --> 01:52:00,809
Uber now starts to become
a taxi again, right?

3472
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:01,770
It was very good in the beginning.

3473
01:52:01,770 --> 01:52:04,500
Now it's kind of like taxis
now in many places are better.

3474
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,769
They're nicer than Ubers, right?

3475
01:52:06,769 --> 01:52:08,113
So it's like this circle.

3476
01:52:08,113 --> 01:52:10,680
- I think some of it is also just,

3477
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:14,070
it's hard to have ultra
competent engineers.

3478
01:52:14,069 --> 01:52:15,059
- Yeah.

3479
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,220
- Stripe seems like a trivial thing,

3480
01:52:17,220 --> 01:52:19,829
but it's hard to pull off.
- Yeah.

3481
01:52:19,829 --> 01:52:21,300
- Why was it so hard for Amazon

3482
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,980
to have buy with one click?

3483
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:24,899
Which I think is a genius idea.

3484
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:26,702
- Yeah.
- Make buying easier.

3485
01:52:28,194 --> 01:52:31,289
Make it as frictionless as possible.

3486
01:52:31,289 --> 01:52:34,109
Just click a button once
thing you bought the thing.

3487
01:52:34,109 --> 01:52:34,942
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3488
01:52:34,943 --> 01:52:37,680
- As opposed to most of the
web was a lot of clicking,

3489
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:38,512
and it often doesn't work.

3490
01:52:38,512 --> 01:52:39,899
- Yeah.
- Like with the Airlines.

3491
01:52:39,899 --> 01:52:41,039
- Remember the forms would delete,

3492
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:42,420
you could click Next, Submit,

3493
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:45,359
and 404 or something where
your internet would go down.

3494
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:46,649
- Yeah.
- Your modem.

3495
01:52:46,649 --> 01:52:47,670
- Yeah.
- That, man.

3496
01:52:47,670 --> 01:52:49,680
- And I would have an existential crisis.

3497
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,592
The frustration would
take over my whole body.

3498
01:52:51,591 --> 01:52:52,424
- [Pieter] Yes.

3499
01:52:52,425 --> 01:52:53,730
- And I would just wanted to quit life

3500
01:52:53,729 --> 01:52:54,699
for a brief moment there.

3501
01:52:54,699 --> 01:52:55,979
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

3502
01:52:55,979 --> 01:52:57,719
- I'm so happy to form
stays in Google Chrome

3503
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,220
now when something goes wrong.

3504
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:01,710
So Google, somebody at Google

3505
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:03,630
improve society with that, right?

3506
01:53:03,630 --> 01:53:06,449
- Yeah, and one of the
challenges of Google

3507
01:53:06,449 --> 01:53:08,069
is to have the freedom to do that.

3508
01:53:08,069 --> 01:53:09,179
- They don't anymore.

3509
01:53:09,180 --> 01:53:10,431
- There's a bunch of bureaucracy, yeah.

3510
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:11,276
- Yeah, at Google.

3511
01:53:11,277 --> 01:53:12,811
- There's so many brilliant,
brilliant people there.

3512
01:53:12,811 --> 01:53:13,644
- Yeah.

3513
01:53:13,645 --> 01:53:16,800
- But it just moves slowly.
- Yeah.

3514
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,760
- And I wonder why that is,

3515
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,680
and maybe that's the
natural way of a company,

3516
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:22,347
but you have people like Elon who rolls in

3517
01:53:22,346 --> 01:53:24,630
and just fires most of the folks

3518
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:25,619
and always operate,

3519
01:53:25,619 --> 01:53:27,750
like push the company
to operate as a startup,

3520
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,039
even what's already big.

3521
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:30,390
- Yeah, I mean, Apple does this.

3522
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:31,829
I like I started in business school,

3523
01:53:31,829 --> 01:53:35,059
Apple does competing product
teams that operate as startups.

3524
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:37,293
So three to five people,
they make something,

3525
01:53:37,292 --> 01:53:39,659
they have multiple teams
do make the same thing.

3526
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:40,832
The best team wins.

3527
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:42,630
I think you need to emulate

3528
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:45,029
like a free market inside a company

3529
01:53:45,029 --> 01:53:46,041
to make it entrepreneurial.

3530
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:47,010
- Yeah.
- And you need

3531
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:49,320
entrepreneurial mentality in a company

3532
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:52,469
to come up with new
ideas and do it better.

3533
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:55,740
- So one of the things you do
really, really well is learn.

3534
01:53:55,739 --> 01:53:57,659
And you think like you're trying to...

3535
01:53:57,659 --> 01:53:59,426
You have an idea, you try to build it,

3536
01:53:59,426 --> 01:54:01,469
and then you learn everything

3537
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:02,760
you need to in order to build it.

3538
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:04,260
You have your current skills,

3539
01:54:04,260 --> 01:54:06,355
but you need learn just the
minimal amount of stuff.

3540
01:54:06,355 --> 01:54:08,342
So you're a good person to ask like,

3541
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:10,743
how do you learn?

3542
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:13,920
How do you learn quickly and effectively

3543
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,319
and just the stuff you need?

3544
01:54:16,409 --> 01:54:17,550
Just by way of example,

3545
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,699
you did a 30 days learning session on 3D.

3546
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:21,532
- [Pieter] Yeah.

3547
01:54:21,533 --> 01:54:22,440
- Where you documented yourself,

3548
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:23,789
giving yourself only 30 days

3549
01:54:23,789 --> 01:54:25,409
to learn everything you can about 3D.

3550
01:54:25,409 --> 01:54:26,670
- Yeah, I tried to learn virtuality

3551
01:54:26,670 --> 01:54:27,502
'cause I was like...

3552
01:54:27,502 --> 01:54:28,439
This was same as AI,

3553
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:31,136
it came up suddenly like 2016, 2017,

3554
01:54:31,136 --> 01:54:32,670
with I think HTC VIVE,

3555
01:54:32,670 --> 01:54:35,298
this big VR glasses
before Apple Vision Pro.

3556
01:54:35,298 --> 01:54:36,810
I was like, oh, this is gonna be big,

3557
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:37,974
so I need to learn this.

3558
01:54:37,974 --> 01:54:39,750
I know nothing about 3D.

3559
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,449
I installed like, I think Unity,

3560
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:43,282
and Blender and stuff.

3561
01:54:43,283 --> 01:54:45,220
And I started learning all this stuff

3562
01:54:47,399 --> 01:54:49,619
because I thought this was like a new

3563
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:51,239
nascent technology that was gonna be big.

3564
01:54:51,239 --> 01:54:53,699
And if I had the skills for it,

3565
01:54:53,699 --> 01:54:55,500
I could use this to build stuff.

3566
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,332
And so I think with learning for me,

3567
01:54:58,470 --> 01:54:59,302
I think learning is so funny

3568
01:54:59,302 --> 01:55:00,787
'cause people always ask me,

3569
01:55:00,787 --> 01:55:02,670
"How do you learn to code?"

3570
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:03,502
Should I learn to code?"

3571
01:55:03,502 --> 01:55:05,340
And I'm like, "I don't know."

3572
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:06,180
Every day I'm learning.

3573
01:55:06,180 --> 01:55:07,012
It's kind of cliche,

3574
01:55:07,012 --> 01:55:08,430
but every day I'm learning new stuff.

3575
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:10,050
So every day I'm searching on Google

3576
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:11,207
or asking out ChatGPT,

3577
01:55:11,207 --> 01:55:12,930
how to do this thing,
how to do this thing.

3578
01:55:12,930 --> 01:55:15,180
Every day, I'm getting better at my skill.

3579
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,250
So you never stop learning.

3580
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,989
So the whole concept of
like how do you learn?

3581
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:19,822
Well, you never ends.

3582
01:55:19,823 --> 01:55:20,655
So where do you want to be?

3583
01:55:20,655 --> 01:55:22,229
Do you wanna know a little bit?

3584
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:23,789
Or do you wanna know a lot?

3585
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:25,800
Do you wanna do it for your whole life?

3586
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,989
So I think taking action
is the best step to learn.

3587
01:55:27,989 --> 01:55:31,590
So making things like, you know nothing,

3588
01:55:31,590 --> 01:55:32,610
just start making things.

3589
01:55:32,609 --> 01:55:34,559
Okay, so like how to make a website?

3590
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:35,520
Search how to make a website.

3591
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,050
Or nowadays you ask ChatGPT,

3592
01:55:37,050 --> 01:55:37,882
how do I make a website?

3593
01:55:37,882 --> 01:55:38,715
Where do I start?

3594
01:55:38,716 --> 01:55:40,020
It generates codes for you, right?

3595
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,700
Copy the code, put it in a file, save it,

3596
01:55:41,699 --> 01:55:43,619
open it in Google Chrome or whatever.

3597
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:45,987
You have a website and then
you start tweaking with it,

3598
01:55:45,987 --> 01:55:47,880
and you start, okay,
how do I add a button?

3599
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,970
How do I add AI features, right, nowadays.

3600
01:55:50,970 --> 01:55:52,710
So it's like by taking action,

3601
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:55,949
you can learn stuff much
faster than I'm reading books,

3602
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,059
or tutorials.

3603
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,210
- Actually, I'm curious,
let me ask perplexity.

3604
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:02,640
How do I make a website?

3605
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:04,390
I'm just curious what it would say.

3606
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,930
I hope it goes with like
really basic vanilla solutions.

3607
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:11,130
Define your website's purpose.

3608
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:12,119
Choose a domain name.

3609
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:13,979
Select a web hosting provider.

3610
01:56:13,979 --> 01:56:16,559
Choose a website or builder or CMS,

3611
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,000
website build a platform Wix.

3612
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,010
- Tells that Wix or
Squarespace is what I said.

3613
01:56:20,010 --> 01:56:21,409
- Yeah.
- The landing page.

3614
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:27,299
- How do I say if I
wanna program it myself?

3615
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:29,400
Design your website,
create essential pages.

3616
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,500
- Yeah, even tells you
to launch it, right?

3617
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:32,332
Start promoting it.

3618
01:56:32,332 --> 01:56:33,165
- Launch your website.
- Cool.

3619
01:56:33,166 --> 01:56:34,170
- Well, I mean you could do that.

3620
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:36,000
- Yeah, but this is literally it.

3621
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,856
- [Lex] If you wanna make a website.

3622
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:38,340
- This is the basic like Google Analytics,

3623
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:39,903
- Well, you can't make
Nomad List with this way.

3624
01:56:39,903 --> 01:56:41,673
- You can.
- With Wix.

3625
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,682
- No, you can get pretty far, I think.

3626
01:56:44,682 --> 01:56:46,140
- You get pretty far.
- These website builders

3627
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,972
are pretty advanced.

3628
01:56:46,972 --> 01:56:48,670
All you need is a grid of images, right?

3629
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,190
- Yeah.
- That are clickable.

3630
01:56:50,189 --> 01:56:51,255
That open like another page.

3631
01:56:51,256 --> 01:56:53,579
- Yeah.
- You can get quite far.

3632
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:56,372
- How do I learn to program?

3633
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,378
Choose a programming
language to start with.

3634
01:57:03,378 --> 01:57:04,922
- Yeah, FreeCodeCamp is good.

3635
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,720
- Work through resources systematically,

3636
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:13,590
practice coding regularly
for 30, 60 minutes a day.

3637
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:14,670
Consistency is key.

3638
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:15,880
Join programming
communities like Reddit's.

3639
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:16,863
Yeah, yeah.

3640
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:19,979
Yeah, it is pretty good.

3641
01:57:19,979 --> 01:57:21,359
- Yeah.
- It's pretty good.

3642
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:23,099
- So I think it's a very
good starting ground,

3643
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:25,289
'cause imagine you know nothing

3644
01:57:25,289 --> 01:57:26,279
and you wanna make a website,

3645
01:57:26,279 --> 01:57:27,899
you wanna make a startup.

3646
01:57:27,899 --> 01:57:29,969
This is like, that's why, man,

3647
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:33,390
the power of AI for
education is gonna be insane.

3648
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:36,630
People anywhere can ask this question

3649
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:37,739
and start building stuff.

3650
01:57:37,739 --> 01:57:39,239
- Yeah, it clarifies it for sure,

3651
01:57:39,239 --> 01:57:40,289
and just start building.

3652
01:57:40,289 --> 01:57:41,220
Like keep-
- Yeah.

3653
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:42,052
- Build, build.

3654
01:57:42,052 --> 01:57:44,069
Like actually apply the thing,

3655
01:57:44,069 --> 01:57:45,000
whether it's AI,

3656
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,417
or any of the programming
for web development.

3657
01:57:47,417 --> 01:57:50,520
- Yeah.
- Just have a project in mind,

3658
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,750
which I love the idea of
like 12 startups in 12 months

3659
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:58,449
or like build a project almost every day.

3660
01:57:58,449 --> 01:58:00,119
- Yeah.
- Just build a thing.

3661
01:58:00,119 --> 01:58:01,710
- Yeah.
- And get it to work,

3662
01:58:01,710 --> 01:58:03,840
and finish it every single day.

3663
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,130
That's a cool experiment.

3664
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:06,060
- I think that was the inspiration.

3665
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:10,020
There was a girl who did 160 websites

3666
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:11,100
and 160 days or something.

3667
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,720
Literally mini websites.
- Yeah.

3668
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:15,270
- And she learned to code that way.

3669
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:17,670
So I think it's good to
set yourself challenges.

3670
01:58:19,417 --> 01:58:21,090
You can go to some coding bootcamp,

3671
01:58:21,090 --> 01:58:22,650
but I don't think they actually work.

3672
01:58:22,649 --> 01:58:24,000
I think it's better to do,

3673
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,970
for me, how to deduct like self-learning

3674
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:28,260
and setting yourself like challenges

3675
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:30,239
and just getting in,

3676
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:31,072
but you need discipline.

3677
01:58:31,073 --> 01:58:33,090
You need to discipline to keep doing it.

3678
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:35,400
And coding is very,

3679
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,649
it's a steep learning curve to get in.

3680
01:58:37,649 --> 01:58:38,482
It's very annoying.

3681
01:58:38,483 --> 01:58:41,070
Working with computers is very annoying.

3682
01:58:41,069 --> 01:58:44,702
So it can be hard for
people to keep doing it.

3683
01:58:45,899 --> 01:58:49,289
- Yeah, that thing of just
keep doing it and don't quit,

3684
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,079
that urgency that's
required to finish a thing.

3685
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:54,779
That's why it's really powerful
when you documented this,

3686
01:58:54,779 --> 01:58:56,420
the creation of Hoodmaps

3687
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:59,789
or like a working prototype that there is

3688
01:58:59,789 --> 01:59:01,710
just a constant frustration I guess.

3689
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:04,140
It's like oh, okay, how do I do this?

3690
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,610
And then you look it up,

3691
01:59:05,609 --> 01:59:06,442
and you're like, okay,

3692
01:59:06,443 --> 01:59:09,119
you have to interpret the
different options you have.

3693
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,738
- Yeah, man.
- And then just try it,

3694
01:59:11,738 --> 01:59:15,247
and then there's a dopamine rush of like,

3695
01:59:15,247 --> 01:59:17,064
"Ooh, it works cool."
- Man, it's amazing.

3696
01:59:17,064 --> 01:59:19,380
I live streamed it.

3697
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,369
It's on YouTube and stuff.

3698
01:59:20,369 --> 01:59:21,202
People can watch it,

3699
01:59:21,203 --> 01:59:23,463
and it's amazing when things work.

3700
01:59:24,539 --> 01:59:25,890
Look, it's just like a main that you,

3701
01:59:25,890 --> 01:59:26,880
I look very not...

3702
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:27,750
I don't look far ahead.

3703
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:29,550
So I only look, okay, what's
the next problem to solve,

3704
01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:30,900
and then the next problem?

3705
01:59:30,899 --> 01:59:33,779
And at the end, you have a whole app

3706
01:59:33,779 --> 01:59:35,819
or website or thing.

3707
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:39,677
But I think most people
look way too far ahead.

3708
01:59:39,677 --> 01:59:41,132
It's like this poster again.

3709
01:59:42,090 --> 01:59:43,050
You don't know hard it's gonna be,

3710
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:44,039
so you should only look like

3711
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:45,539
for the next thing,

3712
01:59:45,539 --> 01:59:47,189
the next little challenge, the next step.

3713
01:59:47,189 --> 01:59:48,989
And then see where you end up.

3714
01:59:48,989 --> 01:59:51,989
- And as assume it's
gonna be easy. (laughs)

3715
01:59:51,989 --> 01:59:52,822
- Yeah, exactly.

3716
01:59:52,823 --> 01:59:53,760
Be naive about it.

3717
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,523
Because you're gonna have
very difficult problems.

3718
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:59,159
A lot of the big problems
won't be even tech,

3719
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,210
will be like public, right?

3720
02:00:00,210 --> 02:00:02,435
Maybe people don't like your website.

3721
02:00:02,435 --> 02:00:04,950
You will get canceled for
a website, for example.

3722
02:00:04,949 --> 02:00:06,329
A lot of things can happen.

3723
02:00:06,329 --> 02:00:09,420
- What's it like building
in public, like you do?

3724
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:12,270
Openly, where you're
just iterating quickly

3725
02:00:12,270 --> 02:00:13,530
and you getting people feedback.

3726
02:00:13,529 --> 02:00:15,389
So there's the power of the crowdsourcing,

3727
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:17,481
but there's also the negative aspects

3728
02:00:17,481 --> 02:00:19,472
of people being able to criticize.

3729
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:22,170
- So man, I think haters
are actually good,

3730
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:24,368
'cause I think a lot of
haters have good points.

3731
02:00:24,368 --> 02:00:25,201
- Yeah.

3732
02:00:25,202 --> 02:00:27,900
- And it takes like stepping
away from the emotion of like,

3733
02:00:27,899 --> 02:00:30,479
ah, your website sucks
because blah, blah, blah.

3734
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:31,619
And you're like, okay, just remove this.

3735
02:00:31,619 --> 02:00:33,630
Your website sucks 'cause it's personal.

3736
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:34,462
What did he say?

3737
02:00:34,462 --> 02:00:35,399
Why did he didn't not like it?

3738
02:00:35,399 --> 02:00:36,839
And you figure out,
okay, he didn't like it

3739
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:39,010
'cause the signup was
difficult or something,

3740
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:40,440
or it wasn't the data.

3741
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:42,099
They say, no, this data is not
accurate or something, right?

3742
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,770
Okay, I need to improve
the quality of data.

3743
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:44,820
This hater has a point,

3744
02:00:44,819 --> 02:00:48,689
because it's dumb to
completely ignore your haters.

3745
02:00:48,689 --> 02:00:51,689
And also, man, I think I've been there

3746
02:00:51,689 --> 02:00:52,966
when I was like 10 years old or something.

3747
02:00:52,966 --> 02:00:55,409
You're on the internet
just shouting crazy stuff

3748
02:00:55,409 --> 02:00:56,699
that's like most of Twitter,

3749
02:00:56,699 --> 02:00:58,139
or the half Twitter.

3750
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:00,240
So you have to take it with grain of salt.

3751
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:04,560
Yeah, man, you need to
grow a very thick skin

3752
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:06,153
on Twitter, on X.

3753
02:01:07,590 --> 02:01:09,000
But I'm mute a lot of people.

3754
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,789
I found out I muted already 15,000 people

3755
02:01:11,789 --> 02:01:13,560
recently, I checked.

3756
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,780
So in 10 years, I muted 15,000 people.

3757
02:01:15,779 --> 02:01:17,686
So that's like-
- That's one by one manual.

3758
02:01:17,686 --> 02:01:19,349
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

3759
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:21,570
- So 1,500 people per year.

3760
02:01:21,569 --> 02:01:22,893
And I don't like to block,
'cause then they get angry,

3761
02:01:22,893 --> 02:01:25,529
they make a screenshot and
they say, ah, ah, you block me.

3762
02:01:25,529 --> 02:01:27,479
So I just mute and it disappear

3763
02:01:27,479 --> 02:01:29,149
and it's amazing.

3764
02:01:29,149 --> 02:01:30,750
- So you mentioned Reddit.

3765
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:34,662
So Hoodmaps, did that make it
to the front page of Reddit?

3766
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,469
- Yeah, yeah it did,
yeah, yeah, yeah it did.

3767
02:01:36,470 --> 02:01:37,619
It was amazing.

3768
02:01:37,619 --> 02:01:39,899
And my server almost went down,

3769
02:01:39,899 --> 02:01:41,009
and I was checking like Google Analytics

3770
02:01:41,010 --> 02:01:43,485
was like 5,000 people on the
website or something crazy.

3771
02:01:43,485 --> 02:01:45,435
And it was at night and it was amazing.

3772
02:01:47,250 --> 02:01:50,130
Man, I think nowadays, honestly, TikTok,

3773
02:01:50,130 --> 02:01:52,109
YouTube reels, Instagram reels.

3774
02:01:52,109 --> 02:01:55,079
A lot of apps get very big from people

3775
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:56,609
making TikTok videos about it.

3776
02:01:56,609 --> 02:01:59,159
So let's say you make your own app,

3777
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:00,146
you can make a video for yourself.

3778
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:01,979
Oh, I made this app.

3779
02:02:01,979 --> 02:02:04,169
This is how it works, blah, blah, blah.

3780
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:05,757
And this is why I made it, for example.

3781
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:07,439
And this is why you should use it.

3782
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:08,909
And if it's a good video, we'll take off,

3783
02:02:08,909 --> 02:02:13,800
and you will get, man, I got
like $20,000 extra per month

3784
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,960
or something from a TikTok
from one TikTok video.

3785
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:18,180
It made a Photo AI.

3786
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:20,250
- By you or somebody else?
- By some random guy.

3787
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:22,859
So there's all these AI
influencers that they write about.

3788
02:02:22,859 --> 02:02:25,559
They show AI apps and
then they ask money later,

3789
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,700
like when a video goes viral.

3790
02:02:26,699 --> 02:02:29,760
I can do it again, and send
me $4,000 or something.

3791
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,280
I'm like, okay, I did that, for example.

3792
02:02:32,279 --> 02:02:33,771
But it works.

3793
02:02:33,771 --> 02:02:37,533
TikTok is a very big platform
for user acquisition, yeah.

3794
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,770
And Organic, like the
best user acquisition

3795
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:41,970
I think is Organic.

3796
02:02:41,970 --> 02:02:42,840
You don't need to buy ads.

3797
02:02:42,840 --> 02:02:44,579
You probably don't have money
when you start to buy ads.

3798
02:02:44,579 --> 02:02:47,970
So use Organic or write
a banger, tweet, right?

3799
02:02:47,970 --> 02:02:50,358
That's can make an app take off as well.

3800
02:02:50,358 --> 02:02:52,440
- Well, I mean yeah,
fundamentally create cool stuff

3801
02:02:52,439 --> 02:02:55,289
and have just a little bit of a following

3802
02:02:55,289 --> 02:02:59,310
enough to like for the
cool thing to be noticed.

3803
02:02:59,310 --> 02:03:00,930
And then it becomes viral
if it's cool enough.

3804
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:03,090
- Yeah, and you don't need
a lot of followers anymore

3805
02:03:03,090 --> 02:03:04,650
on X and a lot of platforms

3806
02:03:04,649 --> 02:03:06,902
'cause TikTok X, I think in reels also,

3807
02:03:06,903 --> 02:03:08,463
they have the same algorithm now.

3808
02:03:08,462 --> 02:03:09,840
It's not about followers anymore,

3809
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,810
it's about they test your
content on a small subset,

3810
02:03:12,810 --> 02:03:14,070
like 300 people.

3811
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:15,210
If they like it,

3812
02:03:15,210 --> 02:03:17,760
it will gets tested to a
thousand people and on and on.

3813
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:20,610
So if the thing is good,
it will rise anyway.

3814
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:22,469
It doesn't matter if you
have half a million followers

3815
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:24,480
or a thousand followers or hundred.

3816
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:25,542
- What's your philosophy of monetizing

3817
02:03:25,542 --> 02:03:27,809
how to make money from
the thing you build?

3818
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:29,340
- Yeah, so a lot of starters,

3819
02:03:29,340 --> 02:03:30,510
they do like free users.

3820
02:03:30,510 --> 02:03:31,393
So you could sign up

3821
02:03:31,393 --> 02:03:33,649
and could use an app for free, which is...

3822
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:35,909
It never worked for me well,

3823
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:39,359
because I think free users
generally don't convert.

3824
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:40,942
And I think if you have VC funding,

3825
02:03:40,943 --> 02:03:42,930
it makes sense to get free users,

3826
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:44,490
because you can spend your funding on ads

3827
02:03:44,489 --> 02:03:47,130
and you can get like millions
of people come in predictably

3828
02:03:47,130 --> 02:03:48,480
how much they convert

3829
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:50,729
and give them like a free trial, whatever,

3830
02:03:50,729 --> 02:03:51,869
and then they sign up.

3831
02:03:51,869 --> 02:03:54,090
But you need to have that
flow worked out so well

3832
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:55,949
for you to make it work,
that you need like...

3833
02:03:55,949 --> 02:03:57,179
It's very difficult.

3834
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,230
I think it's best to start

3835
02:03:58,229 --> 02:04:00,329
and just start asking people

3836
02:04:00,329 --> 02:04:01,769
for money in the beginning.

3837
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:03,480
So show your app,

3838
02:04:03,479 --> 02:04:04,649
what are you doing on your landing page?

3839
02:04:04,649 --> 02:04:06,149
Make a demo or whatever video.

3840
02:04:06,149 --> 02:04:08,081
And then if you wanna
use it, pay me money,

3841
02:04:08,082 --> 02:04:10,650
pay $10, $20, $40.

3842
02:04:10,649 --> 02:04:12,869
I would ask more than $10 per month.

3843
02:04:12,869 --> 02:04:14,130
Netflix, like $10 per month.

3844
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:15,318
But Netflix is a giant company,

3845
02:04:15,318 --> 02:04:19,680
they can afford to make it
so cheap, relatively cheap.

3846
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,480
If you're an individual,
like an indie hacker,

3847
02:04:21,479 --> 02:04:23,279
you are making your own app.

3848
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:25,640
You need to make like at least $30

3849
02:04:25,640 --> 02:04:29,726
or more on a user to
make it worthy for you.

3850
02:04:29,726 --> 02:04:31,439
You need to make money.

3851
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:33,029
- And it builds a community of people

3852
02:04:33,029 --> 02:04:34,920
that actually really
care about the product.

3853
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:35,752
- Also, yeah.

3854
02:04:35,752 --> 02:04:37,769
Making a community, making
a discord very normal now.

3855
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:40,350
Every AI app has a discord
and you have the developers

3856
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:41,970
and the users together in a discord,

3857
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:43,050
and they talk about,

3858
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:44,340
they ask for features they build together.

3859
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,440
It is very normal now.

3860
02:04:46,734 --> 02:04:49,740
And you need to imagine
like if you're starting out,

3861
02:04:49,739 --> 02:04:52,529
getting a thousand users
is quite difficult,

3862
02:04:52,529 --> 02:04:53,849
getting a thousand pages
is quite difficult.

3863
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:56,389
And if you charge them like $30,

3864
02:04:56,389 --> 02:04:57,270
you have 30K a month,

3865
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:58,980
and it's a lot of money.

3866
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:01,229
- That's enough to like-
- Live a good life.

3867
02:05:01,229 --> 02:05:02,639
- Yeah, live a pretty good life.

3868
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,829
I mean that could be a lot of
costs associated with hosting.

3869
02:05:04,829 --> 02:05:06,029
- Yeah, so that's another thing.

3870
02:05:06,029 --> 02:05:07,889
I make sure my profit
margin are very high.

3871
02:05:07,890 --> 02:05:09,329
So I try to keep the cost very low.

3872
02:05:09,329 --> 02:05:10,502
I don't hire people.

3873
02:05:13,466 --> 02:05:15,360
I try to negotiate with AI vendors now,

3874
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:17,759
can you make it cheaper?

3875
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:20,039
I discovered this, you
can just email companies

3876
02:05:20,039 --> 02:05:22,470
and say, "Can you give me discount?

3877
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:23,460
It's too expensive."

3878
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:24,957
And they say, "Sure, 50%."

3879
02:05:24,957 --> 02:05:27,341
I'm like, "Wow, very good."
(Lex laughs)

3880
02:05:27,341 --> 02:05:29,220
And I didn't know this, you can just ask.

3881
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:32,130
And especially in like now
it's kind of recession,

3882
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:34,800
you can ask companies
like, I need a discount

3883
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,970
or I kind of need to like,

3884
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:37,170
you don't need to be asshole about it.

3885
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:39,000
Say, "I kind of need a discount

3886
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,859
or I need to go maybe to another company,

3887
02:05:40,859 --> 02:05:42,836
maybe discount here and there."

3888
02:05:42,837 --> 02:05:44,070
And they say, "Sure."

3889
02:05:44,069 --> 02:05:45,152
A lot of them will say yes.

3890
02:05:45,152 --> 02:05:47,831
Like 25% discount, 50% discounts,

3891
02:05:47,831 --> 02:05:49,980
'cause you think the price on the website

3892
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:51,539
is the price of the API or something.

3893
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:52,372
It's not.

3894
02:05:53,399 --> 02:05:56,219
- And also you're a public facing person.

3895
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,539
- Oh, that helps also.

3896
02:05:57,539 --> 02:05:58,710
- And there's love and good vibes

3897
02:05:58,710 --> 02:05:59,730
that you put out into the world.

3898
02:05:59,729 --> 02:06:00,629
You're actually legitimately

3899
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:02,640
trying to build cool stuff.

3900
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:05,369
So a lot of companies probably
wanna associate with you

3901
02:06:05,369 --> 02:06:06,501
because you're trying to do.

3902
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:07,710
- Yeah, it's like a secret hack,

3903
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:09,377
but I think even without-
- Secret hack.

3904
02:06:09,377 --> 02:06:10,210
Be a good person.

3905
02:06:10,211 --> 02:06:12,000
- It depends how much
discount they will give.

3906
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,319
They'll maybe give more,

3907
02:06:13,319 --> 02:06:15,299
but you know that's why
you should post on Twitter

3908
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,353
so you get discounts maybe.

3909
02:06:17,353 --> 02:06:19,409
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

3910
02:06:19,409 --> 02:06:20,762
- Yeah, yeah.

3911
02:06:21,806 --> 02:06:25,019
And also when it's crowdsourced,

3912
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:28,020
I mean paying does prevent spam

3913
02:06:28,020 --> 02:06:29,530
or help prevent spam.
- Also, yeah.

3914
02:06:29,529 --> 02:06:31,454
Yeah, it gives you high quality users.

3915
02:06:31,454 --> 02:06:34,260
- High quality users.
- Free users are sure,

3916
02:06:34,260 --> 02:06:35,220
but they're horrible.

3917
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,960
It's just like millions of people,

3918
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,760
especially with AI startups,
you get a lot of abuse.

3919
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,680
So you get millions of
people from anywhere

3920
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,940
just abusing your app,

3921
02:06:41,939 --> 02:06:44,519
just hacking it and whatever.

3922
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,050
- There's something on the internet.

3923
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:49,170
You mentioned like 4chan
discovered Hoodmaps.

3924
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:50,730
- Yeah, but I love 4chan.

3925
02:06:50,729 --> 02:06:51,562
I don't love 4chan,

3926
02:06:51,563 --> 02:06:52,980
but you know what I mean,
like they're so crazy,

3927
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:54,062
especially back then.

3928
02:06:55,739 --> 02:06:57,840
It's kind of funny what they do.

3929
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:00,029
- I actually, what is it?

3930
02:07:00,029 --> 02:07:02,729
This new documentary on
Netflix "Antisocial Network"

3931
02:07:02,729 --> 02:07:04,005
or something like that that was really-

3932
02:07:04,006 --> 02:07:04,950
- Interesting.
- Was fascinating.

3933
02:07:04,949 --> 02:07:05,782
Just 4chan,

3934
02:07:07,197 --> 02:07:09,247
the spirit of the thing, 4chan.

3935
02:07:09,247 --> 02:07:10,574
- And people just understand 4chan.

3936
02:07:10,573 --> 02:07:12,689
- It's so much about freedom

3937
02:07:12,689 --> 02:07:16,139
and also like the humor involved

3938
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:18,146
and fucking with the
system and fucking, man.

3939
02:07:18,145 --> 02:07:18,978
- That's it.

3940
02:07:18,979 --> 02:07:21,090
It's just anti-system for fun.

3941
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:25,650
- The dark aspect of it
is you're having fun,

3942
02:07:25,649 --> 02:07:27,899
you're doing anti-system stuff,

3943
02:07:27,899 --> 02:07:30,239
but like the Nazis always show up

3944
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:31,469
and it somehow-
- Really bad shit

3945
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,710
started happening.
- It drifting somehow, yeah.

3946
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:34,949
- It like school shootings and stuff.

3947
02:07:34,949 --> 02:07:37,139
So it's a very difficult topic,

3948
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:40,230
but I do know, especially early on,

3949
02:07:40,229 --> 02:07:42,479
I think 2010, I would go to 4chan for fun,

3950
02:07:42,479 --> 02:07:44,579
and they would post crazy offensive stuff.

3951
02:07:44,579 --> 02:07:46,485
And this was just to scare off people.

3952
02:07:46,485 --> 02:07:47,346
So we show to other people say,

3953
02:07:47,346 --> 02:07:48,782
"Hey, do you know this
internet website 4chan?

3954
02:07:48,783 --> 02:07:50,340
Just check it out."
- Yeah. (laughs)

3955
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,630
- And they'd be, "Dude,
what the fuck is that?"

3956
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:53,069
I'm like, no, no, you don't understand.

3957
02:07:53,069 --> 02:07:54,299
- Yeah.
- That's to scare you away.

3958
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:55,710
But actually when you go through scroll,

3959
02:07:55,710 --> 02:07:56,880
there's like deep conversations.

3960
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,920
- Yes.
- And they would already be,

3961
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:00,090
this was like a normie filter,

3962
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:01,800
like to stop.
- Yeah.

3963
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:02,632
- So kind of cool.

3964
02:08:02,632 --> 02:08:04,199
But yeah-
- It goes dark.

3965
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:05,369
- It goes dark, yeah.

3966
02:08:05,369 --> 02:08:07,829
- And if you have those people show up,

3967
02:08:07,829 --> 02:08:09,989
for the fun of it, do a
bunch of racist things

3968
02:08:09,989 --> 02:08:10,822
and all that kind of
stuff you were saying.

3969
02:08:10,823 --> 02:08:11,820
- Yeah, but everything is,

3970
02:08:11,819 --> 02:08:12,929
I think it was never,

3971
02:08:12,929 --> 02:08:13,761
man, I'm not at 4chan,

3972
02:08:13,761 --> 02:08:15,929
but it was always about provoking.

3973
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:17,550
It's just provocateur.

3974
02:08:17,550 --> 02:08:19,920
- But the provoking in
the case of Hoodmaps

3975
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:21,210
or something like this can-
- Oh, man.

3976
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:22,042
- Can damage

3977
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:27,720
a good thing like (laughs)

3978
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:29,640
a little poison in a town is always good.

3979
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,079
It's like the Tom Waits thing,

3980
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:32,430
but you don't want too much

3981
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:34,230
otherwise it destroys the town.

3982
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:35,062
It destroys the thing.

3983
02:08:35,063 --> 02:08:36,420
- Yeah, they're kind like pen testers,

3984
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:37,350
like penetration testers,

3985
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:38,190
hackers.
- Yeah.

3986
02:08:38,189 --> 02:08:39,960
- They just test your app for you

3987
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:40,920
and then you add some stuff,

3988
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:45,119
like I add like a NSFW word list.

3989
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,170
They would say like bad words.

3990
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:48,930
So when they would write like a bad words,

3991
02:08:48,930 --> 02:08:50,520
they would get forwarded to YouTube,

3992
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:51,630
which was like a video.

3993
02:08:51,630 --> 02:08:55,739
It was like a very relaxing
video that like kind of ASMR

3994
02:08:55,739 --> 02:08:59,729
with like glowing jelly streaming
like this to relax them,

3995
02:08:59,729 --> 02:09:01,370
or cheese melting on the toast.

3996
02:09:01,371 --> 02:09:02,307
- Cheese melting, nice.

3997
02:09:02,307 --> 02:09:03,922
- And to chill them out.
- Yeah, yeah.

3998
02:09:03,922 --> 02:09:05,331
- I like it.
- Yeah.

3999
02:09:05,331 --> 02:09:07,230
- But actually a lot of
stuff I didn't realize

4000
02:09:07,229 --> 02:09:10,436
how much originated in
4chan in terms of memes.

4001
02:09:10,436 --> 02:09:12,072
Rickroll, I didn't understand.

4002
02:09:12,072 --> 02:09:13,703
I did not know that
Rickroll originated 4chan.

4003
02:09:13,703 --> 02:09:15,643
- Really?
- There's so many memes,

4004
02:09:15,643 --> 02:09:17,230
like most of the memes that you think-

4005
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:19,079
- The word roll I think comes from 4chan,

4006
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:21,059
like not the word roll, but in this case,

4007
02:09:21,060 --> 02:09:22,440
in the meme use.
- Yeah.

4008
02:09:22,439 --> 02:09:24,210
- You would get like roll doubles,

4009
02:09:24,210 --> 02:09:27,029
'cause there was like post IDs on 4chan.

4010
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:29,069
So they were kinda like random.

4011
02:09:29,069 --> 02:09:31,829
So if I get doubles, this
happens or something.

4012
02:09:31,829 --> 02:09:33,869
So you'd get like two, two.

4013
02:09:33,869 --> 02:09:36,149
Anyway, it's like a betting
market kind of on these doubles,

4014
02:09:36,149 --> 02:09:38,909
on these post IDs, this
so much funny stuff.

4015
02:09:38,909 --> 02:09:41,430
- Yeah, I mean that's the
internet, that's purist.

4016
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:43,694
But yeah, again, the dark
stuff kind of seeps in.

4017
02:09:43,694 --> 02:09:44,527
- [Pieter] Yeah.

4018
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:49,199
- It's nice to keep the dark
stuff to some low amount.

4019
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,239
It's nice to have a bit
of noise of the darkness,

4020
02:09:51,239 --> 02:09:53,039
but not too much.
- Yeah.

4021
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:55,922
- But again, you have to
pay attention to that with,

4022
02:09:56,838 --> 02:09:58,229
I mean I guess spam in general.

4023
02:09:58,229 --> 02:10:00,149
You have to fight that with Nomad List.

4024
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:01,439
How do you fight spam?

4025
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:02,729
- Man, I use GPT-4 now.

4026
02:10:02,729 --> 02:10:03,562
It's amazing.

4027
02:10:03,563 --> 02:10:08,310
(laughs) So I have like
user input have reviews,

4028
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:09,420
people can review cities.

4029
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:10,680
And I don't need to actually sign up.

4030
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:12,180
It's anonymous reviews.

4031
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:14,220
And they write whole books about cities

4032
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:15,690
and what's good and bad.

4033
02:10:15,689 --> 02:10:18,176
So I run into GPT-4 now,

4034
02:10:18,176 --> 02:10:21,449
and I ask like, "Is this a good review?

4035
02:10:21,449 --> 02:10:22,349
Is this offensive?

4036
02:10:22,350 --> 02:10:23,966
Is this race is this or some stuff?"

4037
02:10:23,966 --> 02:10:26,640
And then send me message on Telegram

4038
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:28,320
when it rejects reviews and I check it,

4039
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:30,509
and man, it's so on point.

4040
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:31,980
It's so-
- Automated.

4041
02:10:31,979 --> 02:10:33,419
- Yes, and it's so accurate.

4042
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:35,012
It understands double meanings.

4043
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:39,239
I have GPT-4 running
on the chat community.

4044
02:10:39,239 --> 02:10:40,947
It's a chat community of 10,000 people,

4045
02:10:40,947 --> 02:10:41,880
and they're chatting,

4046
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:44,451
and they start fighting with each other.

4047
02:10:44,451 --> 02:10:47,609
And I used to have human
moderators was very good,

4048
02:10:47,609 --> 02:10:49,469
but they would start
fighting the human moderator.

4049
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:51,300
This guy's biased or something.

4050
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:52,350
I have GPT-4.

4051
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:55,590
And it's really, really,
really, really good.

4052
02:10:55,590 --> 02:10:56,610
It understands humor.

4053
02:10:56,609 --> 02:10:59,729
It understands like you
could say something bad,

4054
02:10:59,729 --> 02:11:00,659
but it's kinda a joke,

4055
02:11:00,659 --> 02:11:02,622
and it's kind of not offensive so much,

4056
02:11:02,622 --> 02:11:04,385
so it shouldn't be deleted, right?

4057
02:11:04,386 --> 02:11:05,673
It understands that.

4058
02:11:06,837 --> 02:11:11,139
- I would love to have
a GPT-4 based filter

4059
02:11:12,563 --> 02:11:15,510
of different kinds for like X.

4060
02:11:15,510 --> 02:11:16,619
- Yeah, I thought this week like,

4061
02:11:16,619 --> 02:11:18,420
I tweeted like a fact check.

4062
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:20,377
You can click Fact Check and then GPT-4.

4063
02:11:20,377 --> 02:11:22,980
Look, GPT-4 is not always
right about stuff, right?

4064
02:11:22,979 --> 02:11:26,909
But it can give you a general
fact check on a tweet.

4065
02:11:26,909 --> 02:11:28,800
Usually, what I do now
when I write something like

4066
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,050
difficult about economics
or something about AI.

4067
02:11:31,050 --> 02:11:32,476
I put in GPT-4 say,
"Can you fact check it?"

4068
02:11:32,476 --> 02:11:34,949
'Cause I might have said something stupid.

4069
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:37,859
And the stupid stuff always
gets taken out by the replies.

4070
02:11:37,859 --> 02:11:39,064
Oh, you said this wrong.

4071
02:11:39,064 --> 02:11:40,199
And then the whole tweet

4072
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:41,279
kind of doesn't make sense anymore.

4073
02:11:41,279 --> 02:11:44,859
So I ask GPT-4 the fact
check a lot of stuff.

4074
02:11:44,859 --> 02:11:46,380
- So fact check is a tough one.

4075
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:47,212
- Yeah.

4076
02:11:47,212 --> 02:11:48,579
- But it would be interesting to sort of

4077
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:53,880
rate a thing based on how
well-thought out it is

4078
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,619
and how well-argued it is.

4079
02:11:55,619 --> 02:11:57,932
- Yeah.
- That seems more doable.

4080
02:11:57,932 --> 02:11:59,369
That seems like more doable.

4081
02:11:59,369 --> 02:12:00,569
It seems like a GPT thing

4082
02:12:00,569 --> 02:12:02,279
because that that's less about the truth

4083
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:04,050
and it's more about
the rigor of the thing.

4084
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:05,369
- Exactly, and you can ask that,

4085
02:12:05,369 --> 02:12:07,619
you can ask in the prompt like,

4086
02:12:07,619 --> 02:12:09,466
I don't know, for example, do you think...

4087
02:12:09,466 --> 02:12:12,750
Create like a ranking
score for X Twitter applies

4088
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:16,199
where I should dispose
be, if we rank on like,

4089
02:12:16,199 --> 02:12:18,059
I dunno, integrity, reality,

4090
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:20,430
like fundamental deepness or something,

4091
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:21,990
interestingness.

4092
02:12:21,989 --> 02:12:24,779
And it will give you with a
pretty good score probably.

4093
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:26,750
I mean Elon can do this with Grok, right?

4094
02:12:26,750 --> 02:12:30,720
He can start using that to check replies,

4095
02:12:30,720 --> 02:12:32,640
because the reply section is like chaos.

4096
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,987
- Yeah, and actually the ranking

4097
02:12:33,987 --> 02:12:34,819
and the replies is not great.

4098
02:12:34,819 --> 02:12:36,539
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Doesn't make sense.

4099
02:12:36,539 --> 02:12:38,699
- No.
- And I would like to sort

4100
02:12:38,699 --> 02:12:39,929
in different kinds of ways.

4101
02:12:39,930 --> 02:12:41,253
- Yeah, and you get too many replies now,

4102
02:12:41,253 --> 02:12:42,269
if you have a lot of followers.

4103
02:12:42,270 --> 02:12:43,103
I get too many replies.

4104
02:12:43,103 --> 02:12:43,935
I don't see everything

4105
02:12:43,935 --> 02:12:47,069
and a lot of stuff I just miss

4106
02:12:47,069 --> 02:12:49,079
and I wanna see the good stuff.

4107
02:12:49,079 --> 02:12:51,439
- And also the notifications or whatever,

4108
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:53,250
is just complete chaos.
- Yeah.

4109
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:55,079
- It'd be nice to be able to filter that

4110
02:12:55,079 --> 02:12:55,912
in interesting ways,

4111
02:12:55,912 --> 02:12:57,272
sorted in interesting ways.

4112
02:12:58,649 --> 02:13:00,689
'Cause I feel like I miss a lot

4113
02:13:00,689 --> 02:13:04,889
and what's surfaced for me
is just a random comment

4114
02:13:04,890 --> 02:13:06,640
by a person with no followers.

4115
02:13:06,640 --> 02:13:08,113
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's positive or negative.

4116
02:13:08,113 --> 02:13:09,570
It's like, okay,

4117
02:13:09,569 --> 02:13:11,219
- If it's a very good
comment, it should happen,

4118
02:13:11,220 --> 02:13:13,829
but it should probably
look a little bit more,

4119
02:13:13,829 --> 02:13:14,819
do these people have followers,

4120
02:13:14,819 --> 02:13:17,154
'cause they're probably more
engaged in the platform, right?

4121
02:13:17,154 --> 02:13:18,420
- Oh, no.

4122
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,920
I don't even care about
how many followers.

4123
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:22,649
If you're ranking by the
quality of the comment, great.

4124
02:13:22,649 --> 02:13:24,929
- Yeah.
- But not just randomly,

4125
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:27,900
like chronological,
just a sea of comments.

4126
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:29,819
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does make sense.

4127
02:13:29,819 --> 02:13:31,259
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

4128
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:33,570
X could be very proof of that, I think.

4129
02:13:33,569 --> 02:13:35,639
- One thing you espouse a lot,

4130
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,730
which I love is the automation step.

4131
02:13:38,729 --> 02:13:40,739
So once you have a thing...

4132
02:13:40,739 --> 02:13:42,286
Once you have an idea and you build it,

4133
02:13:42,287 --> 02:13:44,850
and it actually starts making money.

4134
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:46,470
And it's making people happy,

4135
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:49,230
there's a community of people using it.

4136
02:13:49,229 --> 02:13:51,689
You want to take the automation step

4137
02:13:51,689 --> 02:13:54,029
of automating the things you
have to do as little work

4138
02:13:54,029 --> 02:13:55,568
as possible for it to
keep running indefinitely.

4139
02:13:55,569 --> 02:13:58,230
- Yeah.
- Can you explain

4140
02:13:58,229 --> 02:13:59,062
your philosophy there?

4141
02:13:59,063 --> 02:14:00,930
What do you mean by automate?

4142
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:03,180
- Yeah, so the general
theory of starters would be

4143
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:05,579
that when it starts,
you start making money,

4144
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:07,289
you start hiring people
to do stuff, right?

4145
02:14:07,289 --> 02:14:08,970
Do stuff that you, like
marketing, for example.

4146
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:12,119
Do stuff that you would do
in the beginning yourself,

4147
02:14:12,119 --> 02:14:14,279
and whatever community management

4148
02:14:14,279 --> 02:14:16,529
and organizing meetups for
Nomad List, for example,

4149
02:14:16,529 --> 02:14:18,659
that would be a job, for example.

4150
02:14:18,659 --> 02:14:21,869
And I felt like I don't
have the money for that

4151
02:14:21,869 --> 02:14:24,840
and I don't really wanna run a big company

4152
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:25,672
with a lot of people,

4153
02:14:25,672 --> 02:14:27,840
'cause there's a lot of
work managing these people.

4154
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,670
So I've always tried to
automate these things

4155
02:14:29,670 --> 02:14:31,023
as much as possible.

4156
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:35,043
And this can literally
be like for Nomad List,

4157
02:14:35,042 --> 02:14:36,389
it's literally like a...

4158
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:37,222
It's not a different other sources.

4159
02:14:37,222 --> 02:14:38,220
It was like a webpage

4160
02:14:38,220 --> 02:14:39,354
where you can organize your own meetup,

4161
02:14:39,354 --> 02:14:42,030
set a schedule, a date, whatever.

4162
02:14:42,029 --> 02:14:44,279
You could see how many nomads
will be there at that date.

4163
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:47,699
So there will be actually
enough nomads to meet up, right?

4164
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,559
And then when it's done,

4165
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,083
it sends a tweet out on
the Nomad List account.

4166
02:14:51,082 --> 02:14:52,949
There's a meetup here.

4167
02:14:52,949 --> 02:14:55,529
It sends a direct message
to everybody in the city

4168
02:14:55,529 --> 02:14:57,269
who are there, who are gonna be there.

4169
02:14:57,270 --> 02:14:59,400
And then people show up on
a bar and there's a meetup

4170
02:14:59,399 --> 02:15:01,019
and that's fully automated.

4171
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:04,770
And for me, it's so obvious
to make this automatic,

4172
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:07,653
why would you have somebody organize this?

4173
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,140
It makes more sense to automate it.

4174
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:11,340
And with most of my things,

4175
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:14,579
like I figure out how to do it with codes.

4176
02:15:14,579 --> 02:15:16,260
And I think especially now with AI,

4177
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:18,659
you can automate so much
more stuff than before.

4178
02:15:18,659 --> 02:15:21,059
'Cause AI understands things so well.

4179
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:22,920
Like before I would use
if statements, right?

4180
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,930
Now you ask GPT, you
put something on GPT-4,

4181
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:27,659
and in the API and it sends back like,

4182
02:15:27,659 --> 02:15:29,010
this is good, this is bad.

4183
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:31,000
- Yeah, so you basically can now even

4184
02:15:31,979 --> 02:15:34,609
automate sort of
subjective type of things.

4185
02:15:34,609 --> 02:15:36,206
This is the difference now.
- Yeah.

4186
02:15:36,207 --> 02:15:38,039
- And that's very recent, right?

4187
02:15:38,039 --> 02:15:39,750
- But it's still difficult to,

4188
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:42,029
I mean that's step of
automation is difficult

4189
02:15:42,029 --> 02:15:45,599
to figure out how to...

4190
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,520
Is you're basically
delegating everything to code.

4191
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:48,353
- Yeah.

4192
02:15:48,353 --> 02:15:49,380
- And it's not trivial to take

4193
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:51,720
that step for a lot of people.

4194
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:53,039
So when you say automate,

4195
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:56,189
are you talking about like CronJob?

4196
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:57,611
- Yes, man, a lot of CronJob.

4197
02:15:57,612 --> 02:16:00,630
- A lot of CronJobs.
- Yeah.

4198
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:02,310
- I literally, I log into the server

4199
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:05,190
and I do like sudo crontab-e,

4200
02:16:05,189 --> 02:16:06,149
and then I go into editor

4201
02:16:06,149 --> 02:16:07,920
and I write like hourly

4202
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:08,970
and then I write PHP,

4203
02:16:11,247 --> 02:16:14,099
dothisthing.php, and that's a script.

4204
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:17,130
And that script does a thing
and it does it then hourly.

4205
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:17,962
That's it.

4206
02:16:17,962 --> 02:16:19,199
And that's how all my websites work.

4207
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:20,729
- Do you have a thing where it like

4208
02:16:20,729 --> 02:16:22,019
emails you or something like this?

4209
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:23,640
Or emails somebody managing the thing,

4210
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,200
if something goes wrong?

4211
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:26,519
- I have these webpage that make,

4212
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,200
they're called like healthchecks.

4213
02:16:28,199 --> 02:16:29,970
It's like healthcheck.php,

4214
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:31,847
and then it has emojis,

4215
02:16:31,847 --> 02:16:33,959
it has a green check mark if it's good,

4216
02:16:33,959 --> 02:16:35,729
and a read one if it's bad.

4217
02:16:35,729 --> 02:16:37,799
And then it does like
database cures, for example.

4218
02:16:37,799 --> 02:16:41,332
Like what's the internet speed
in, for example, Amsterdam.

4219
02:16:41,333 --> 02:16:42,266
Okay, it's a number.

4220
02:16:42,266 --> 02:16:43,889
It's like 27 point megabits.

4221
02:16:43,889 --> 02:16:45,239
So it's accurate number.

4222
02:16:45,239 --> 02:16:46,110
Okay, check, good.

4223
02:16:46,110 --> 02:16:46,943
And it goes to the next,

4224
02:16:46,942 --> 02:16:49,229
and it goes on all the data points.

4225
02:16:49,229 --> 02:16:51,270
Did people sign up in it last 24 hours?

4226
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:53,190
It's important 'cause
maybe the sign up broke.

4227
02:16:53,190 --> 02:16:54,569
Okay, check, somebody sign up.

4228
02:16:54,569 --> 02:16:56,879
Then I have uptimerobot.com,

4229
02:16:56,879 --> 02:16:57,899
which is like for Uptime,

4230
02:16:57,899 --> 02:16:59,190
but it can also check keywords.

4231
02:16:59,190 --> 02:17:00,840
It checks for an emoji,

4232
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:02,909
which is like the red X,

4233
02:17:02,909 --> 02:17:04,770
which is if something is bad.

4234
02:17:04,770 --> 02:17:07,380
And so it opens that health
check page every minute

4235
02:17:07,379 --> 02:17:08,259
to check if something's bad.

4236
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:09,540
Then if it's bad,

4237
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:11,640
it sends a message to me on Telegram

4238
02:17:11,639 --> 02:17:12,979
saying, "Hey, what's up?"

4239
02:17:12,979 --> 02:17:14,100
Or it doesn't say, "Hey, what's up?"

4240
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,270
It sends me like alert.
(Lex laughs)

4241
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:16,470
- Hey, hey, sweetie.

4242
02:17:16,469 --> 02:17:17,879
- This thing is down and then I check.

4243
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:20,339
So within a minute of something breaking,

4244
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:22,950
I know it and then I can
open my laptop and fix it.

4245
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:24,210
- Yeah.
- But the good thing is

4246
02:17:24,209 --> 02:17:26,789
like the last few years,
things don't break anymore.

4247
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:29,430
And definitely 10 years
ago, when I started,

4248
02:17:29,430 --> 02:17:31,530
everything was breaking all the time.

4249
02:17:31,530 --> 02:17:33,210
And now it's like almost,

4250
02:17:33,209 --> 02:17:37,259
last week was like a 100.000% Uptime.

4251
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,450
And these health checks are
part of the Uptime percentage.

4252
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:41,147
So it's like everything works.

4253
02:17:41,147 --> 02:17:42,780
- You're actually making me realize

4254
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:46,230
I should have a page for myself.

4255
02:17:46,229 --> 02:17:49,949
Like one page that has
all the healthchecks,

4256
02:17:49,950 --> 02:17:50,850
just so I can go to it

4257
02:17:50,850 --> 02:17:52,334
and see all the green check marks.

4258
02:17:52,334 --> 02:17:53,670
- It feels good to look at, you know.

4259
02:17:53,670 --> 02:17:55,200
- It just be like, okay.
- Yeah.

4260
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,120
- All right, we're okay.

4261
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,020
Everything's okay.
- Yeah.

4262
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:59,670
- And like you can see like,

4263
02:17:59,670 --> 02:18:01,799
when was the last time
something wasn't okay,

4264
02:18:01,799 --> 02:18:04,529
and it'll say like never.
- Yeah.

4265
02:18:04,530 --> 02:18:07,320
- Or meaning like you've checked

4266
02:18:07,319 --> 02:18:11,010
since you've last cared to
check, it's all been okay.

4267
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:11,843
- For sure.

4268
02:18:11,843 --> 02:18:13,829
It used to send me the good healthchecks.

4269
02:18:13,829 --> 02:18:16,079
- Yeah.
- It all works, it all works.

4270
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:17,070
- But it's been-
- It all works.

4271
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:18,521
- [Lex] So often. (laughs)

4272
02:18:18,521 --> 02:18:19,409
- And I'm like, this feels so good.

4273
02:18:19,409 --> 02:18:20,903
But then I'm like, okay,
obviously, it's not gonna,

4274
02:18:20,903 --> 02:18:23,489
we need to hide the good ones
and show only the bad ones,

4275
02:18:23,489 --> 02:18:24,323
and now that's the case.

4276
02:18:24,323 --> 02:18:26,760
- I need to integrate
everything into one place.

4277
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:29,130
I automate like everything.
- Yeah, yeah.

4278
02:18:29,129 --> 02:18:32,909
- Also just a large set of CronJob.

4279
02:18:32,909 --> 02:18:36,389
A lot of the publication of
this podcast is done all,

4280
02:18:36,389 --> 02:18:37,889
everything's just on automatically,

4281
02:18:37,889 --> 02:18:38,722
it's all clipped up.

4282
02:18:38,722 --> 02:18:41,350
All this kind of stuff.
- Wow, yeah.

4283
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:42,930
- But it would be nice
to automate even more.

4284
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:44,819
- Yeah.
- Like translation,

4285
02:18:44,819 --> 02:18:46,469
all this kind of stuff
would be nice to automate.

4286
02:18:46,469 --> 02:18:47,496
- Yeah, every JavaScript,

4287
02:18:47,496 --> 02:18:50,189
every PHP error gets sent
to my Telegram as well.

4288
02:18:50,190 --> 02:18:52,409
So every user, whatever user it is,

4289
02:18:52,409 --> 02:18:53,969
doesn't have to be page user.

4290
02:18:53,969 --> 02:18:55,322
If they run into a error,

4291
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:59,820
the JavaScript sends the
JavaScript error to the server

4292
02:18:59,819 --> 02:19:04,110
and then it sends to my
Telegram, from all my websites.

4293
02:19:04,110 --> 02:19:05,880
- So you get like a message.

4294
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:08,339
- So I get like a uncut, variable error,

4295
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:09,281
whatever, blah, blah, blah.

4296
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:10,500
And then I'm like, "Okay, interesting."

4297
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:12,059
And then I go check it out.

4298
02:19:12,059 --> 02:19:13,739
And that's like a way
to get to zero errors,

4299
02:19:13,739 --> 02:19:16,170
'cause you get flooded with
errors in the beginning,

4300
02:19:16,170 --> 02:19:18,063
and now it's like nothing almost.

4301
02:19:19,139 --> 02:19:20,250
- So that's really cool.

4302
02:19:20,250 --> 02:19:21,719
That's really cool.

4303
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:23,702
- But this is the same stuff people,

4304
02:19:23,702 --> 02:19:27,149
they pay like very big SaaS companies.

4305
02:19:27,149 --> 02:19:28,889
New Relic for right?

4306
02:19:28,889 --> 02:19:30,809
To manage this stuff.

4307
02:19:30,809 --> 02:19:31,643
So you can do that too.

4308
02:19:31,643 --> 02:19:32,476
You can use off the shelf.

4309
02:19:32,476 --> 02:19:33,420
I like to build myself.

4310
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:34,920
It's easier.
- Yeah, it's nice.

4311
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:37,379
It's nice to do that kind of automation.

4312
02:19:37,379 --> 02:19:38,459
I'm starting to think of like,

4313
02:19:38,459 --> 02:19:39,479
what are the things in my life

4314
02:19:39,479 --> 02:19:41,479
I'm doing myself that could be automated

4315
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:43,433
in addition.

4316
02:19:43,433 --> 02:19:45,810
- You can ask GPT, give
your daily your day

4317
02:19:45,809 --> 02:19:48,119
and then ask you what
parts you to automate.

4318
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:50,370
- Well, one of the things I
would love to automate more

4319
02:19:50,370 --> 02:19:51,959
is my consumption and social media.

4320
02:19:51,959 --> 02:19:52,792
- [Pieter] Yeah.

4321
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:55,799
- Both the output and the input.

4322
02:19:55,799 --> 02:19:57,959
- Man, I think there's
some startups that do that.

4323
02:19:57,959 --> 02:20:01,472
They summarize the cool
shit happening on Twitter,

4324
02:20:01,472 --> 02:20:06,120
with AI, I think the guy
called SWYX or something,

4325
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:09,090
he does like a newsletter
that's completely AI generated.

4326
02:20:09,090 --> 02:20:11,579
We have the cool new stuff in AI.

4327
02:20:11,579 --> 02:20:13,139
- Yeah, I mean I would love to do that.

4328
02:20:13,139 --> 02:20:15,171
But also like across Instagram, Facebook-

4329
02:20:15,171 --> 02:20:16,195
- Yeah.
- LinkedIn.

4330
02:20:16,195 --> 02:20:17,789
- Yeah.
- All this kind of stuff.

4331
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:19,186
Just like, okay,

4332
02:20:19,185 --> 02:20:20,959
can you summarize the internet for me

4333
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:22,079
(Pieter chuckles)
For today?

4334
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:24,389
- Summarize internet.com.
- Yeah, dot com.

4335
02:20:24,389 --> 02:20:25,829
- Yeah.
- Because I feel like

4336
02:20:25,829 --> 02:20:29,520
it pulls into way too much time,

4337
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,770
but also like, I don't
like the effect it has

4338
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:33,690
some days on my psyche.

4339
02:20:33,690 --> 02:20:34,860
- Because of like haters

4340
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:36,165
or just general content and politics?

4341
02:20:36,165 --> 02:20:36,998
- Just general.

4342
02:20:36,997 --> 02:20:38,609
No, no, just general.

4343
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:41,909
Like for example, TikTok is a
good example of that for me.

4344
02:20:41,909 --> 02:20:44,760
I sometimes just feel
dumber after I use TikTok.

4345
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:45,593
I just feel like-

4346
02:20:45,593 --> 02:20:46,426
- [Pieter] Yeah, I don't use it anymore.

4347
02:20:46,425 --> 02:20:49,895
- Empty somehow and I'm like uninspired.

4348
02:20:49,896 --> 02:20:51,630
- Yeah.
- It's funny

4349
02:20:51,629 --> 02:20:52,469
in the moment I'm like,

4350
02:20:52,469 --> 02:20:55,199
ha-ha, look at that cat
doing a funny thing.

4351
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:56,033
And then you're like,

4352
02:20:56,032 --> 02:20:57,449
oh, look at that person dancing

4353
02:20:57,450 --> 02:20:59,970
in a funny way to that music.

4354
02:20:59,969 --> 02:21:01,170
And then you're like,

4355
02:21:01,170 --> 02:21:03,960
10 minutes later you're
like, I feel way dumber

4356
02:21:03,959 --> 02:21:05,076
and I don't really wanna do much.

4357
02:21:05,076 --> 02:21:06,750
- Yeah.
- For the rest of the day.

4358
02:21:06,750 --> 02:21:07,680
- My girlfriend said,

4359
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:10,050
she saw me like watching some dumb video.

4360
02:21:10,049 --> 02:21:11,945
She's like, "Dude, your
face looks so dumb as well."

4361
02:21:11,945 --> 02:21:12,779
(Lex laughs)

4362
02:21:12,779 --> 02:21:15,210
Your whole face starts
going like, oh, interesting.

4363
02:21:17,215 --> 02:21:19,170
- I mean with social media,

4364
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:21,365
with X sometimes for me too,

4365
02:21:21,365 --> 02:21:23,129
I think I'm probably naturally

4366
02:21:23,129 --> 02:21:25,289
gravitating towards the drama.

4367
02:21:25,290 --> 02:21:26,970
- Yeah, hard wheel.

4368
02:21:26,969 --> 02:21:29,639
- Yeah, and so with following AI people,

4369
02:21:29,639 --> 02:21:31,889
especially AI people that
only post technical content

4370
02:21:31,889 --> 02:21:32,722
and it's been really good,

4371
02:21:32,722 --> 02:21:34,379
'cause then I just look at them,

4372
02:21:34,379 --> 02:21:36,449
and then I go on down rabbit holes

4373
02:21:36,450 --> 02:21:38,280
of like learning new papers
that have been published

4374
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:39,239
or-
- Yeah.

4375
02:21:39,239 --> 02:21:40,073
- Git repos,

4376
02:21:40,073 --> 02:21:44,309
or just any kind of cool
demonstration of stuff

4377
02:21:44,309 --> 02:21:46,170
and the kind of things that they retweet.

4378
02:21:46,170 --> 02:21:48,030
And that's the rabbit
hole I go and I'm learning

4379
02:21:48,030 --> 02:21:50,079
and I'm inspired, all that kind of stuff.

4380
02:21:51,266 --> 02:21:52,100
But it's been tough.

4381
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:52,933
It's been tough to control that.

4382
02:21:52,933 --> 02:21:53,766
- It's difficult.

4383
02:21:53,765 --> 02:21:56,100
You need to like manage your platforms.

4384
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:57,409
I have a mute board list as well,

4385
02:21:57,409 --> 02:21:58,967
so I mute like politics stuff,

4386
02:21:58,967 --> 02:22:01,620
'cause I don't really want it on my feed.

4387
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:05,280
And I think I've muted so
much that now my feed is good.

4388
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,661
I see interesting stuff,
(Lex laughs)

4389
02:22:07,661 --> 02:22:09,870
but the fact that you need to modify,

4390
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:11,700
you need to like mod your app,

4391
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,533
your social media platform-
- Yeah.

4392
02:22:12,532 --> 02:22:14,969
- Just to function and
not be toxic for you,

4393
02:22:14,969 --> 02:22:16,379
for your mental health, right?

4394
02:22:16,379 --> 02:22:17,219
That's like a problem.

4395
02:22:17,219 --> 02:22:18,779
It should be doing that for you.

4396
02:22:18,780 --> 02:22:20,800
- It's some level of automation

4397
02:22:21,690 --> 02:22:22,800
that would be interesting.

4398
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:27,799
I wish I could access X and
Instagram through API easier.

4399
02:22:27,959 --> 02:22:30,389
- You need to spend $42,000 a month,

4400
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:31,739
which my friends do.

4401
02:22:31,739 --> 02:22:32,573
Yeah, you can do that.

4402
02:22:32,573 --> 02:22:33,690
- But still, even if you do that,

4403
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:35,430
that you're not getting,

4404
02:22:35,430 --> 02:22:36,569
I mean there's limitations

4405
02:22:36,569 --> 02:22:38,369
that don't make it easy to do like-

4406
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:39,990
- Yeah.
- Automate.

4407
02:22:39,989 --> 02:22:41,430
The thing that they're trying to limit,

4408
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:44,069
like abuse or for you
to steal all the data

4409
02:22:44,069 --> 02:22:45,989
from the app to then train an LLM,

4410
02:22:45,989 --> 02:22:46,829
or something like this.
- Yeah.

4411
02:22:46,829 --> 02:22:49,559
- But if I just wanna figure out ways

4412
02:22:49,559 --> 02:22:52,619
to automate my interaction
with the X system,

4413
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:55,710
or with Instagram, they
don't make that easy.

4414
02:22:55,709 --> 02:22:57,299
But I would love to sort of automate that

4415
02:22:57,299 --> 02:22:59,625
and explore different ways
to how to leverage LLMs

4416
02:22:59,625 --> 02:23:02,819
to control the content I consume,

4417
02:23:02,819 --> 02:23:04,500
and maybe publish that

4418
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:06,329
and maybe they themselves can see how

4419
02:23:06,329 --> 02:23:07,789
that could be used to
improve their system.

4420
02:23:07,789 --> 02:23:08,622
- Yeah.

4421
02:23:08,621 --> 02:23:10,909
- But there's not enough access.

4422
02:23:10,909 --> 02:23:13,440
- Yes, if you could screen
cap your phone, right?

4423
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:16,440
It could be an app that
watches your screen with you.

4424
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:17,273
- You could, yeah.

4425
02:23:17,272 --> 02:23:19,079
- But I don't even know
like what it would do.

4426
02:23:19,079 --> 02:23:21,590
Maybe it's can hide
stuff before you see it.

4427
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:22,423
Scroll down.
- I have that,

4428
02:23:22,423 --> 02:23:23,880
I have Chrome extensions.

4429
02:23:23,879 --> 02:23:25,649
I write a lot of Chrome extensions

4430
02:23:25,649 --> 02:23:27,930
that hide parts of
different pages and so on.

4431
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:29,802
- Yeah.
- For example,

4432
02:23:29,802 --> 02:23:32,549
on my main computer, I
hide all views and likes

4433
02:23:32,549 --> 02:23:36,899
and all that on YouTube
content that I create.

4434
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:38,459
So that I don't-
- Smart, doesn't affect you.

4435
02:23:38,459 --> 02:23:39,292
- It doesn't, yeah.

4436
02:23:39,292 --> 02:23:40,350
So you don't pay attention to it.

4437
02:23:40,350 --> 02:23:42,425
- Yeah.
- I also hide parts there.

4438
02:23:42,425 --> 02:23:46,350
I have a mode for X where
I hide most of everything.

4439
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:48,540
So there's no, it's same with YouTube.

4440
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:49,770
- I have the same, I have this extension.

4441
02:23:49,770 --> 02:23:51,460
- Well, I wrote my own 'cause it's easier.

4442
02:23:51,459 --> 02:23:52,910
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it keeps changing.

4443
02:23:52,911 --> 02:23:56,309
It's not easy to keep
it dynamically changing,

4444
02:23:56,309 --> 02:23:59,879
but they're really good at like
getting you to be distracted

4445
02:23:59,879 --> 02:24:01,757
and like starting to-
- Related accounts,

4446
02:24:01,757 --> 02:24:02,591
related post.
- Related stuff.

4447
02:24:02,591 --> 02:24:03,659
- I'm like, I don't want related.

4448
02:24:03,659 --> 02:24:06,059
- And like 10 minutes later you're like,

4449
02:24:06,059 --> 02:24:07,859
or something that's trending.

4450
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:09,750
I have a weird amount of
friends addicted to YouTube,

4451
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,620
and I'm not addicted.

4452
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:13,665
I think 'cause my attention
span is too short for YouTube.

4453
02:24:13,665 --> 02:24:14,850
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

4454
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:17,370
But I have this extension
to like YouTube Unhook,

4455
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:19,440
which it hides all the related stuff.

4456
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:22,052
I can just see the video and it's amazing.

4457
02:24:23,489 --> 02:24:24,717
But sometimes I need to like,

4458
02:24:24,718 --> 02:24:26,793
I need to search a video
how to do something.

4459
02:24:26,792 --> 02:24:29,039
And then I go to YouTube

4460
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,750
and then I had these YouTube shorts.

4461
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:31,979
These YouTube shorts are like,

4462
02:24:31,979 --> 02:24:33,629
they're algorithmically designed

4463
02:24:33,629 --> 02:24:35,456
to just make you tap them.

4464
02:24:35,457 --> 02:24:38,100
And I tap and I then I'm
like five minutes later,

4465
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,712
with this face,

4466
02:24:39,712 --> 02:24:40,546
and you're just stuck.

4467
02:24:40,546 --> 02:24:41,880
And it's like, what happened?

4468
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:43,709
I was gonna open,

4469
02:24:43,709 --> 02:24:45,779
I was gonna play like the coffee mix,

4470
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:47,923
the music mix for drinking coffee together

4471
02:24:47,923 --> 02:24:49,350
in the morning, like jazz,

4472
02:24:49,350 --> 02:24:51,000
I didn't wanna go to shorts.

4473
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,102
So it's very difficult.

4474
02:24:54,299 --> 02:24:55,590
- I love how we're actually highlighting

4475
02:24:55,590 --> 02:24:57,059
all kinds of interesting problems

4476
02:24:57,059 --> 02:24:59,250
that all could be solved at a startup.

4477
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:01,709
Okay, so what about the exit?

4478
02:25:01,709 --> 02:25:03,869
When and how to exit?

4479
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:04,770
- Man, you shouldn't ask me

4480
02:25:04,770 --> 02:25:06,540
'cause I never sold my company,

4481
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:07,560
and I've-
- So you've never...

4482
02:25:07,559 --> 02:25:08,879
All the successful stuff you've done,

4483
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:09,712
you've never sold it.

4484
02:25:09,712 --> 02:25:11,698
- Yeah, it's kind of sad, right?

4485
02:25:11,698 --> 02:25:15,686
So I've been in a lot of
acquisition like deals and stuff,

4486
02:25:15,686 --> 02:25:18,299
and I learned a lot about
finance people as well there,

4487
02:25:18,299 --> 02:25:21,000
like manipulation and due diligence

4488
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,829
and then changing the valuation.

4489
02:25:22,829 --> 02:25:24,602
People change the valuation after.

4490
02:25:26,162 --> 02:25:28,739
A lot of people string
you on to acquire you

4491
02:25:28,739 --> 02:25:30,600
and then it takes six months.

4492
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:31,433
It's a classic.

4493
02:25:31,433 --> 02:25:32,460
It takes six to 12 months.

4494
02:25:32,459 --> 02:25:33,419
They wanna see everything.

4495
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:36,930
They wanna see your Stripe
and your code and whatever.

4496
02:25:36,930 --> 02:25:41,220
And then in the end, they'll
change the price to lower,

4497
02:25:41,219 --> 02:25:43,019
'cause you're already so invested.

4498
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:45,210
So it's a negotiation tactic, right?

4499
02:25:45,209 --> 02:25:47,429
I'm like, no, then I
don't want to sell, right?

4500
02:25:47,430 --> 02:25:48,780
And the problem with my companies is like,

4501
02:25:48,780 --> 02:25:52,050
they make 90% profit margin.

4502
02:25:52,049 --> 02:25:54,059
So the multiple,

4503
02:25:54,059 --> 02:25:55,439
companies get sold with multiples,

4504
02:25:55,440 --> 02:25:57,360
kind of multiples of profit or revenue.

4505
02:25:57,360 --> 02:25:59,880
And often the multiple
is like three times,

4506
02:25:59,879 --> 02:26:00,839
three times or four times

4507
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:03,270
or five times revenue or profit.

4508
02:26:03,270 --> 02:26:06,000
So in my case, they're all automated.

4509
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,799
So I might as as well wait three years

4510
02:26:07,799 --> 02:26:10,170
and I get the same money as when I sell

4511
02:26:10,170 --> 02:26:12,180
and then I can still
sell the same company.

4512
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,013
You know what I mean?

4513
02:26:13,013 --> 02:26:13,977
I can still sell for three, five times.

4514
02:26:13,977 --> 02:26:17,796
So financially, it doesn't
really make sense to sell.

4515
02:26:17,796 --> 02:26:18,750
- Yeah.

4516
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:19,920
- Unless the price high enough.

4517
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,260
If the price gets to
six or seven or eight,

4518
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:24,450
I don't wanna wait six
years for the money.

4519
02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:25,320
But if you give me three,

4520
02:26:25,319 --> 02:26:26,601
like three years is nothing.

4521
02:26:26,602 --> 02:26:27,870
I can wait.

4522
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:31,079
- So that means they're
really valuable stuff

4523
02:26:31,079 --> 02:26:32,129
about the companies you created

4524
02:26:32,129 --> 02:26:33,879
is not just the interface

4525
02:26:34,798 --> 02:26:36,300
and the crowdsource content,

4526
02:26:36,299 --> 02:26:39,059
but the people themselves,
like the user base.

4527
02:26:39,059 --> 02:26:39,893
- Yeah.

4528
02:26:39,893 --> 02:26:41,549
So Nomad List, it's a community, yeah.

4529
02:26:41,549 --> 02:26:43,829
- So I could see that
being extremely valuable.

4530
02:26:43,829 --> 02:26:44,663
- Yeah.
- I'm surprised that has not.

4531
02:26:44,663 --> 02:26:45,496
- But Nomad List,

4532
02:26:45,495 --> 02:26:46,328
it's like my baby.

4533
02:26:46,328 --> 02:26:47,190
It's like my first project I took off,

4534
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:49,260
and I don't really know
if I wanna sell it.

4535
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:50,093
It's like something you-
- Yeah.

4536
02:26:50,093 --> 02:26:51,690
- Would be nice when you're old

4537
02:26:51,690 --> 02:26:53,481
to just still work on this.

4538
02:26:53,481 --> 02:26:55,530
It has like a mission,

4539
02:26:55,530 --> 02:26:58,230
which is like people
should travel anywhere

4540
02:26:58,229 --> 02:26:59,340
and they can work from anywhere

4541
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:01,110
and they can meet different cultures.

4542
02:27:01,110 --> 02:27:03,090
And that's a good way to
make the world get better.

4543
02:27:03,090 --> 02:27:05,399
If you go to China and live in China,

4544
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:07,109
you'll learn that they're nice people.

4545
02:27:07,110 --> 02:27:09,210
And a lot of stuff you hear
about China's propaganda,

4546
02:27:09,209 --> 02:27:10,259
a lot of stuff is true as well.

4547
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:12,989
But it's more, you know, you
learn a lot from traveling.

4548
02:27:12,989 --> 02:27:17,520
And I think that's why it's
a cool product to not sell.

4549
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:19,319
AI products, I have less emotional feeling

4550
02:27:19,319 --> 02:27:22,979
with AI products like photo
AI, which I could sell, yeah.

4551
02:27:22,979 --> 02:27:26,069
- Yeah, the thing you also
mentioned is you have to

4552
02:27:26,069 --> 02:27:28,712
price in the fact that
you're going to miss.

4553
02:27:29,610 --> 02:27:30,930
- Yeah.
- The company you created.

4554
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:32,700
- And the meaning it gives you, right?

4555
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:34,260
There's a very famous depression

4556
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:36,180
after start finding a solar company.

4557
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:38,040
They're like, this was me.

4558
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:39,120
Like who am I?

4559
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,655
And they immediately start
building another one.

4560
02:27:40,655 --> 02:27:42,480
(Lex laughs)
They never can stop.

4561
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:46,379
So I think it's good to
keep working until you die.

4562
02:27:46,379 --> 02:27:47,670
Just keep working on cool stuff

4563
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:50,040
and you shouldn't retire.

4564
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:52,260
I think retirement's bad probably.

4565
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:55,563
- So you usually build this
stuff solo and mostly work solo.

4566
02:27:56,639 --> 02:27:58,769
What's the thinking behind that?

4567
02:27:58,770 --> 02:28:00,479
- I think I'm not so good
working with other people.

4568
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:03,930
Not like I'm crazy, but I
don't trust other people.

4569
02:28:03,930 --> 02:28:04,763
- To clarify,

4570
02:28:04,763 --> 02:28:07,170
you don't trust other
people to do a great job.

4571
02:28:07,170 --> 02:28:10,920
- Yeah, and I don't wanna
have this consensus meeting

4572
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:12,450
where we all like,

4573
02:28:12,450 --> 02:28:13,800
you have a meeting of three people

4574
02:28:13,799 --> 02:28:16,877
and then you kind of get
this compromise results,

4575
02:28:16,878 --> 02:28:18,930
which is very European.

4576
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:20,489
In Holland, we call pull them whatever.

4577
02:28:20,489 --> 02:28:22,860
You put people the room
and you only let 'em out

4578
02:28:22,860 --> 02:28:24,600
when they agree on the compromise, right?

4579
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,620
In politics.

4580
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:28,829
I think it breeds like averageness,

4581
02:28:28,829 --> 02:28:31,729
you get an average idea, average
company, average culture,

4582
02:28:33,450 --> 02:28:36,870
you need to have a leader
or you need to be solo

4583
02:28:36,870 --> 02:28:39,807
and just do it, do it yourself, I think.

4584
02:28:39,807 --> 02:28:41,190
And I trust some people,

4585
02:28:41,190 --> 02:28:42,780
now with my best friend Andre,

4586
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:44,613
I'm making a new AI startup.

4587
02:28:44,612 --> 02:28:47,010
But it's because we know
each other very long

4588
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:50,639
and he's one of the few people
I would build something with

4589
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:51,989
but almost never, yeah.

4590
02:28:51,989 --> 02:28:53,190
- So what does it take to be successful

4591
02:28:53,190 --> 02:28:56,426
when you have more than one?

4592
02:28:56,425 --> 02:28:58,319
How do you build together with Andre?

4593
02:28:58,319 --> 02:28:59,329
How do you build together
with other people?

4594
02:28:59,329 --> 02:29:02,430
- So he codes, I should post on Twitter.

4595
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:04,800
Literally, I promoted on Twitter.

4596
02:29:04,799 --> 02:29:06,569
We set product strategy.

4597
02:29:06,569 --> 02:29:08,399
I said, this should be
better, this should be better.

4598
02:29:08,399 --> 02:29:10,770
But I think you need to
have one person coding it.

4599
02:29:10,770 --> 02:29:13,079
He codes in Ruby so was
like cannot do Ruby,

4600
02:29:13,079 --> 02:29:14,520
I'm in PHP.

4601
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:17,579
- So have you ever coded
with another person

4602
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:18,959
for prolonged periods of time?

4603
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:19,792
- Never in my life.

4604
02:29:19,792 --> 02:29:22,132
(Lex laughs)

4605
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:26,310
- What do you think is behind that?

4606
02:29:26,309 --> 02:29:28,799
- I know it was always just
me sitting on my laptop,

4607
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:30,059
like coding.

4608
02:29:30,059 --> 02:29:32,069
- No, like you've never
had another developer

4609
02:29:32,069 --> 02:29:33,600
who like rolls in and like?

4610
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:34,433
- I've had once with Photo AI,

4611
02:29:34,433 --> 02:29:36,420
there's an AI developer, Philip,

4612
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:37,590
I hired him to do the...

4613
02:29:37,590 --> 02:29:39,070
'Cause I can't write Python.

4614
02:29:39,070 --> 02:29:40,346
- Yeah.
- And AI stuff is Python.

4615
02:29:40,346 --> 02:29:43,379
And I needed to get models to
work and replicate and stuff.

4616
02:29:43,379 --> 02:29:45,569
And I needed to improve Photo AI.

4617
02:29:45,569 --> 02:29:48,059
And he helped me a lot
for 10 months he worked,

4618
02:29:48,059 --> 02:29:50,760
and man, I was trying
Python working with NumPy,

4619
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:52,409
and package manager and it
was too difficult for me

4620
02:29:52,409 --> 02:29:53,243
to figure this shit out.

4621
02:29:53,243 --> 02:29:54,393
And I didn't have time.

4622
02:29:55,350 --> 02:29:57,550
I think 10 years ago I
would've time to sit,

4623
02:29:58,649 --> 02:30:01,529
go do all-nighters to figure
this stuff out with Python.

4624
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:02,900
I don't have the...

4625
02:30:03,989 --> 02:30:04,823
It's not my thing,

4626
02:30:04,823 --> 02:30:05,656
- But it's not your thing.

4627
02:30:05,656 --> 02:30:07,110
It's another programming
language, I get it.

4628
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:09,180
AI, new thing, got it.

4629
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:11,250
But you never had a developer roll in,

4630
02:30:11,250 --> 02:30:14,837
look at your PHP, jQuery code and yes,

4631
02:30:14,837 --> 02:30:16,600
like in conversation or improv-

4632
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:17,760
- Yeah.
- They talk about yes,

4633
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:20,340
and, like basically, alright.

4634
02:30:20,340 --> 02:30:22,020
- I had for one week.
- Understand.

4635
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:23,640
- And that ended.

4636
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:24,472
- What happened?

4637
02:30:24,472 --> 02:30:25,950
- Because he wanted to
rewrite everything in the-

4638
02:30:25,950 --> 02:30:27,090
- No, that's the wrong guy.

4639
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:28,076
- I know.
- He wanted to rewrite

4640
02:30:28,076 --> 02:30:29,039
and what?

4641
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:29,873
- He wanted to rewrite,

4642
02:30:29,872 --> 02:30:31,949
he said this jQuery, we cannot do this.

4643
02:30:31,950 --> 02:30:32,820
I'm like, okay.

4644
02:30:32,819 --> 02:30:35,129
He's we need to rewrite
a thing in Vue, vue.js

4645
02:30:35,129 --> 02:30:36,239
I'm like, "Are you sure?

4646
02:30:36,239 --> 02:30:38,489
Can we just like, you know, keep jQuery?"

4647
02:30:38,489 --> 02:30:39,709
He's like, "No, man."

4648
02:30:39,709 --> 02:30:41,879
And we need to change a lot of stuff.

4649
02:30:41,879 --> 02:30:42,836
And I'm like, "Okay."

4650
02:30:42,836 --> 02:30:44,939
And I was kinda feeling it like this,

4651
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:46,770
you know, we're gonna clean up shit.

4652
02:30:46,770 --> 02:30:47,603
But then after week,

4653
02:30:47,602 --> 02:30:49,506
this is gonna take way too much time.

4654
02:30:49,506 --> 02:30:51,299
- I think I like working with people

4655
02:30:51,299 --> 02:30:54,302
where when I approach them,

4656
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:56,940
I pretend in my head

4657
02:30:56,940 --> 02:30:59,175
that they're the smartest
person who has ever existed.

4658
02:30:59,174 --> 02:31:01,500
- Wow.
- So I look at their code

4659
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:03,180
or I look at the stuff they've created

4660
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:05,430
and try to see the genius of their way.

4661
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:07,710
You really have to understand people,

4662
02:31:07,709 --> 02:31:10,022
like really notice them.

4663
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,770
And then from that place
have a conversation

4664
02:31:13,770 --> 02:31:15,180
about what is the better approach.

4665
02:31:15,180 --> 02:31:17,399
- Yeah, but those are
the top tier developers.

4666
02:31:17,399 --> 02:31:18,233
- [Lex] Yeah.

4667
02:31:18,233 --> 02:31:20,790
- Those are the ones
that are tech ambiguous.

4668
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:22,170
So they can work with,

4669
02:31:22,170 --> 02:31:23,416
they can learn any tech stack

4670
02:31:23,416 --> 02:31:24,250
and they can-
- Yeah.

4671
02:31:24,250 --> 02:31:25,440
- And that's like really few,

4672
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:26,340
it's like-
- Really?

4673
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:27,450
- Top 5%.
- Damn.

4674
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:28,645
- Because if you try higher devs,

4675
02:31:28,645 --> 02:31:30,870
no offense to devs, but most devs are not.

4676
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:33,840
Man, most people in general
jobs are not so good at the job,

4677
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:35,430
even doctors and stuff.
- That's too sad.

4678
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,690
- When you realize this,

4679
02:31:36,690 --> 02:31:37,998
people are very average at the job.

4680
02:31:37,998 --> 02:31:38,832
- Yeah.

4681
02:31:38,832 --> 02:31:41,130
- Especially with dev
with coding, I think.

4682
02:31:41,129 --> 02:31:41,962
So sorry for-

4683
02:31:41,962 --> 02:31:42,957
- I think that's a really important skill

4684
02:31:42,957 --> 02:31:44,880
for a developer to roll in

4685
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:48,449
and understand the musicality, the style.

4686
02:31:48,450 --> 02:31:49,283
- That's it, man.

4687
02:31:49,282 --> 02:31:50,951
Empathy, it's like code empathy, right?

4688
02:31:50,951 --> 02:31:51,784
- It's code empathy.

4689
02:31:51,784 --> 02:31:53,217
- Yeah, it's new word, but that's it.

4690
02:31:53,217 --> 02:31:54,367
You need to understand,

4691
02:31:55,379 --> 02:31:57,119
go over the code, get
a holistic view of it

4692
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:00,903
and man, you can suggest
we change stuff, for sure.

4693
02:32:02,129 --> 02:32:03,479
And look, jQuery is crazy.

4694
02:32:03,479 --> 02:32:04,859
It's crazy, I'm using jQuery.

4695
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:05,693
We can change that.

4696
02:32:05,692 --> 02:32:06,869
- It's not crazy at all.

4697
02:32:06,870 --> 02:32:08,460
jQuery is also beautiful-
- Yeah.

4698
02:32:08,459 --> 02:32:09,292
- And powerful,

4699
02:32:09,292 --> 02:32:10,799
and PHP is beautiful and powerful.

4700
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:12,399
Especially as you said recently,

4701
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:17,190
as the versions evolved,

4702
02:32:17,190 --> 02:32:19,200
it's much more serious
programming language now.

4703
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,370
It's super fast.
- For sure.

4704
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:22,680
- Like PHP is really fast now.

4705
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:24,377
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's crazy JavaScripts-

4706
02:32:24,377 --> 02:32:25,470
- Much faster than Ruby, yeah.

4707
02:32:25,469 --> 02:32:26,989
- Really fast now.
- Yeah.

4708
02:32:26,989 --> 02:32:28,649
- So if speed is something you care about,

4709
02:32:28,649 --> 02:32:29,639
it's super fast.
- Yeah.

4710
02:32:29,639 --> 02:32:32,188
- And there's gigantic
communities of people-

4711
02:32:32,188 --> 02:32:33,021
- [Pieter] Yeah.

4712
02:32:33,021 --> 02:32:33,854
- Using those program languages,

4713
02:32:33,853 --> 02:32:35,489
and there's frameworks if
you like the framework.

4714
02:32:35,489 --> 02:32:37,770
So whatever, it doesn't
really matter what you use,

4715
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:42,542
but also you, if I was like
a developer working with you,

4716
02:32:42,542 --> 02:32:44,609
like you are extremely successful.

4717
02:32:44,610 --> 02:32:46,590
You've shipped a lot.
- Yeah.

4718
02:32:46,590 --> 02:32:50,610
- So like if I roll in, I'm gonna be like,

4719
02:32:50,610 --> 02:32:52,680
I don't assume you know nothing.

4720
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:54,180
Assume Pieter is a genius,

4721
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:55,860
like the smartest developer ever.

4722
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:56,950
And like learn, learn from it.

4723
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:58,533
- Yeah.
- And yes and.

4724
02:32:59,909 --> 02:33:02,129
Notice parts in the code
where like, okay, okay, okay.

4725
02:33:02,129 --> 02:33:03,420
I got it.
- Yeah.

4726
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:05,579
- Here's how he's thinking.

4727
02:33:05,579 --> 02:33:08,969
And now if I want to add another,

4728
02:33:08,969 --> 02:33:10,439
like a little feature,

4729
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:12,370
definitely needs to have emoji. (laughs)

4730
02:33:12,370 --> 02:33:13,829
- Yeah, man.
- In front of it.

4731
02:33:13,829 --> 02:33:16,949
And then like just follow
the same style and add it.

4732
02:33:16,949 --> 02:33:17,782
- [Pieter] Yeah.

4733
02:33:17,781 --> 02:33:19,559
- And my goal is to make you happy,

4734
02:33:19,559 --> 02:33:20,729
to make you smile,

4735
02:33:20,729 --> 02:33:23,250
to make you, ha-ha, fuck, I get it.

4736
02:33:23,250 --> 02:33:25,719
And now you're going
to start respecting me.

4737
02:33:25,719 --> 02:33:27,329
- Yeah.
- And like trusting me,

4738
02:33:27,329 --> 02:33:29,520
and you start working
together in this way.

4739
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:31,110
I don't know.

4740
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:32,880
I don't know how hard
it's to find developers.

4741
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:33,712
- No, I think they exist.

4742
02:33:33,712 --> 02:33:35,112
I think I need to hire more people.

4743
02:33:35,112 --> 02:33:36,569
I need to try more people.
- Try people, yeah.

4744
02:33:36,569 --> 02:33:38,340
- But that costs a lot
of my energy and time.

4745
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:40,170
- Yeah.
- But it's 100% possible.

4746
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:41,112
- Yeah.
- But do I want it?

4747
02:33:41,112 --> 02:33:43,539
I don't know, things
kind of run fine for now.

4748
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:44,373
(Lex laughs)

4749
02:33:44,372 --> 02:33:45,206
And I mean like, okay.

4750
02:33:45,206 --> 02:33:46,039
You could say like, okay,

4751
02:33:46,039 --> 02:33:47,640
Nomad List looks kind of clunky.

4752
02:33:47,639 --> 02:33:48,659
People say the design's gonna clunky.

4753
02:33:48,659 --> 02:33:49,649
Okay, I'll improve the design.

4754
02:33:49,649 --> 02:33:52,302
It's like next to my
to-do list, for example.

4755
02:33:52,302 --> 02:33:54,030
I'll get there eventually.

4756
02:33:54,030 --> 02:33:54,863
- But it's true.

4757
02:33:54,862 --> 02:33:57,389
I mean you're also extremely
good at what you do.

4758
02:33:57,389 --> 02:34:00,659
I'm just looking at the
interfaces of Photo AI.

4759
02:34:00,659 --> 02:34:03,180
You with jQuery, right?

4760
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:05,340
How amazing is jQuery?

4761
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:08,790
These cowboys are getting, these are...

4762
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:10,950
There's these cowboys.

4763
02:34:10,950 --> 02:34:13,200
This is a lot, this is a lot.

4764
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,270
But I'm glad they're all wearing shirts.

4765
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:18,063
Anyway, the interface here
is just really, really nice.

4766
02:34:18,989 --> 02:34:21,209
I could tell you know what you're doing

4767
02:34:21,209 --> 02:34:25,231
and with Nomad List extremely
nice, the interface.

4768
02:34:25,231 --> 02:34:26,065
- Thank you, man.

4769
02:34:26,065 --> 02:34:27,239
- And that's all you.

4770
02:34:27,239 --> 02:34:29,399
- [Pieter] Yeah, that's everything is me.

4771
02:34:29,399 --> 02:34:31,260
- So all of this and every little feature.

4772
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:32,093
All of this.
- People say

4773
02:34:32,093 --> 02:34:33,307
it looks kind of ADHD or ADD,

4774
02:34:33,307 --> 02:34:38,100
like it's so much because
it has so many things

4775
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:40,229
and designs these days is minimalist.

4776
02:34:40,229 --> 02:34:41,789
Right?
- Right, right, I hear you.

4777
02:34:41,790 --> 02:34:43,950
But this is a lot of information

4778
02:34:43,950 --> 02:34:45,480
and it's useful information,

4779
02:34:45,479 --> 02:34:47,879
and it's delivered in a clean way

4780
02:34:47,879 --> 02:34:50,009
while still stylish and fun to look at.

4781
02:34:50,010 --> 02:34:52,110
So like minimalist design is about

4782
02:34:52,110 --> 02:34:54,730
when you want to convey
no information whatsoever-

4783
02:34:54,730 --> 02:34:55,889
- Yeah.
- And look cool.

4784
02:34:55,889 --> 02:34:57,059
- Yeah, it's very cool.

4785
02:34:57,059 --> 02:34:57,959
It's pretentious, right?

4786
02:34:57,959 --> 02:35:00,959
- Pretentious or not,
the function is useless.

4787
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:02,699
This is about a lot of information

4788
02:35:02,700 --> 02:35:05,040
delivered to you in a clean,

4789
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,290
and when it's clean you can't be too sexy.

4790
02:35:07,290 --> 02:35:08,220
So it's sexy enough.

4791
02:35:08,219 --> 02:35:10,199
- Yeah, this is I think
how my brain looks.

4792
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:11,972
It's a lot of shit going on.

4793
02:35:11,972 --> 02:35:13,409
It's like drawing bass music.

4794
02:35:13,409 --> 02:35:15,899
It's like very (imitates bass music)

4795
02:35:15,899 --> 02:35:17,159
- Yeah, but it's this still...

4796
02:35:17,159 --> 02:35:19,200
The spacing of everything is nice.

4797
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:21,480
The fonts are really nice.

4798
02:35:21,479 --> 02:35:23,453
Like very readable, very small.

4799
02:35:23,453 --> 02:35:24,287
- Yeah, I like it, you know,

4800
02:35:24,287 --> 02:35:26,909
but I made it so I don't
trust my own judgment.

4801
02:35:26,909 --> 02:35:28,739
- No, this is really nice.
- Thank you, man.

4802
02:35:28,739 --> 02:35:30,959
- Emojis are somehow,

4803
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:32,879
like this is a style, it's a thing.

4804
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:33,809
- I need to pick the emoji.

4805
02:35:33,809 --> 02:35:36,329
It takes a while to pick them.

4806
02:35:36,329 --> 02:35:39,420
- Something about the emoji
is a really nice memorable,

4807
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:41,958
like placeholder for the idea.

4808
02:35:41,958 --> 02:35:43,380
- Yeah.
- If it was just text,

4809
02:35:43,379 --> 02:35:45,750
it would actually be overwhelming
if you was just text.

4810
02:35:45,750 --> 02:35:47,399
The emoji really helps.

4811
02:35:47,399 --> 02:35:49,529
That's a brilliant addition.

4812
02:35:49,530 --> 02:35:50,394
Some people might look at it,

4813
02:35:50,394 --> 02:35:51,600
why do you have emojis everywhere?

4814
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:53,069
It's actually really, for me, it's really-

4815
02:35:53,069 --> 02:35:54,510
- People tell me to remove the emojis.

4816
02:35:54,510 --> 02:35:55,720
- Yeah, well, people don't know
what they're talking about.

4817
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:57,387
- Makes it immature.

4818
02:35:58,649 --> 02:36:00,359
- I'm sure people will
tell you a lot of things.

4819
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:01,500
This is really nice.

4820
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:04,440
And then using color is nice.

4821
02:36:04,440 --> 02:36:06,630
Small font but not too small.

4822
02:36:06,629 --> 02:36:07,979
And obviously, you have to show maps,

4823
02:36:07,979 --> 02:36:09,050
which is really tricky.

4824
02:36:09,050 --> 02:36:09,884
- Yeah.

4825
02:36:10,968 --> 02:36:12,719
- Yeah.
- This is nice.

4826
02:36:12,719 --> 02:36:15,188
- No, this is really, really, really nice.

4827
02:36:15,189 --> 02:36:17,051
I mean, okay, how this looks

4828
02:36:17,051 --> 02:36:20,039
when you hover over it?

4829
02:36:20,040 --> 02:36:21,870
- Yeah, it's easy as transitions.

4830
02:36:21,870 --> 02:36:23,730
- No, I understand that.

4831
02:36:23,729 --> 02:36:24,809
I'm sure there's like,

4832
02:36:24,809 --> 02:36:25,643
how long does that take you to figure

4833
02:36:25,643 --> 02:36:27,180
out how you want it to look?

4834
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:28,319
Do you ever go down a rabbit hole

4835
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:29,760
where you spent like two weeks?

4836
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:30,630
- No, it's all iterative.

4837
02:36:30,629 --> 02:36:32,639
It's like 10 years of, you know,

4838
02:36:32,639 --> 02:36:35,219
added C transition here or do this or.

4839
02:36:35,219 --> 02:36:36,510
- Well, let's say like,

4840
02:36:36,510 --> 02:36:38,850
see these are rounded now.
- Yeah.

4841
02:36:38,850 --> 02:36:41,190
- If you wanted to like round
is probably the better way.

4842
02:36:41,190 --> 02:36:42,810
But if you want it to be rectangular,

4843
02:36:42,809 --> 02:36:44,699
like sharp corners, what would you do?

4844
02:36:44,700 --> 02:36:47,280
You just?
- So go to the index at CSS.

4845
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:49,050
- Yeah.
- And I do Command + F.

4846
02:36:49,049 --> 02:36:51,248
and I search border radius 12 px.

4847
02:36:51,248 --> 02:36:52,082
- [Lex] Yeah.

4848
02:36:52,082 --> 02:36:54,765
- And then I replace
with border radius zero.

4849
02:36:54,765 --> 02:36:55,750
And then I do Command + Enter-

4850
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:58,200
- Yeah.
- And it's get deploys,

4851
02:36:58,200 --> 02:36:59,277
it pushes to the git hub

4852
02:36:59,277 --> 02:37:01,649
and then sends a WebBook and
then deploys to my server,

4853
02:37:01,649 --> 02:37:04,709
and it's live in five seconds.

4854
02:37:04,709 --> 02:37:06,479
- Oh, you often deployed to production.

4855
02:37:06,479 --> 02:37:08,077
You don't have like a testing ground?

4856
02:37:08,077 --> 02:37:10,942
- No.
(Lex laughs)

4857
02:37:11,865 --> 02:37:13,319
So I'm like famous for this,

4858
02:37:13,319 --> 02:37:15,779
'cause I'm too lazy to set up

4859
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:17,460
a staging server on my laptop every time.

4860
02:37:17,459 --> 02:37:19,829
So nowadays I just deploy to production.

4861
02:37:19,829 --> 02:37:21,360
- [Lex] Yeah.

4862
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:22,890
- Man, I'm gonna be canceled for this.

4863
02:37:22,889 --> 02:37:24,509
But it works very well for me,

4864
02:37:24,509 --> 02:37:25,358
'cause I have a lot of...

4865
02:37:25,358 --> 02:37:26,909
I have PHP Lint and djLint

4866
02:37:26,909 --> 02:37:27,930
so it tells me when there's error.

4867
02:37:27,930 --> 02:37:29,220
So I don't deploy.
- Yeah.

4868
02:37:29,219 --> 02:37:30,569
- But literally,

4869
02:37:30,569 --> 02:37:33,930
I have like 37,000 git commits

4870
02:37:33,930 --> 02:37:34,920
in the last 12 months or something.

4871
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:36,420
So I make small fix

4872
02:37:36,420 --> 02:37:38,092
and then Command + Enter,

4873
02:37:38,092 --> 02:37:39,480
and sends to GitHub.

4874
02:37:39,479 --> 02:37:41,010
GitHub sends a web to server,

4875
02:37:41,010 --> 02:37:44,069
web server pulls it,
deploys the production,

4876
02:37:44,069 --> 02:37:44,940
and is there.

4877
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:46,140
- What's the latency of that

4878
02:37:46,139 --> 02:37:47,369
from you pressing Command + Enter?

4879
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:49,500
- One second, can be one two seconds.

4880
02:37:49,500 --> 02:37:51,030
- So you just make a change and then you-

4881
02:37:51,030 --> 02:37:52,409
- That's right.
- Getting really good at like

4882
02:37:52,409 --> 02:37:53,343
not making mistakes basically.

4883
02:37:53,343 --> 02:37:54,510
- Man, 100%, you're right.

4884
02:37:54,510 --> 02:37:55,440
People are like, how can you do this?

4885
02:37:55,440 --> 02:37:56,273
Well, you get good at not

4886
02:37:56,272 --> 02:37:57,719
taking the server down.
- Yeah.

4887
02:37:57,719 --> 02:37:59,769
- 'Cause you need to code more carefully.

4888
02:38:01,319 --> 02:38:02,850
Look, it's idiotic in any big company.

4889
02:38:02,850 --> 02:38:05,370
But for me, it works
'cause it makes me so fast.

4890
02:38:05,370 --> 02:38:08,350
Somebody will report a bug on Twitter

4891
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:11,430
and I kind of did do a stopwatch.

4892
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:12,630
How fast can I fix this bug?

4893
02:38:12,629 --> 02:38:15,119
And then two minutes later,
for example, it's fixed.

4894
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:16,110
- [Lex] Yeah.

4895
02:38:16,110 --> 02:38:18,150
- And it's fun 'cause it's annoying

4896
02:38:18,149 --> 02:38:20,159
for me to work with companies
where you report a bug

4897
02:38:20,159 --> 02:38:22,289
and it takes like six months.
- Yeah.

4898
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:23,123
- It's like horrible.

4899
02:38:23,122 --> 02:38:24,090
And it makes people really happy

4900
02:38:24,090 --> 02:38:27,659
when you can really quickly
solve their problems.

4901
02:38:27,659 --> 02:38:30,041
But it's crazy, I admit.

4902
02:38:30,041 --> 02:38:31,367
- I don't think it's crazy.

4903
02:38:31,367 --> 02:38:33,030
I mean, I'm sure there's a middle ground,

4904
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:35,280
but I think that whole thing

4905
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,650
where there's a phase of like testing

4906
02:38:37,649 --> 02:38:39,059
and there's the staging,

4907
02:38:39,059 --> 02:38:39,893
and there's a development

4908
02:38:39,893 --> 02:38:42,510
and then there's like multiple tables

4909
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:44,460
and databases that you use for the stage.

4910
02:38:44,459 --> 02:38:45,869
Like it's-
- Filing.

4911
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:46,703
- It's a mess.
- Yeah.

4912
02:38:46,702 --> 02:38:48,306
- And there's different teams involved.

4913
02:38:48,307 --> 02:38:49,530
It's not good.

4914
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:51,454
- I'm like a good funny
extreme on the other side.

4915
02:38:51,453 --> 02:38:54,389
- But just a little bit
safer but not too much.

4916
02:38:54,389 --> 02:38:56,277
It would be great.
- Yeah, yeah.

4917
02:38:56,277 --> 02:38:58,500
- And I'm sure that's
actually like how X now,

4918
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:00,719
how they're doing rapid improvement.

4919
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:01,552
It's exactly.
- No, they do

4920
02:39:01,552 --> 02:39:02,670
because there's more bugs.
- Yeah.

4921
02:39:02,670 --> 02:39:03,503
- And people complain about like,

4922
02:39:03,503 --> 02:39:04,770
oh look, he bought this Twitter.

4923
02:39:04,770 --> 02:39:05,603
Now it's full of bugs.

4924
02:39:05,602 --> 02:39:06,969
Dude, these shipping stuff-

4925
02:39:06,969 --> 02:39:08,145
- Yeah.
- Things are happening now

4926
02:39:08,146 --> 02:39:10,524
and it's a dynamic app now.

4927
02:39:10,523 --> 02:39:11,760
- Yeah, the bugs is actually

4928
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:12,899
a sign of a good thing happening.

4929
02:39:12,899 --> 02:39:13,979
- Yes.
- The bugs of the feature

4930
02:39:13,979 --> 02:39:14,813
because it shows-
- Yes.

4931
02:39:14,813 --> 02:39:16,260
- That the team is actually building shit.

4932
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:17,370
- 100%, yeah.

4933
02:39:17,370 --> 02:39:18,600
- Well, one of the problems is like

4934
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:20,909
I see with YouTube
there's so much potential

4935
02:39:20,909 --> 02:39:25,909
to build features, but I
just see how long it takes.

4936
02:39:26,129 --> 02:39:30,209
So I've gotten a chance to
interact with many other teams.

4937
02:39:30,209 --> 02:39:34,295
But one of the teams is
MLA, multi-language audio.

4938
02:39:34,296 --> 02:39:35,760
- Yeah.
- I dunno if you know this,

4939
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:37,440
but in YouTube you can have

4940
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:39,239
audio tracks in different languages.

4941
02:39:39,239 --> 02:39:40,590
- Yeah.
- For over dubbing.

4942
02:39:40,590 --> 02:39:41,670
And there's a team,

4943
02:39:41,670 --> 02:39:43,530
and not many people are using it,

4944
02:39:43,530 --> 02:39:45,960
but like every single feature,

4945
02:39:45,959 --> 02:39:47,189
they have to meet and agree,

4946
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:49,800
and there's allocate resources.

4947
02:39:49,799 --> 02:39:51,179
Engineers have to work on it.

4948
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:52,350
But I'm sure it's a pain in the ass

4949
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:54,186
for the engineers to get approval to like,

4950
02:39:54,186 --> 02:39:55,020
- [Pieter] I know.

4951
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:57,300
- Because it has to not
break the rest of the site,

4952
02:39:57,299 --> 02:39:58,584
whatever they do.

4953
02:39:58,584 --> 02:40:01,619
But if you don't have enough dictatorial,

4954
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:04,860
like top down, like we need this now,

4955
02:40:04,860 --> 02:40:05,700
it's gonna take forever

4956
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:07,530
to do anything multi-language audio.

4957
02:40:07,530 --> 02:40:10,440
But multi-language audio is
a good example of a thing

4958
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:12,315
that seems niche right now,

4959
02:40:12,315 --> 02:40:16,143
but it quite possibly could
change the entire world.

4960
02:40:16,988 --> 02:40:19,469
When I upload this
conversation right here,

4961
02:40:19,469 --> 02:40:24,469
if instantaneously, it
dubs it into 40 languages.

4962
02:40:24,838 --> 02:40:25,672
- [Pieter] Yeah, man.

4963
02:40:25,672 --> 02:40:28,380
- And everybody consume every single video

4964
02:40:28,379 --> 02:40:30,689
can be watched and listened to

4965
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:32,670
in those different, it changes everything.

4966
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:34,979
And YouTube is extremely well-positioned

4967
02:40:34,979 --> 02:40:36,335
to be the leader in this.
- Yeah.

4968
02:40:36,335 --> 02:40:38,069
- They got the compute,

4969
02:40:38,069 --> 02:40:40,772
they got the user base,

4970
02:40:41,639 --> 02:40:43,709
they have the experience
of how to do this.

4971
02:40:43,709 --> 02:40:46,079
So like multi-language audio should be-

4972
02:40:46,079 --> 02:40:47,430
- High priority feature, right?

4973
02:40:47,430 --> 02:40:49,500
- Yeah, that's high priority.
- Yeah, yeah.

4974
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:50,790
- And it's a way,

4975
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:52,170
Google is obsessed with AI right now.

4976
02:40:52,170 --> 02:40:54,870
They wanna show off that
they could be dominant in AI.

4977
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:57,210
That's a way for Google
to say like, we used AI.

4978
02:40:57,209 --> 02:41:00,599
This is a way to break down the walls

4979
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:01,680
that language creates.

4980
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:02,513
- The preferred outcome

4981
02:41:02,513 --> 02:41:03,960
for them is probably their career

4982
02:41:03,959 --> 02:41:07,559
and not the overall result
of the cool product.

4983
02:41:07,559 --> 02:41:09,719
- I think they're not
like selfish or whatever,

4984
02:41:09,719 --> 02:41:10,829
they wanna do good.

4985
02:41:10,829 --> 02:41:12,209
There's something about the machine-

4986
02:41:12,209 --> 02:41:13,042
- The organization, yeah.

4987
02:41:13,042 --> 02:41:13,932
- The organizational stuff
that's just so I happens.

4988
02:41:13,933 --> 02:41:15,450
- I have this when I report bugs

4989
02:41:15,450 --> 02:41:18,240
on like big companies I work with.

4990
02:41:18,239 --> 02:41:19,650
I talk to a lot of different people in DM

4991
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:22,319
and they're all really
trying hard to do something.

4992
02:41:22,319 --> 02:41:23,819
They're all really nice.

4993
02:41:23,819 --> 02:41:25,619
And I'm the one being kind of asshole-

4994
02:41:25,620 --> 02:41:26,453
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm like,

4995
02:41:26,452 --> 02:41:28,170
guys, I'm talking to 20 people about this

4996
02:41:28,170 --> 02:41:29,382
for six months and nothing's happening.

4997
02:41:29,382 --> 02:41:32,663
I say, "Man, I know but
I'm trying my best."

4998
02:41:32,663 --> 02:41:34,140
Yeah, so it's systemic.

4999
02:41:34,139 --> 02:41:36,840
- Yeah, it requires, again,

5000
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:38,280
I don't know if there
must be a nicer word,

5001
02:41:38,280 --> 02:41:41,350
but like dictatorial type
of top down the CEO rolls in

5002
02:41:42,389 --> 02:41:45,369
and just says like, for
you two, it's like MLA.

5003
02:41:45,370 --> 02:41:46,860
- Yeah.
- Get this done now.

5004
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:48,420
This is the highest priority.

5005
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:50,520
- I think big companies,
especially in America,

5006
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:51,540
a lot of it's legal, right?

5007
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:53,250
They need to pass
everything through legal.

5008
02:41:53,250 --> 02:41:54,420
- Yeah.
- And you can't like,

5009
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:55,654
man, the things I do,

5010
02:41:55,654 --> 02:41:57,149
I could never do that
in a big corporation,

5011
02:41:57,149 --> 02:41:59,069
'cause it's everything has to be probably

5012
02:41:59,069 --> 02:42:01,079
Git deploy has to go through legal.

5013
02:42:01,079 --> 02:42:03,270
- Well, again, dictatorial,

5014
02:42:03,270 --> 02:42:06,569
you basically say Steve
Jobs did this quite a lot.

5015
02:42:06,569 --> 02:42:08,729
I've seen a lot of leaders do this.

5016
02:42:08,729 --> 02:42:09,779
Ignore the lawyers.

5017
02:42:09,780 --> 02:42:10,980
Ignore comms.
- Exactly, yeah.

5018
02:42:10,979 --> 02:42:13,260
- Ignore PR, ignore everybody.

5019
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:14,790
Give power to the engineers.

5020
02:42:14,790 --> 02:42:17,280
Listen to the people on the
ground, get this shit done,

5021
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:18,600
and get it done by Friday.

5022
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:19,827
- Yeah.
- That's it.

5023
02:42:19,826 --> 02:42:20,969
- And the law can change.

5024
02:42:20,969 --> 02:42:23,069
For example, let's say
you launch this AI dubbing

5025
02:42:23,069 --> 02:42:25,649
and there's some legal
problems with lawsuits.

5026
02:42:25,649 --> 02:42:27,750
Okay, so the law changes,
there will be appeals,

5027
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:29,850
there will be some Supreme
Court thing, whatever.

5028
02:42:29,850 --> 02:42:30,683
And the law changes.

5029
02:42:30,683 --> 02:42:32,970
So just by shipping it you change society,

5030
02:42:32,969 --> 02:42:34,739
you change the legal framework.

5031
02:42:34,739 --> 02:42:35,573
And by not shipping,

5032
02:42:35,573 --> 02:42:37,290
being scared of the legal
framework all the time.

5033
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:38,970
You're not changing things.

5034
02:42:38,969 --> 02:42:42,719
- Just outta curiosity,
what ID do you use?

5035
02:42:42,719 --> 02:42:44,925
Let's talk about like your whole setup.

5036
02:42:44,925 --> 02:42:47,579
Given how ultra productive you are

5037
02:42:47,579 --> 02:42:50,250
and that you often
program in your underwear

5038
02:42:50,250 --> 02:42:51,452
slouching on the couch.

5039
02:42:52,530 --> 02:42:55,320
Does it matter to you in general?

5040
02:42:55,319 --> 02:42:57,719
Is there like a specific
ID you use you use VS Code?

5041
02:42:57,719 --> 02:42:58,619
- Yeah, VS Code.

5042
02:42:58,620 --> 02:43:00,390
Before I used Sublime Text,

5043
02:43:00,389 --> 02:43:01,859
I don't think it matters a lot.

5044
02:43:01,860 --> 02:43:03,180
I think I'm very skeptical

5045
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:05,760
of like tools when people think it...

5046
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:06,809
They say it matters, right?

5047
02:43:06,809 --> 02:43:07,649
I don't think it matters.

5048
02:43:07,649 --> 02:43:10,829
I think whatever tool you know very well,

5049
02:43:10,829 --> 02:43:13,153
you go very, very fast and the shortcuts,

5050
02:43:13,153 --> 02:43:14,569
for example, IDE.

5051
02:43:15,583 --> 02:43:18,300
I love Sublime Text 'cause
I could use multi-cursor,

5052
02:43:18,299 --> 02:43:22,139
you search something and I
could just like make mass

5053
02:43:22,139 --> 02:43:23,879
replaces in a foul-
- Yeah.

5054
02:43:23,879 --> 02:43:24,779
- With the cursor thing,

5055
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:26,820
and VS Code doesn't
really have that as well.

5056
02:43:26,819 --> 02:43:27,653
- It's actually interesting.

5057
02:43:27,653 --> 02:43:30,496
Sublime is the first editor
where I've learned that.

5058
02:43:30,496 --> 02:43:31,329
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5059
02:43:31,329 --> 02:43:33,360
- And I think they just
make that super easy.

5060
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:34,500
So what would that be called?

5061
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:36,989
Multi-edit, multi-cursors edit-

5062
02:43:36,989 --> 02:43:38,468
- Yeah.
- Thing whatever.

5063
02:43:38,468 --> 02:43:39,301
- [Pieter] That's so good.

5064
02:43:39,301 --> 02:43:41,659
- I'm sure like almost
every editor can do that.

5065
02:43:41,659 --> 02:43:43,860
It is just probably hard to set up.

5066
02:43:43,860 --> 02:43:45,060
- Yeah.
- And why so why need it?

5067
02:43:45,059 --> 02:43:47,039
- VS Code is not so good, I think,

5068
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:48,330
Or at least I try it.

5069
02:43:48,329 --> 02:43:51,270
But I would use that to like process data.

5070
02:43:51,270 --> 02:43:52,560
Data sets, for example, from World Bank.

5071
02:43:52,559 --> 02:43:55,532
I would just multi-cursor
mass change everything,

5072
02:43:56,879 --> 02:43:58,649
but yeah, VS Codes.

5073
02:43:58,649 --> 02:44:00,180
Man, I was bullied into using VS Code,

5074
02:44:00,180 --> 02:44:02,130
'cause Twitter would
always see my screenshots

5075
02:44:02,129 --> 02:44:02,962
of Sublime Text and say,

5076
02:44:02,962 --> 02:44:05,010
"Why are you still using Sublime Text?"

5077
02:44:05,010 --> 02:44:06,575
Boomer, you need to use VS codes.

5078
02:44:06,575 --> 02:44:07,486
- Yeah.

5079
02:44:07,486 --> 02:44:08,370
- And I'm like, yeah, I'll try it.

5080
02:44:08,370 --> 02:44:09,420
I got a new MacBook

5081
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:11,639
and then I never installed,

5082
02:44:11,639 --> 02:44:12,809
I never copied the old MacBook.

5083
02:44:12,809 --> 02:44:14,039
I just make it fresh, you know,

5084
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:17,070
like a clean, like format C Windows.

5085
02:44:17,069 --> 02:44:19,226
Clean starts and I'm like,
'Okay, I'll try VS Code."

5086
02:44:19,227 --> 02:44:21,510
And it stuck, you know,
but I don't really care.

5087
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:23,040
It's not so important for me.

5088
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:25,260
- Wow, you know the
format C reference, huh?

5089
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,093
- Dude, it was so good.

5090
02:44:26,093 --> 02:44:27,360
You would install Windows

5091
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:29,790
and then after three or six
months it would start breaking

5092
02:44:29,790 --> 02:44:32,580
and everything was like get slow.

5093
02:44:32,579 --> 02:44:34,770
Then you would restart, go to Dos,

5094
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:37,530
format C, you would delete your hard drive

5095
02:44:37,530 --> 02:44:40,230
and then install the Windows 95 again,

5096
02:44:40,229 --> 02:44:41,969
that was so good times.

5097
02:44:41,969 --> 02:44:43,439
And you would design everything.

5098
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:44,790
Now I'm gonna install it properly.

5099
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:47,040
now I'm gonna design my desktop properly.

5100
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,270
- Yeah, I don't know
if it's peer pressure,

5101
02:44:48,270 --> 02:44:51,090
but like I used E-MAX for many, many years

5102
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:52,829
and I know, you know, I love Lisp.

5103
02:44:52,829 --> 02:44:56,039
So a lot of the customization
is done in Lisp.

5104
02:44:56,040 --> 02:44:57,360
It's a programming language.

5105
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,470
And partially, it was peer pressure.

5106
02:44:58,469 --> 02:45:00,299
But part of it's realizing like

5107
02:45:00,299 --> 02:45:01,899
you need to keep learning stuff.

5108
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:04,290
The same issue with jQuery.

5109
02:45:04,290 --> 02:45:08,130
I still think I need to
learn Node.js, for example.

5110
02:45:08,129 --> 02:45:08,962
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5111
02:45:08,962 --> 02:45:10,319
- Even though that's not my main thing

5112
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:11,579
or even close to the main thing.

5113
02:45:11,579 --> 02:45:14,583
But I feel like you need to
keep learning this stuff.

5114
02:45:15,719 --> 02:45:19,260
And even if you don't
choose to use it long term,

5115
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:21,120
you need to give it a chance.

5116
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:23,910
So your understanding
of the world expands.

5117
02:45:23,909 --> 02:45:24,869
- Yeah, you wanna understand

5118
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:26,040
the new technological concepts

5119
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:27,780
and see if they can benefit you.

5120
02:45:27,780 --> 02:45:29,793
It would be stupid not to even try it.

5121
02:45:29,792 --> 02:45:31,139
- It's more about the concepts

5122
02:45:31,139 --> 02:45:32,840
I would say than the actual tools.

5123
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:35,940
Like expanding, and that
could be a challenging thing.

5124
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:38,130
So going to VS Code and
like really learning it,

5125
02:45:38,129 --> 02:45:39,536
like all the shortcuts,
all the extensions,

5126
02:45:39,537 --> 02:45:42,780
and actually installing different
stuff and playing with it.

5127
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:44,430
That was a interesting challenge.

5128
02:45:44,430 --> 02:45:45,925
It was uncomfortable at first.

5129
02:45:45,924 --> 02:45:48,449
- Yeah, for me too, yeah.
- Yeah, but you just dive in.

5130
02:45:48,450 --> 02:45:49,409
- It's like neuro flex,

5131
02:45:49,409 --> 02:45:50,753
like you keep your brain fresh,

5132
02:45:50,753 --> 02:45:52,041
like this kind of stuff.

5133
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:53,459
- I gotta do that more.

5134
02:45:53,459 --> 02:45:56,009
Have you given React a chance? (laughs)

5135
02:45:56,010 --> 02:45:57,600
- No, but I wanna learn

5136
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:59,882
and I understand the basics, right?

5137
02:46:01,739 --> 02:46:03,479
I don't really know where to start.

5138
02:46:03,479 --> 02:46:06,600
- But would you like, I guess
you gotta use your own model,

5139
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:09,210
which is like build the thing using it.

5140
02:46:09,209 --> 02:46:11,279
- No, man, so I kind of did that.

5141
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:12,950
- Yeah.
- The stuff I do

5142
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:14,700
in jQuery is essentially,

5143
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:16,530
a lot of it is like,

5144
02:46:16,530 --> 02:46:20,070
I start rebuilding whatever
tech is already out there.

5145
02:46:20,069 --> 02:46:20,903
Not based on that,

5146
02:46:20,903 --> 02:46:21,870
but just on accident.
- Yeah.

5147
02:46:21,870 --> 02:46:23,579
- I keep coding long enough
that I built the same,

5148
02:46:23,579 --> 02:46:26,069
I start getting the same
problems everybody else has,

5149
02:46:26,069 --> 02:46:27,539
and you start building the
same frameworks kind of.

5150
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:29,630
So essentially, I use my
own kind of framework of.

5151
02:46:29,629 --> 02:46:31,469
- So you basically build
a framework from scratch

5152
02:46:31,469 --> 02:46:32,849
that's your own, that you understand it?

5153
02:46:32,850 --> 02:46:33,683
- Kinda yeah.

5154
02:46:33,683 --> 02:46:36,060
With HX calls, but essentially
it's the same thing.

5155
02:46:36,059 --> 02:46:38,040
Look, I don't have the time.

5156
02:46:38,040 --> 02:46:39,989
I think saying you don't have the time

5157
02:46:39,989 --> 02:46:40,979
is like always a lie,

5158
02:46:40,979 --> 02:46:43,081
'cause you just don't
prioritize it enough.

5159
02:46:43,081 --> 02:46:46,049
My priority is still like
the running the businesses

5160
02:46:46,049 --> 02:46:47,429
and improving that and AI.

5161
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:49,200
I think learning AI is
much more valuable now

5162
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:51,720
than learning a front end framework.

5163
02:46:51,719 --> 02:46:53,639
Yeah, It's just more impact.

5164
02:46:53,639 --> 02:46:56,219
- I guess you should be just learning

5165
02:46:56,219 --> 02:46:58,469
every single day a thing.

5166
02:46:58,469 --> 02:46:59,849
- Yeah, you can learn
a little bit every day.

5167
02:46:59,850 --> 02:47:01,260
- Yeah.
- Like a little bit of React,

5168
02:47:01,260 --> 02:47:03,389
or I think now, like Next very big.

5169
02:47:03,389 --> 02:47:05,354
So learn a little bit of Next.

5170
02:47:05,354 --> 02:47:07,518
But I call them the
military industrial complex.

5171
02:47:07,518 --> 02:47:09,537
But you need to know,

5172
02:47:09,537 --> 02:47:11,068
you need to know it anyway.

5173
02:47:11,068 --> 02:47:13,904
- You gotta learn how to
use the weapons of war

5174
02:47:13,905 --> 02:47:15,480
and then you can be peacenik.

5175
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:17,610
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I mean,

5176
02:47:17,610 --> 02:47:20,489
but you gotta learn it
in the same exact way

5177
02:47:20,489 --> 02:47:21,539
as we were talking about,

5178
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:24,027
which is learning by trying
to build something with it

5179
02:47:24,027 --> 02:47:25,469
and actually deploy it.

5180
02:47:25,469 --> 02:47:26,789
- The frameworks are so complicated

5181
02:47:26,790 --> 02:47:28,230
and it changes so fast.

5182
02:47:28,229 --> 02:47:30,299
So it's like, where do I start?

5183
02:47:30,299 --> 02:47:31,619
And I guess it's the same thing

5184
02:47:31,620 --> 02:47:33,180
when you're starting out making websites.

5185
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:34,590
Where do you start?

5186
02:47:34,590 --> 02:47:35,853
Ask GPT-4, I guess.

5187
02:47:37,057 --> 02:47:38,940
Yeah, it's just so dynamic.

5188
02:47:38,940 --> 02:47:39,773
It changes so fast that,

5189
02:47:39,772 --> 02:47:42,406
and I dunno if it would be a
good idea for me to learn it.

5190
02:47:43,620 --> 02:47:45,360
Maybe some combination of like,

5191
02:47:45,360 --> 02:47:48,278
few Next with PHP Laravel.

5192
02:47:48,278 --> 02:47:50,520
Laravel is like a framework for PHP.

5193
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,140
I think that would be...

5194
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:53,909
It could benefit me.

5195
02:47:53,909 --> 02:47:55,079
Maybe Tailwind for CSS,

5196
02:47:55,079 --> 02:47:56,670
like a styling engine.

5197
02:47:56,670 --> 02:47:58,680
That stuff could probably save me time.

5198
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:00,450
- Yeah, but like you won't know

5199
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:01,527
until you really give it a try.

5200
02:48:01,527 --> 02:48:04,110
And it feels like you have to build,

5201
02:48:04,110 --> 02:48:05,487
if maybe I'm talking to myself,

5202
02:48:05,486 --> 02:48:09,119
but I should probably recode

5203
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:12,787
like my personal one page in Laravel.

5204
02:48:12,787 --> 02:48:13,680
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5205
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,840
- And even though it might not have almost

5206
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,569
any dynamic elements, maybe
have one dynamic element,

5207
02:48:18,569 --> 02:48:21,629
but it has to go end to
end in that framework.

5208
02:48:21,629 --> 02:48:22,462
- Yeah.

5209
02:48:22,462 --> 02:48:23,969
- Or like end to end build in Node.js.

5210
02:48:23,969 --> 02:48:26,279
Some of it is, I don't...

5211
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:28,320
Figuring out how to even deploy the thing.

5212
02:48:28,319 --> 02:48:29,309
- I have no idea.
- Full stack.

5213
02:48:29,309 --> 02:48:31,500
- All I know is right now
I would send it to GitHub

5214
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:32,549
and it sends it to my server.

5215
02:48:32,549 --> 02:48:34,649
I don't know how to
get JavaScript running.

5216
02:48:34,649 --> 02:48:36,149
I have no clue.
- Yeah.

5217
02:48:36,149 --> 02:48:39,359
- So I guess I need like a pass,

5218
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:40,890
like first an array,

5219
02:48:40,889 --> 02:48:43,842
or Heroku kind of those kind of platforms.

5220
02:48:43,843 --> 02:48:47,856
- I actually kind of just
gave myself the idea of like,

5221
02:48:47,856 --> 02:48:50,763
I kind of just wanna
build a single webpage.

5222
02:48:51,690 --> 02:48:55,920
Like one webpage that
has one dynamic element

5223
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:57,719
and just do it in every single,

5224
02:48:57,719 --> 02:48:58,673
in a lot of frameworks.

5225
02:48:58,674 --> 02:49:01,080
Like just-
- Ah, on the same page.

5226
02:49:01,079 --> 02:49:02,680
- Same exact page.
- All the same?

5227
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:03,764
- Kinda page.
- It's smart.

5228
02:49:03,763 --> 02:49:04,822
That's a cool project.

5229
02:49:04,823 --> 02:49:05,873
You can learn all these frameworks.

5230
02:49:05,873 --> 02:49:06,707
- Yeah.
- And you can see

5231
02:49:06,707 --> 02:49:07,540
the differences.

5232
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:08,820
- Yeah.
- That's interesting, right?

5233
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:09,653
- That how long it takes to do it.

5234
02:49:09,653 --> 02:49:10,800
- Yeah, stopwatch, yeah, yeah.

5235
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:12,359
- I have to figure out actually

5236
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:14,147
something sufficiently complicated,

5237
02:49:14,147 --> 02:49:16,670
'cause it should probably do,

5238
02:49:16,670 --> 02:49:19,829
it should probably do some kind of thing

5239
02:49:19,829 --> 02:49:21,600
where it accesses the database

5240
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,172
and dynamically changing stuff.

5241
02:49:23,172 --> 02:49:25,200
- Some AI stuff, some LLM stuff.

5242
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:26,220
- Yeah, maybe some,

5243
02:49:26,219 --> 02:49:27,788
it doesn't have to be AI LLM but maybe-

5244
02:49:27,789 --> 02:49:29,623
- Do an API call.
- API call to something.

5245
02:49:29,623 --> 02:49:31,199
- Yeah, to replicate, for example.

5246
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:33,370
And then that would be
a very cool project.

5247
02:49:33,370 --> 02:49:34,890
- Yeah, yeah.

5248
02:49:34,889 --> 02:49:38,550
And like time it and also
report on my happiness.

5249
02:49:38,550 --> 02:49:39,384
- Yeah.

5250
02:49:39,384 --> 02:49:41,250
- I'm gonna totally do this

5251
02:49:41,250 --> 02:49:42,479
- Because nobody benchmarks this.

5252
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:44,969
Nobody's benchmark developer
happiness with frameworks.

5253
02:49:44,969 --> 02:49:45,802
- [Lex] Yeah

5254
02:49:45,802 --> 02:49:47,278
- Nobody's benchmarked the shipping time.

5255
02:49:47,278 --> 02:49:49,380
- Just take like a month and do this.

5256
02:49:49,379 --> 02:49:51,269
How many frameworks are there?

5257
02:49:51,270 --> 02:49:52,103
How many?

5258
02:49:52,950 --> 02:49:55,290
There's like five main ways of doing it.

5259
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:57,150
So there's like, this is no...

5260
02:49:57,149 --> 02:49:58,272
There's backend, frontend.

5261
02:49:58,272 --> 02:49:59,670
- And this stuff confused me too.

5262
02:49:59,670 --> 02:50:01,979
Like React now apparently
has become backend.

5263
02:50:01,979 --> 02:50:02,813
- [Lex] Yeah.

5264
02:50:02,813 --> 02:50:04,200
- Or something used to be on frontend,

5265
02:50:04,200 --> 02:50:06,060
and you're forced to do now backend also.

5266
02:50:06,059 --> 02:50:07,170
I don't know.

5267
02:50:07,170 --> 02:50:08,003
But there's not really,

5268
02:50:08,003 --> 02:50:09,840
you're not really forced to do anything.

5269
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:12,540
So according to the internet,

5270
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:13,917
so like there's no...

5271
02:50:13,916 --> 02:50:15,389
It's actually not trivial

5272
02:50:15,389 --> 02:50:17,639
to find the canonical way of doing things.

5273
02:50:17,639 --> 02:50:19,537
So like the standard vanilla-
- Yeah.

5274
02:50:19,537 --> 02:50:21,239
- You go to the ice cream shop,

5275
02:50:21,239 --> 02:50:22,949
there's like a million flavors.

5276
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:24,210
I want vanilla.

5277
02:50:24,209 --> 02:50:27,269
If I've never had ice cream in my life,

5278
02:50:27,270 --> 02:50:29,868
can we just like learn about ice cream?

5279
02:50:29,868 --> 02:50:32,220
- Yeah.
- I want vanilla.

5280
02:50:32,219 --> 02:50:33,299
Nobody actually,

5281
02:50:33,299 --> 02:50:35,459
sometimes they'll
literally name it vanilla.

5282
02:50:35,459 --> 02:50:38,189
But I wanna know what's the basic way,

5283
02:50:38,190 --> 02:50:40,829
but not like dumb,

5284
02:50:40,829 --> 02:50:41,906
but the standard canonical common.

5285
02:50:41,906 --> 02:50:43,889
- Yeah, I know the dominant way-

5286
02:50:43,889 --> 02:50:44,722
- [Lex] Yeah, the dominant way.

5287
02:50:44,722 --> 02:50:46,289
- 60% of developers do it like this.

5288
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:47,123
- [Lex] Yeah.

5289
02:50:47,122 --> 02:50:47,956
- It's hard to figure that out,

5290
02:50:47,956 --> 02:50:49,680
that's the problem.

5291
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:51,930
- Yeah, maybe LLMs can help.

5292
02:50:51,930 --> 02:50:54,173
Maybe you should explicitly
ask what is the dominant?

5293
02:50:54,173 --> 02:50:56,220
- Because they usually know the dominant,

5294
02:50:56,219 --> 02:50:57,052
they give answers-
- Yeah.

5295
02:50:57,052 --> 02:50:59,319
- That are like the most probable kind of.

5296
02:50:59,319 --> 02:51:00,690
- Yeah.
- So that makes sense

5297
02:51:00,690 --> 02:51:01,523
to ask LLM.

5298
02:51:02,969 --> 02:51:05,250
I think honestly, maybe what would help is

5299
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:08,010
if you wanna learn or I would
wanna learn a framework.

5300
02:51:08,010 --> 02:51:10,079
Hire somebody that already does it

5301
02:51:10,079 --> 02:51:11,520
and just sit with them

5302
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:13,290
and make something together.

5303
02:51:13,290 --> 02:51:15,150
I've never done that, but
I've thought about it.

5304
02:51:15,149 --> 02:51:17,310
So it would be a very fast way to

5305
02:51:17,310 --> 02:51:19,829
take their knowledge put them in my brain.

5306
02:51:19,829 --> 02:51:20,969
- I've tried these kinds of things.

5307
02:51:20,969 --> 02:51:23,340
What happens is it depends what kind of,

5308
02:51:23,340 --> 02:51:25,770
if they're like a world
class developer, yes.

5309
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:29,159
Oftentimes they themselves
are used to that thing

5310
02:51:29,159 --> 02:51:32,399
and they have not themselves
explored in other options.

5311
02:51:32,399 --> 02:51:35,369
So they're have this
dogmatic talking down to you,

5312
02:51:35,370 --> 02:51:36,630
- [Pieter] Yeah. (laughs)

5313
02:51:36,629 --> 02:51:37,960
- This is the right way to do it.

5314
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:39,310
- Yeah.
- It's like, no, no, no.

5315
02:51:39,310 --> 02:51:40,799
We're just like exploring together.

5316
02:51:40,799 --> 02:51:43,052
Okay, show me the cool thing you've tried,

5317
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:48,273
which is like, it has to
have open-mindedness to like,

5318
02:51:49,170 --> 02:51:53,579
Node.js is not the right
way to do web development.

5319
02:51:53,579 --> 02:51:55,020
It's like one way.

5320
02:51:55,020 --> 02:51:59,283
And there's nothing wrong
with the old lamp, PHP,

5321
02:52:00,288 --> 02:52:03,090
jQuery, vanilla JavaScript way.

5322
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:04,590
It just has its pros and cons,

5323
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:05,423
and like-
- Yeah.

5324
02:52:05,423 --> 02:52:06,256
- You really you need to
know what the pros and cons.

5325
02:52:06,255 --> 02:52:07,088
- Those people exist.

5326
02:52:07,088 --> 02:52:08,639
You could find those people probably.

5327
02:52:08,639 --> 02:52:10,590
- Yeah.
- If you wanna learn AI,

5328
02:52:10,590 --> 02:52:12,094
imagine you have Karpathy
sitting next to you-

5329
02:52:12,094 --> 02:52:12,927
- Yeah.

5330
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:14,489
- Teach you, like he does
these YouTube videos.

5331
02:52:14,489 --> 02:52:15,323
It's amazing.

5332
02:52:15,323 --> 02:52:17,250
He can teach it to like a five-year-old

5333
02:52:17,250 --> 02:52:18,989
about how to make LLM.

5334
02:52:18,989 --> 02:52:20,430
It's amazing.

5335
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:21,263
Imagine this guy sitting next to you

5336
02:52:21,263 --> 02:52:22,350
and just teaching you like,

5337
02:52:22,350 --> 02:52:23,643
let's make LLM together.

5338
02:52:24,659 --> 02:52:26,069
Holy shit, it would be amazing.

5339
02:52:26,069 --> 02:52:30,149
- Yeah, I mean, well,
Karpathy has its own style

5340
02:52:30,149 --> 02:52:32,909
and is like, I'm not
sure he's for everybody,

5341
02:52:32,909 --> 02:52:34,079
for example, a five-year-old.

5342
02:52:34,079 --> 02:52:35,309
It depends on the five-year-old.

5343
02:52:35,309 --> 02:52:37,680
- Yeah.
- He's like super technical,

5344
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:38,513
- But he's amazing,

5345
02:52:38,513 --> 02:52:39,346
'cause he's super technical

5346
02:52:39,345 --> 02:52:40,260
and he's the only one who can explain-

5347
02:52:40,260 --> 02:52:42,479
- Yes.
- The stuff in a simple way,

5348
02:52:42,479 --> 02:52:44,520
which shows his complete genius.

5349
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:45,870
- Yes.
- 'Cause if you can

5350
02:52:45,870 --> 02:52:46,703
explain without jargon-
- No BS.

5351
02:52:46,702 --> 02:52:48,779
- You're like, wow.

5352
02:52:48,780 --> 02:52:52,470
- And build it from scratch.
- Yeah. it's like top tier.

5353
02:52:52,469 --> 02:52:53,302
What a guy!

5354
02:52:53,302 --> 02:52:55,979
- But he might be anti-framework

5355
02:52:55,979 --> 02:52:56,813
'cause he builds from scratch.

5356
02:52:56,813 --> 02:52:57,646
- Actually, exactly, yeah.

5357
02:52:57,646 --> 02:52:59,132
Actually he probably is, yeah.

5358
02:53:00,090 --> 02:53:01,659
- He's like you, but for AI.

5359
02:53:01,659 --> 02:53:02,969
- Yeah, so maybe learning a framework

5360
02:53:02,969 --> 02:53:04,529
is a very bad idea for us.

5361
02:53:04,530 --> 02:53:06,561
Maybe we should stay in PHP,

5362
02:53:06,561 --> 02:53:08,309
and like Script kiddie and the-

5363
02:53:08,309 --> 02:53:09,143
- But you have to...

5364
02:53:09,143 --> 02:53:10,620
Maybe by learning the framework,

5365
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:13,590
you learn what you want to yourself,

5366
02:53:13,590 --> 02:53:14,700
build from scratch.

5367
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:15,690
- Yeah, maybe you learn concepts,

5368
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:16,523
but you don't actually

5369
02:53:16,522 --> 02:53:17,549
have to start using it
for your life, right?

5370
02:53:17,549 --> 02:53:18,449
Yeah, yeah.

5371
02:53:18,450 --> 02:53:21,540
- And you're still a Mac
guy or was a Mac guy?

5372
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:24,229
- Yeah, yeah, I switched to Mac in 2014,

5373
02:53:24,228 --> 02:53:26,459
'cause when I wanted to start traveling

5374
02:53:26,459 --> 02:53:28,169
and my brother was like,
"Dude, get a MacBook.

5375
02:53:28,170 --> 02:53:29,460
It's like the standard now."

5376
02:53:29,459 --> 02:53:31,169
I'm like, wow, I need
to switch from Windows.

5377
02:53:31,170 --> 02:53:33,181
And I had like three screens, Windows.

5378
02:53:33,181 --> 02:53:34,014
- [Lex] Yeah.

5379
02:53:34,013 --> 02:53:35,729
- I had this whole setup
for music production.

5380
02:53:35,729 --> 02:53:37,591
I had to sell everything.

5381
02:53:37,591 --> 02:53:39,360
And then I had a MacBook,

5382
02:53:39,360 --> 02:53:41,370
and I remember opening
up this MacBook box,

5383
02:53:41,370 --> 02:53:43,470
like aah,

5384
02:53:43,469 --> 02:53:44,429
and it was so beautiful.

5385
02:53:44,430 --> 02:53:45,263
It was like this aluminum,

5386
02:53:45,263 --> 02:53:46,470
and then I opened it,

5387
02:53:46,469 --> 02:53:48,536
I removed the screen protector thing.

5388
02:53:48,537 --> 02:53:49,770
And it's so beautiful.

5389
02:53:49,770 --> 02:53:50,983
And I didn't touch it for three days.

5390
02:53:50,983 --> 02:53:52,360
I was just like, looking at it.

5391
02:53:52,360 --> 02:53:53,193
- Yeah.
- Really.

5392
02:53:53,192 --> 02:53:54,179
And I was still on the Windows computer.

5393
02:53:54,180 --> 02:53:56,430
And then I went traveling with that.

5394
02:53:56,430 --> 02:53:59,370
And all my great things
started when I switched to Mac,

5395
02:53:59,370 --> 02:54:00,781
which sounds very dogmatic, right?

5396
02:54:00,781 --> 02:54:03,000
- What great things are you talking about?

5397
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:04,143
- All the business started working out.

5398
02:54:04,143 --> 02:54:05,280
I started traveling.

5399
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:07,240
I started building startups.

5400
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:08,370
I started making money.

5401
02:54:08,370 --> 02:54:10,110
It all started when I switched to Mac.

5402
02:54:10,110 --> 02:54:12,200
- Listen, I kinda...

5403
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:15,329
You're making me wanna switch to Mac.

5404
02:54:15,329 --> 02:54:18,899
So I either use Linux
inside Windows with WSL

5405
02:54:18,899 --> 02:54:19,859
or just-
- Yeah.

5406
02:54:19,860 --> 02:54:21,239
- Ubuntu, Linux.

5407
02:54:21,239 --> 02:54:22,949
But Windows for most stuff,

5408
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:26,689
like editing or any Adobe products.

5409
02:54:26,689 --> 02:54:28,170
- Adobe stuff, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5410
02:54:28,170 --> 02:54:29,100
Well you could use,

5411
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:30,351
I guess you could do Mac stuff there.

5412
02:54:30,351 --> 02:54:32,250
- Yeah.
- I wonder if I should switch.

5413
02:54:32,250 --> 02:54:33,389
What do you miss about Windows?

5414
02:54:33,389 --> 02:54:35,309
What was the pros and cons?

5415
02:54:35,309 --> 02:54:36,869
- I think the Finder is horrible in Mac.

5416
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:38,093
- What is horrible?
- The Finder.

5417
02:54:39,363 --> 02:54:40,197
Oh, you don't know the Finder?

5418
02:54:40,197 --> 02:54:41,280
So there's the Windows Explorer.

5419
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:43,078
- Yeah.
- Windows Explorer is amazing.

5420
02:54:43,077 --> 02:54:43,911
- Thank you for talking down.

5421
02:54:43,911 --> 02:54:44,744
- Finder is strange, man.

5422
02:54:44,744 --> 02:54:45,712
There's like strange things.

5423
02:54:45,712 --> 02:54:48,180
There's this bug where if you send,

5424
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:50,670
like, attach a photo in
WhatsApp or Telegram,

5425
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:52,229
it just selects the whole folder

5426
02:54:52,229 --> 02:54:54,270
and you almost accidentally
can click Enter

5427
02:54:54,270 --> 02:54:56,399
and you send all your
photos, all your files

5428
02:54:56,399 --> 02:54:58,979
to this chat group,
happened to my girlfriend.

5429
02:54:58,979 --> 02:55:01,500
She starts sending me photo,
photo, photo, photo, photo.

5430
02:55:01,500 --> 02:55:05,069
So Finder is very
unusable, but it has Linux.

5431
02:55:05,069 --> 02:55:06,899
The whole thing is like,
it's Unix based, right?

5432
02:55:06,899 --> 02:55:08,381
- So you use the command like?

5433
02:55:08,381 --> 02:55:09,443
- Yeah, all the time.

5434
02:55:09,443 --> 02:55:10,320
Like all the time.

5435
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:12,421
And the cool thing is you can run,

5436
02:55:12,421 --> 02:55:14,670
I think it's like Unix,
like Debian or whatever.

5437
02:55:14,670 --> 02:55:17,790
You can run most Linux stuff on macOS,

5438
02:55:17,790 --> 02:55:20,250
which makes this very
good for developments.

5439
02:55:20,250 --> 02:55:22,448
I have my Nginx server,

5440
02:55:22,448 --> 02:55:25,290
if I'm not lazy and set up
my staging on my laptop,

5441
02:55:25,290 --> 02:55:27,240
it's just the Nginx server.

5442
02:55:27,239 --> 02:55:29,610
The same as I have on
my cloud server, right?

5443
02:55:29,610 --> 02:55:31,170
The same way the websites run.

5444
02:55:31,170 --> 02:55:34,020
And I can use almost everything,
the same config files,

5445
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:36,450
configuration files, and it just works.

5446
02:55:36,450 --> 02:55:38,430
And that makes Mac a very good platform

5447
02:55:38,430 --> 02:55:40,950
for Linux stuff, I think.

5448
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:43,110
- Yeah, yeah.

5449
02:55:43,110 --> 02:55:45,420
- Real Ubuntu is like better of course.

5450
02:55:45,420 --> 02:55:49,540
- Yeah, I'm in this
weird situation where I'm

5451
02:55:51,149 --> 02:55:53,129
somewhat of a power user in Windows,

5452
02:55:53,129 --> 02:55:55,829
and let's say Android

5453
02:55:55,829 --> 02:55:59,459
and all the much smarter friends I have

5454
02:55:59,459 --> 02:56:02,519
all using Mac and iPhone.

5455
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:04,770
And it's like-
- If you don't wanna

5456
02:56:04,770 --> 02:56:05,643
go through the peer pressure.

5457
02:56:05,643 --> 02:56:07,020
- It's not peer pressure.

5458
02:56:07,020 --> 02:56:10,920
It's like one of the
reasons I wanna have kids

5459
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:12,202
is that there's a lot of...

5460
02:56:12,202 --> 02:56:15,460
I would love to have kids as a baseline,

5461
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:17,129
but there's like a concern.

5462
02:56:17,129 --> 02:56:18,420
Maybe there's gonna be a trade off,

5463
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:19,253
or all this kind of stuff.

5464
02:56:19,253 --> 02:56:22,409
But you see like these extremely
successful smart people

5465
02:56:22,409 --> 02:56:23,340
who are friends of mine,

5466
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:25,559
who have kids and are
really happy they have kids.

5467
02:56:25,559 --> 02:56:27,000
So that's not peer pressure,

5468
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:28,739
that's just like a strong signal.

5469
02:56:28,739 --> 02:56:29,789
- Yeah, it works for people.

5470
02:56:29,790 --> 02:56:30,840
- That works for people.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5471
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:31,889
And the same thing with Mac.

5472
02:56:31,889 --> 02:56:32,772
It's like-
- Yeah.

5473
02:56:32,772 --> 02:56:35,339
(Lex exhales)

5474
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,930
- I don't see fundamentally,

5475
02:56:36,930 --> 02:56:38,760
I don't like closed systems.

5476
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:41,880
So fundamentally, I like Windows more

5477
02:56:41,879 --> 02:56:43,259
because there's much more freedom.

5478
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:44,852
Same with Android,
there's much more freedom.

5479
02:56:44,852 --> 02:56:45,685
- Yeah.

5480
02:56:45,684 --> 02:56:46,859
- It's much more customizable.

5481
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:51,390
But like all the cool kids,

5482
02:56:51,389 --> 02:56:54,479
the smart kids are using Mac and iPhones.

5483
02:56:54,479 --> 02:56:55,666
All right, I need to really,

5484
02:56:55,666 --> 02:56:57,539
I need to give it a real chance.

5485
02:56:57,540 --> 02:56:58,890
Especially for development,

5486
02:56:58,889 --> 02:57:01,170
since more and more stuff
is done in the cloud anyway.

5487
02:57:01,170 --> 02:57:02,309
- Yeah.
- Well, anyway.

5488
02:57:02,309 --> 02:57:04,350
But it's funny to hear you say all

5489
02:57:04,350 --> 02:57:05,399
the good stuff started happening.

5490
02:57:05,399 --> 02:57:07,649
Maybe I'll be like that guy too.

5491
02:57:07,649 --> 02:57:08,639
When I switched to Mac,

5492
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:09,472
all the good stuff-
- Yeah.

5493
02:57:09,472 --> 02:57:10,306
- Started happening.

5494
02:57:10,306 --> 02:57:11,190
- I think it's just about the hardware.

5495
02:57:11,190 --> 02:57:12,069
It's just much about the software that-

5496
02:57:12,069 --> 02:57:12,989
- Yeah.
- The hardware

5497
02:57:12,989 --> 02:57:13,993
is so well built, right?

5498
02:57:13,993 --> 02:57:15,329
A keyboard and-
- Yeah.

5499
02:57:15,329 --> 02:57:16,409
But look at the keyboard I use.

5500
02:57:16,409 --> 02:57:17,852
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

5501
02:57:19,079 --> 02:57:21,120
- That's one word for it.

5502
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:23,130
What's your favorite place to work?

5503
02:57:23,129 --> 02:57:24,659
- On the couch.

5504
02:57:24,659 --> 02:57:25,950
Does the couch matter?

5505
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:28,079
Is the couch at home or is it any couch?

5506
02:57:28,079 --> 02:57:30,120
- No, like hotel couch also.

5507
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:31,060
In the room, right?
- In the room.

5508
02:57:31,059 --> 02:57:33,269
- Yeah, but I used to work
like very ergonomically

5509
02:57:33,270 --> 02:57:34,680
with like a standing desk.

5510
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:36,210
- Yeah.
- And everything like perfect,

5511
02:57:36,209 --> 02:57:38,729
like eye height, screen, blah, blah, blah.

5512
02:57:38,729 --> 02:57:41,699
And I felt like, man, this
has to do with lifting too.

5513
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:44,370
I started getting RSI like
repetitive strain injury,

5514
02:57:44,370 --> 02:57:45,270
like tingling stuff.

5515
02:57:45,270 --> 02:57:46,676
And it would go all the way on my back.

5516
02:57:46,676 --> 02:57:48,959
And I was sitting in a
coworking space like 6:00 AM,

5517
02:57:48,959 --> 02:57:53,009
sun comes up and I'm
working and I'm coding,

5518
02:57:53,010 --> 02:57:53,843
and I hear like a sound or something.

5519
02:57:53,843 --> 02:57:55,650
So I do like, I look left

5520
02:57:55,649 --> 02:57:58,609
and my neck gets stuck
like (imitates cracking)

5521
02:57:58,609 --> 02:57:59,809
and I'm like, wow, fuck!

5522
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:02,449
(Lex laughs)

5523
02:58:02,449 --> 02:58:03,596
And I'm like, am I dying?

5524
02:58:03,596 --> 02:58:04,430
And I thought,
(Lex laughs)

5525
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:05,263
I'm probably dying.

5526
02:58:05,263 --> 02:58:06,096
- Yeah, probably dying.

5527
02:58:06,095 --> 02:58:07,109
- I don't wanna die in a cowork space.

5528
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,760
I'm gonna go home and die in like-

5529
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:10,469
- Yeah.
- Peace and honor.

5530
02:58:10,469 --> 02:58:12,809
- Yeah.
- So I closed my laptop,

5531
02:58:12,809 --> 02:58:13,868
and I put it in my backpack.

5532
02:58:13,868 --> 02:58:15,733
- Yeah.
- And I walked to the street.

5533
02:58:15,733 --> 02:58:17,520
I got on my motorbike, went home.

5534
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:19,229
- Yeah.
- And I lie down

5535
02:58:19,229 --> 02:58:20,879
on like a pillow,

5536
02:58:20,879 --> 02:58:22,322
with my legs up and stuff,

5537
02:58:23,159 --> 02:58:24,780
to get rid of this like,

5538
02:58:24,780 --> 02:58:25,890
'cause it was my whole back.

5539
02:58:25,889 --> 02:58:28,049
And it was because I was
working like this all the time.

5540
02:58:28,049 --> 02:58:30,359
- Yeah.
- So I started getting like a,

5541
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:31,650
a laptop stand, everything.

5542
02:58:31,649 --> 02:58:33,959
Ergonomically correct.

5543
02:58:33,959 --> 02:58:36,750
But then I started lifting and since then,

5544
02:58:36,750 --> 02:58:38,936
it seems like everything
gets straightened out.

5545
02:58:38,936 --> 02:58:41,819
Your posture kinda, you're more straight.

5546
02:58:41,819 --> 02:58:45,180
And I never have RSI
anymore, repetitive injury.

5547
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:47,639
I never have tingling anymore.

5548
02:58:47,639 --> 02:58:49,289
No pains and stuff.

5549
02:58:49,290 --> 02:58:52,460
So then I started working
on the sofa and it's great.

5550
02:58:52,459 --> 02:58:56,485
It feels close to the...

5551
02:58:56,486 --> 02:58:58,560
I sit like this.

5552
02:58:58,559 --> 02:58:59,393
- Yeah.
- Legs together

5553
02:58:59,393 --> 02:59:01,620
and then a pillow and then a laptop.

5554
02:59:01,620 --> 02:59:02,453
And then I work.

5555
02:59:02,452 --> 02:59:04,439
- Are you like leaning back?

5556
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:07,290
- I'm kind of like, together like legs,

5557
02:59:07,290 --> 02:59:08,772
and then-
- Where's the mouse?

5558
02:59:08,772 --> 02:59:13,140
- No, so everything is tracked
on the macOs, the MacBook.

5559
02:59:13,139 --> 02:59:15,329
I used to have the Logitech MX mouse,

5560
02:59:15,329 --> 02:59:16,712
the perfect ergonomic mouse.

5561
02:59:16,712 --> 02:59:19,049
So you're just doing like this
little thing with the thing.

5562
02:59:19,049 --> 02:59:20,549
- Yes.
- One screen.

5563
02:59:20,549 --> 02:59:21,449
- One screen.

5564
02:59:21,450 --> 02:59:23,220
And I used to have three screens.

5565
02:59:23,219 --> 02:59:24,119
I know where people come from.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5566
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:26,280
- I had all the stuff,

5567
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:28,950
but then I realized that
having it all condensed

5568
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:30,720
in one laptop, it's a 16 inch MacBook.

5569
02:59:30,719 --> 02:59:31,552
So it's quite big.

5570
02:59:31,552 --> 02:59:33,270
But having it one there is amazing,

5571
02:59:33,270 --> 02:59:35,550
'cause you're so close to the tools,

5572
02:59:35,549 --> 02:59:37,109
you're so close to what's happening.

5573
02:59:37,110 --> 02:59:39,423
It's like working on a car or something.

5574
02:59:42,030 --> 02:59:43,890
Man, if you have trees, you to look here,

5575
02:59:43,889 --> 02:59:46,189
look there, you get also
neck injury actually.

5576
02:59:47,370 --> 02:59:48,203
- Well, I don't know.

5577
02:59:48,202 --> 02:59:49,590
This sounds like you're part of a cult,

5578
02:59:49,590 --> 02:59:51,489
and you're just trying to convince me.

5579
02:59:52,829 --> 02:59:53,940
I mean, but it's good to hear

5580
02:59:53,940 --> 02:59:56,059
that you can be ultra
productive on a single screen.

5581
02:59:56,058 --> 02:59:57,509
- Yeah.
- I mean that's crazy.

5582
02:59:57,510 --> 02:59:59,040
- Come on tap, you all tap,

5583
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,380
Windows is all up tap,
macros Command + Tap,

5584
03:00:01,379 --> 03:00:03,329
you switch very fast.
- So you have like one,

5585
03:00:03,329 --> 03:00:05,430
the entire screen is taken out by VS Code.

5586
03:00:05,430 --> 03:00:06,809
Say you look at the code and then-

5587
03:00:06,809 --> 03:00:07,643
- Yeah.

5588
03:00:07,643 --> 03:00:10,049
- And then if you deploy
like a website, you what?

5589
03:00:10,049 --> 03:00:10,882
Switch screens.

5590
03:00:10,882 --> 03:00:11,969
- Command + Tap to Chrome.

5591
03:00:11,969 --> 03:00:13,109
I used to have this swipe screen,

5592
03:00:13,110 --> 03:00:15,311
you could do like different screen.

5593
03:00:15,311 --> 03:00:16,680
- Yeah, yeah.
- Spaces.

5594
03:00:16,680 --> 03:00:17,513
- Yeah.
- I was like,

5595
03:00:17,513 --> 03:00:18,900
"Ah, it's too difficult."

5596
03:00:18,899 --> 03:00:21,379
Let's just put it all on one
screen on the MacBook and then.

5597
03:00:21,379 --> 03:00:23,579
- And you can be productive that way?

5598
03:00:23,579 --> 03:00:25,649
- Yeah, very productive, yeah.

5599
03:00:25,649 --> 03:00:28,049
More productive than before.
- Interesting.

5600
03:00:28,049 --> 03:00:29,399
Because I have three screens,

5601
03:00:29,399 --> 03:00:31,079
then two of them are vertical.

5602
03:00:31,079 --> 03:00:32,039
Like on the size?
- Yeah, code,

5603
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:33,090
right, yeah.
- For the code,

5604
03:00:33,090 --> 03:00:34,260
you can see a lot.
- Yeah.

5605
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:35,242
No man, I love it.

5606
03:00:35,242 --> 03:00:36,753
I love seeing it with friends.

5607
03:00:36,753 --> 03:00:38,170
They have amazing like
battle stations, right?

5608
03:00:38,170 --> 03:00:39,329
- Yeah.
- It's called.

5609
03:00:39,329 --> 03:00:40,500
It's amazing.

5610
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:41,389
I want it but I don't want it, right?

5611
03:00:41,389 --> 03:00:44,099
- So you like the constraints.

5612
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:44,933
- [Pieter] That's it.

5613
03:00:44,933 --> 03:00:46,500
- There's some aspect of the constraints,

5614
03:00:46,500 --> 03:00:48,387
which like once you get good at it,

5615
03:00:48,387 --> 03:00:49,833
you can focus your mind and you can.

5616
03:00:49,833 --> 03:00:52,350
- Man, I'm suspicious of like more.

5617
03:00:52,350 --> 03:00:53,183
- Yeah.

5618
03:00:53,183 --> 03:00:54,016
- Do you really need all the stuff?

5619
03:00:54,015 --> 03:00:55,350
It might slow me down, actually.

5620
03:00:55,350 --> 03:00:56,309
- It's a good way to put it.

5621
03:00:56,309 --> 03:00:58,519
I'm suspicious of more, me too.

5622
03:00:58,519 --> 03:00:59,352
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5623
03:00:59,352 --> 03:01:01,756
- I'm suspicious of more in all ways,

5624
03:01:01,755 --> 03:01:02,588
in all walks of life.

5625
03:01:02,588 --> 03:01:03,422
- 'Cause you can defend more, right?

5626
03:01:03,422 --> 03:01:04,255
You can defend.

5627
03:01:04,254 --> 03:01:05,489
Yeah, I'm a developer, I make money.

5628
03:01:05,489 --> 03:01:06,516
I need to get more screens, right?

5629
03:01:06,516 --> 03:01:08,639
I need to be more efficient.

5630
03:01:08,639 --> 03:01:11,250
And then you read stuff
about "Mythical Man-Month,"

5631
03:01:11,250 --> 03:01:12,930
where like hiring more people

5632
03:01:12,930 --> 03:01:16,079
slows down a software
project that's famous.

5633
03:01:16,079 --> 03:01:18,797
Think you can use a metaphor
maybe for tools as well.

5634
03:01:18,797 --> 03:01:21,510
Then I see friends just with
gear acquisition syndrome

5635
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:23,250
that buying so much stuff,

5636
03:01:23,250 --> 03:01:24,750
but they're not that productive.

5637
03:01:24,750 --> 03:01:27,659
They have the best, most
beautiful battle stations,

5638
03:01:27,659 --> 03:01:29,159
desktops, everything.

5639
03:01:29,159 --> 03:01:30,389
They're not that productive.

5640
03:01:30,389 --> 03:01:31,222
And it's also like kind of fun.

5641
03:01:31,222 --> 03:01:32,979
It's all from my laptop
in a backpack, right?

5642
03:01:32,979 --> 03:01:35,159
- Yeah.
- It's kinda nomad minimalist.

5643
03:01:35,159 --> 03:01:36,780
- Take me through like the perfect

5644
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:38,480
ultra productive day in your life.

5645
03:01:40,379 --> 03:01:43,469
Say like where you get a lot of shit done.

5646
03:01:43,469 --> 03:01:44,302
- Yeah.

5647
03:01:45,647 --> 03:01:48,167
- And it's all focused
on getting shit done.

5648
03:01:48,167 --> 03:01:49,680
When are you waking up?

5649
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:51,532
Is it a regular time?

5650
03:01:51,531 --> 03:01:52,649
Super early, super late?

5651
03:01:52,649 --> 03:01:54,427
- Yes, so I go to sleep
like 2:00 AM usually,

5652
03:01:54,427 --> 03:01:55,261
something like that.

5653
03:01:55,261 --> 03:01:56,882
And before 4:00 AM,

5654
03:01:57,719 --> 03:02:00,149
but my girlfriend would go sleep midnight.

5655
03:02:00,149 --> 03:02:02,609
So we did a compromise
like 2:00 AM you know,

5656
03:02:02,610 --> 03:02:04,106
so I wake up around 10, 11.

5657
03:02:04,106 --> 03:02:05,282
The more like 10,

5658
03:02:07,139 --> 03:02:08,699
shower, make coffee,

5659
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:10,260
I make coffee, like drip coffee,

5660
03:02:10,260 --> 03:02:12,360
like the V60, you know the filter.

5661
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:14,760
And I'd boil water and
then I put the coffee in,

5662
03:02:15,870 --> 03:02:18,240
and then chill, live with my girlfriend

5663
03:02:18,239 --> 03:02:20,489
and then open laptops, start coding,

5664
03:02:20,489 --> 03:02:22,617
check what's going on,
like bugs or whatever.

5665
03:02:22,617 --> 03:02:26,040
- How long are you, like
how stretches of time

5666
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:28,590
are you able to just sit
behind the computer coding?

5667
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:30,389
- So I used to need like
really long stretches

5668
03:02:30,389 --> 03:02:31,619
where I would do like all nighters

5669
03:02:31,620 --> 03:02:33,360
and stuff to get shit done.

5670
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:36,450
But I've gotten trained to
like have more interruptions

5671
03:02:36,450 --> 03:02:37,283
where I can like-

5672
03:02:37,282 --> 03:02:38,672
- Because you have to.
- This is life.

5673
03:02:38,673 --> 03:02:41,010
There's a lot of distractions.

5674
03:02:41,010 --> 03:02:42,389
Your girlfriend asks stuff,

5675
03:02:42,389 --> 03:02:44,251
people come over, whatever.
- Yeah.

5676
03:02:44,251 --> 03:02:45,433
- So I'm very fast now,

5677
03:02:45,433 --> 03:02:47,580
I can lock in and lock out quite fast.

5678
03:02:47,579 --> 03:02:49,709
And heard people,
developers or entrepreneurs

5679
03:02:49,709 --> 03:02:51,269
with kids have the same thing.

5680
03:02:51,270 --> 03:02:52,590
Before they're like, ah, I cannot work,

5681
03:02:52,590 --> 03:02:53,639
but they get used to it,

5682
03:02:53,639 --> 03:02:56,189
and they get really
productive in like short time,

5683
03:02:56,190 --> 03:02:58,140
because they only have like 20 minutes

5684
03:02:58,139 --> 03:03:00,149
and then shit goes crazy again.

5685
03:03:00,149 --> 03:03:02,279
So another constraint, right?

5686
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:03,390
- Yeah, it's funny.

5687
03:03:03,389 --> 03:03:05,939
- So I think that works for me, but yeah.

5688
03:03:05,940 --> 03:03:08,370
And then cook food and stuff,

5689
03:03:08,370 --> 03:03:10,606
like have lunch, steak
and chicken and whatever.

5690
03:03:10,606 --> 03:03:12,510
- Do you eat a bunch of times a day?

5691
03:03:12,510 --> 03:03:13,739
So you said coffee.

5692
03:03:13,739 --> 03:03:14,760
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

5693
03:03:14,760 --> 03:03:16,950
- Yeah, so a few hours later cook foods.

5694
03:03:16,950 --> 03:03:18,990
We get like locally
stores like meat and stuff

5695
03:03:18,989 --> 03:03:21,063
and vegetables and cook that,

5696
03:03:22,350 --> 03:03:24,450
and then second coffee
and then go some more.

5697
03:03:24,450 --> 03:03:25,590
Maybe go outside for lunch.

5698
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:27,750
You can mix fun stuff.

5699
03:03:27,750 --> 03:03:29,692
- How many hours are you saying
a perfectly productive day?

5700
03:03:29,692 --> 03:03:31,469
Are you doing programming?

5701
03:03:31,469 --> 03:03:33,040
If you were like to kill it?

5702
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:34,643
Are you doing like all day basically?

5703
03:03:34,644 --> 03:03:36,180
- You mean like the special days

5704
03:03:36,180 --> 03:03:37,013
where like-
- Special days.

5705
03:03:37,013 --> 03:03:39,060
- Girlfriend leaves to
like bears or something,

5706
03:03:39,059 --> 03:03:41,309
and you're alone for a week at home.

5707
03:03:41,309 --> 03:03:42,143
Which is amazing.
- Yes.

5708
03:03:42,143 --> 03:03:43,166
- You can just code.

5709
03:03:43,166 --> 03:03:45,510
And you stay up all night
and eat chocolate and-

5710
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:46,992
- Yeah, chocolate.
- Yeah, you know.

5711
03:03:46,992 --> 03:03:48,329
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

5712
03:03:48,329 --> 03:03:49,829
Let's remove girlfriend from picture.

5713
03:03:49,829 --> 03:03:51,569
Social life from picture.

5714
03:03:51,569 --> 03:03:53,010
It's just you.

5715
03:03:53,010 --> 03:03:54,226
- Man, then goes shit crazy.

5716
03:03:54,226 --> 03:03:55,073
- Yeah, because when shit goes crazy.

5717
03:03:56,049 --> 03:03:56,970
- Yeah, now shit goes crazy.

5718
03:03:56,969 --> 03:03:57,802
- Okay, good.

5719
03:03:59,275 --> 03:04:00,329
Let's rewind.

5720
03:04:00,329 --> 03:04:01,590
Are you still waking up?

5721
03:04:01,590 --> 03:04:03,323
There's coffee, there's
no girlfriend to talk to.

5722
03:04:03,323 --> 03:04:05,033
There's no-
- Now we wake up

5723
03:04:05,033 --> 03:04:06,869
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

5724
03:04:06,870 --> 03:04:08,070
Like 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM.

5725
03:04:09,386 --> 03:04:11,729
(Lex laughs)

5726
03:04:11,729 --> 03:04:13,319
- Because you went to bed at 6:00 AM.

5727
03:04:13,319 --> 03:04:14,549
- Yeah, because I was coding,

5728
03:04:14,549 --> 03:04:16,049
I was finding some new AI shit.

5729
03:04:16,049 --> 03:04:17,849
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I was studying it,

5730
03:04:17,850 --> 03:04:18,683
and it was amazing.

5731
03:04:18,683 --> 03:04:20,280
And I cannot sleep 'cause
it's too important.

5732
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:21,158
We need to stay awake.
- Yeah, yeah.

5733
03:04:21,157 --> 03:04:21,990
- We need to see all of this.

5734
03:04:21,990 --> 03:04:23,806
We need to make something now.

5735
03:04:23,806 --> 03:04:27,390
But that's the times I
do make new stuff more,

5736
03:04:27,389 --> 03:04:29,969
so I think I have a friend,

5737
03:04:29,969 --> 03:04:32,729
he actually books a hotel
for like a week to leave his,

5738
03:04:32,729 --> 03:04:34,109
and he has a kid too,

5739
03:04:34,110 --> 03:04:35,277
and his girlfriend and
his kids stay in the house

5740
03:04:35,277 --> 03:04:37,620
and he goes to another hotel.

5741
03:04:37,620 --> 03:04:38,579
Sounds a little suspicious, right?

5742
03:04:38,579 --> 03:04:39,413
Going to the hotel.

5743
03:04:39,413 --> 03:04:40,246
But all he does
(Lex laughs)

5744
03:04:40,245 --> 03:04:41,879
is like writing or coding.
- Yeah.

5745
03:04:41,879 --> 03:04:42,712
- He's a writer,

5746
03:04:42,712 --> 03:04:45,149
and he needs like this
alone time, this silence.

5747
03:04:45,149 --> 03:04:47,909
And I think for this
flow state, it's true.

5748
03:04:47,909 --> 03:04:49,750
I'm better maintaining stuff

5749
03:04:51,180 --> 03:04:52,170
when there's a lot of disruptions

5750
03:04:52,170 --> 03:04:53,190
then like creating new stuff.

5751
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:54,023
I need this.

5752
03:04:54,022 --> 03:04:55,259
And it's common, it's close.

5753
03:04:55,260 --> 03:04:57,872
It's this uninterrupted period of time.

5754
03:04:59,159 --> 03:05:01,639
So yeah, I wake up like one, 2:00 PM,

5755
03:05:01,639 --> 03:05:03,090
still coffee, shower.

5756
03:05:03,090 --> 03:05:04,389
We still shower, you know,

5757
03:05:05,549 --> 03:05:07,619
and then this code like nonstop.

5758
03:05:07,620 --> 03:05:08,820
Maybe my friends comes over anyway.

5759
03:05:08,819 --> 03:05:11,159
- Just some distraction.

5760
03:05:11,159 --> 03:05:12,899
- Yeah, Andre, he codes too.

5761
03:05:12,899 --> 03:05:14,579
So he comes over, we code together,

5762
03:05:14,579 --> 03:05:15,539
we listen...

5763
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:17,430
It starts going back
to like the Bali days,

5764
03:05:17,430 --> 03:05:18,360
you know, like-
- Yeah.

5765
03:05:18,360 --> 03:05:19,230
- Coworking days.

5766
03:05:19,229 --> 03:05:20,639
- You're not really working with him,

5767
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:21,989
but you're just both working.

5768
03:05:21,989 --> 03:05:23,459
- Because it's nice to have like the vibe

5769
03:05:23,459 --> 03:05:25,589
where you both sit together on the couch

5770
03:05:25,590 --> 03:05:27,690
and coding on something and you actually,

5771
03:05:27,690 --> 03:05:29,637
it's mostly silent or there's music,

5772
03:05:29,637 --> 03:05:31,770
and sometimes you ask something.

5773
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:34,409
But generally, you are really locked in.

5774
03:05:34,409 --> 03:05:36,122
- What music are you listening to?

5775
03:05:37,049 --> 03:05:41,795
- I think like techno,
like YouTube techno.

5776
03:05:41,796 --> 03:05:44,646
There's a channel called HOR with Umlaut,

5777
03:05:44,646 --> 03:05:47,430
HO like double dot.

5778
03:05:47,430 --> 03:05:48,750
It's Berlin techno, whatever.

5779
03:05:48,750 --> 03:05:51,479
It looks like they film
it in like a toilet

5780
03:05:51,479 --> 03:05:52,889
with like white tiles and stuff.

5781
03:05:52,889 --> 03:05:54,248
And it's very cool.

5782
03:05:54,248 --> 03:05:56,489
And they always have like, very good,

5783
03:05:56,489 --> 03:05:58,590
kind of industrial.
- Industrial, so fast phase.

5784
03:05:58,590 --> 03:06:00,368
- Kinda aggressive, like
(imitates techno music)

5785
03:06:00,368 --> 03:06:01,290
- Yeah, yeah.

5786
03:06:01,290 --> 03:06:03,030
That's not distracting to you brain.

5787
03:06:03,030 --> 03:06:04,710
- That's amazing.
- Okay.

5788
03:06:04,709 --> 03:06:06,479
- I think distracting, man, jazz.

5789
03:06:06,479 --> 03:06:08,639
I listen coffee jazz with
my girlfriend when I wake up

5790
03:06:08,639 --> 03:06:10,649
and it's kind of like, this
piano starts getting annoying.

5791
03:06:10,649 --> 03:06:11,483
It's like

5792
03:06:11,483 --> 03:06:13,290
(imitates jazz music).
(Lex laughs)

5793
03:06:13,290 --> 03:06:14,190
It's too many tones.

5794
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:15,360
It's like, too many things go on.

5795
03:06:15,360 --> 03:06:16,193
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah.

5796
03:06:16,192 --> 03:06:17,250
- This industrial techno is like,

5797
03:06:17,250 --> 03:06:19,061
you know, these African rain dances.

5798
03:06:19,061 --> 03:06:20,477
(imitates techno music)

5799
03:06:20,477 --> 03:06:22,320
It's this transcendental-
- Yeah.

5800
03:06:22,319 --> 03:06:23,806
- Trans.
- That's interesting,

5801
03:06:23,807 --> 03:06:28,807
'cause I actually mostly
now listen to brown noise,

5802
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:31,200
noise.
- Yeah, wow.

5803
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:32,802
- Pretty loud.
- Wow.

5804
03:06:32,802 --> 03:06:34,110
- And one of the things you learn

5805
03:06:34,110 --> 03:06:35,970
is your brain gets used to whatever.

5806
03:06:35,969 --> 03:06:36,840
So I'm sure to techno,

5807
03:06:36,840 --> 03:06:38,940
if I actually give it a real chance.

5808
03:06:38,940 --> 03:06:39,773
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5809
03:06:39,772 --> 03:06:40,859
- My brain would get used to it.

5810
03:06:40,860 --> 03:06:42,750
But like with noise,

5811
03:06:42,750 --> 03:06:44,399
what happens is something
happens to your brain.

5812
03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:45,420
I think there's a science to it,

5813
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:46,770
but I don't really care.

5814
03:06:46,770 --> 03:06:49,140
You just have to be a scientist of one.

5815
03:06:49,139 --> 03:06:49,972
Study yourself,

5816
03:06:49,972 --> 03:06:50,806
your own brain.
Yeah.

5817
03:06:50,806 --> 03:06:53,433
- For me, it does something.

5818
03:06:54,329 --> 03:06:55,319
I discovered it right away

5819
03:06:55,319 --> 03:06:57,069
when I tried it for the first time.

5820
03:06:58,020 --> 03:06:59,823
After about like a couple minutes,

5821
03:07:02,180 --> 03:07:06,210
every distraction just like disappears.

5822
03:07:06,209 --> 03:07:08,216
And it goes like (imitates
pressure deflating)

5823
03:07:08,217 --> 03:07:13,215
You can like hold focus on
things like really well.

5824
03:07:13,215 --> 03:07:14,048
It's weird.

5825
03:07:14,048 --> 03:07:17,280
You can like really focus on a thing.

5826
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:18,810
It doesn't really matter what that is.

5827
03:07:18,809 --> 03:07:21,119
I think that's what people
achieve with like meditation.

5828
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:23,430
You can like focus on your breath,

5829
03:07:23,430 --> 03:07:24,403
for example, for so long.

5830
03:07:24,403 --> 03:07:25,236
- It's just normal brown noise.

5831
03:07:25,236 --> 03:07:26,739
It's not like binaural.

5832
03:07:26,738 --> 03:07:27,949
- No, it's just normal brown noise.

5833
03:07:27,950 --> 03:07:30,030
- It's like shhhh.
- Yeah.

5834
03:07:30,030 --> 03:07:31,710
- White noise, I think it's same.

5835
03:07:31,709 --> 03:07:33,422
It's like make noise, white noise.

5836
03:07:34,338 --> 03:07:36,700
Brown noise I think is
when it's like bassier.

5837
03:07:36,700 --> 03:07:38,040
- Yeah, it's more diffused.

5838
03:07:38,040 --> 03:07:38,873
More dampened.
- Yeah.

5839
03:07:38,872 --> 03:07:40,076
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dampened.

5840
03:07:40,076 --> 03:07:41,639
- Yeah, I can see that.
- No sharpness.

5841
03:07:41,639 --> 03:07:43,288
- Yeah, sharp brightness.
- Yeah, brightness.

5842
03:07:43,289 --> 03:07:44,316
- Yeah, I can see that.

5843
03:07:44,316 --> 03:07:45,650
And you use a headphones, right?

5844
03:07:45,650 --> 03:07:46,860
- Yeah, headphones.
- Yeah.

5845
03:07:46,860 --> 03:07:49,829
- I actually like, walk around in life

5846
03:07:49,829 --> 03:07:51,539
often with brown noise.
- Dude,

5847
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:52,710
that's like psycho batshit.

5848
03:07:52,709 --> 03:07:53,542
But it's cool.
(Lex laughs)

5849
03:07:53,542 --> 03:07:54,869
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5850
03:07:54,870 --> 03:07:56,139
When I murder people, it helps.

5851
03:07:56,138 --> 03:07:58,379
(Lex laughs)

5852
03:07:58,379 --> 03:08:00,059
It drowns out their screams.

5853
03:08:00,059 --> 03:08:02,488
- Jesus Christ.
- I'm sorry,

5854
03:08:02,488 --> 03:08:03,322
I said too much.

5855
03:08:03,322 --> 03:08:05,130
- Man, I'm gonna try brown noise.

5856
03:08:05,129 --> 03:08:06,615
- With a murder or for the coding?

5857
03:08:06,615 --> 03:08:07,449
Yeah.
- For the coating, yeah.

5858
03:08:07,449 --> 03:08:08,552
- Okay, good.

5859
03:08:08,552 --> 03:08:09,743
Try it, try it.

5860
03:08:09,743 --> 03:08:11,159
But you have to like,
with everything else,

5861
03:08:11,159 --> 03:08:13,179
you give it a real chance.
- Yeah.

5862
03:08:13,179 --> 03:08:15,210
- I also, like I said,

5863
03:08:15,209 --> 03:08:18,029
do techno type stuff.

5864
03:08:18,030 --> 03:08:20,882
Electronic music on
top of the brown noise,

5865
03:08:22,409 --> 03:08:24,989
but then control the speed,

5866
03:08:24,989 --> 03:08:26,940
'cause the faster it
goes, the more anxiety.

5867
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:29,220
So if I really need to get shit done,

5868
03:08:29,219 --> 03:08:31,409
especially with programming,
I'll have a beat.

5869
03:08:31,409 --> 03:08:32,610
- Yeah.
- And it's great.

5870
03:08:32,610 --> 03:08:33,458
It's cool.

5871
03:08:33,458 --> 03:08:34,640
Say is cool to play those little tricks

5872
03:08:34,639 --> 03:08:36,001
of your mind to study yourself.

5873
03:08:36,002 --> 03:08:37,140
- Yeah.

5874
03:08:37,139 --> 03:08:38,356
- I usually don't like
to have people around,

5875
03:08:38,356 --> 03:08:40,409
'cause when people,

5876
03:08:40,409 --> 03:08:42,122
even if they're working,

5877
03:08:42,122 --> 03:08:43,739
I don't know, I like people too much.

5878
03:08:43,739 --> 03:08:44,819
They're like, interesting.

5879
03:08:44,819 --> 03:08:46,020
- There might be, yeah.

5880
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:48,000
In coworker space, I would
just start talking too much.

5881
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,049
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

5882
03:08:49,049 --> 03:08:50,909
- So there's a source of distraction.

5883
03:08:50,909 --> 03:08:52,350
- Yeah, in the cowork space,

5884
03:08:52,350 --> 03:08:55,950
we would do like a money pot, like a mug.

5885
03:08:55,950 --> 03:08:57,990
So we'd work for 45 minutes

5886
03:08:57,989 --> 03:09:00,090
and then if you would
say, like pair of words,

5887
03:09:00,090 --> 03:09:01,559
you would get a fine, which is like $1.

5888
03:09:01,559 --> 03:09:03,819
So you'd put $1 to say, "Hey, what's up?"

5889
03:09:03,819 --> 03:09:06,813
So $3 you put in the mug,

5890
03:09:07,950 --> 03:09:09,810
and then 15 minutes free time.

5891
03:09:09,809 --> 03:09:10,643
We can like party, whatever.

5892
03:09:10,643 --> 03:09:12,959
And then 45 minutes again working.

5893
03:09:12,959 --> 03:09:13,792
And that works.

5894
03:09:13,792 --> 03:09:15,936
But you need to shut people
up or they, you know.

5895
03:09:15,936 --> 03:09:20,936
- I think there's an intimacy
in being silent together-

5896
03:09:21,899 --> 03:09:23,369
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5897
03:09:23,370 --> 03:09:25,113
- Maybe I'm uncomfortable with.

5898
03:09:27,774 --> 03:09:30,090
If you need to make yourself vulnerable

5899
03:09:30,090 --> 03:09:32,430
and actually do it,
like with close friends

5900
03:09:32,430 --> 03:09:33,809
to just sit there in silence

5901
03:09:33,809 --> 03:09:35,100
for long periods of time.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5902
03:09:35,100 --> 03:09:36,450
- And like doing a thing.

5903
03:09:36,450 --> 03:09:39,150
- Dude, I watched this
video of this podcast.

5904
03:09:39,149 --> 03:09:42,119
It was like this Buddhism
podcast with people meditating,

5905
03:09:42,120 --> 03:09:43,740
and they were interviewing
each other or whatever,

5906
03:09:43,739 --> 03:09:44,573
and like a podcast.

5907
03:09:44,573 --> 03:09:48,573
And suddenly after a question,
it's like, yeah, yeah.

5908
03:09:50,729 --> 03:09:53,219
And they were just silent
for like three minutes.

5909
03:09:53,219 --> 03:09:55,109
And then they said it was amazing.

5910
03:09:55,110 --> 03:09:56,190
Yeah, it was amazing.

5911
03:09:56,190 --> 03:09:58,319
I was like, wow, pretty cool.

5912
03:09:58,319 --> 03:09:59,372
- Elon is like that.

5913
03:10:00,510 --> 03:10:02,460
And I really like that,

5914
03:10:02,459 --> 03:10:03,572
he'll ask a question.

5915
03:10:04,649 --> 03:10:07,862
I don't know, what's a perfectly
productive day for you?

5916
03:10:07,862 --> 03:10:09,420
Like I just asked,

5917
03:10:09,420 --> 03:10:11,781
and you just sit there for
like 30 seconds thinking.

5918
03:10:11,781 --> 03:10:13,232
- Yeah, he thinks.

5919
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:16,253
- Yeah, I don't know.

5920
03:10:16,253 --> 03:10:17,086
- That's so cool.

5921
03:10:19,079 --> 03:10:21,180
I wish I could think more about,

5922
03:10:21,180 --> 03:10:23,850
but I wanna show you my heart.

5923
03:10:23,850 --> 03:10:24,683
I wanna show you...

5924
03:10:24,683 --> 03:10:25,530
go straight from my heart

5925
03:10:25,530 --> 03:10:27,480
to my mouth to like saying the real thing.

5926
03:10:27,479 --> 03:10:29,459
And the more I think the more I start

5927
03:10:29,459 --> 03:10:31,586
like filtering myself, right?

5928
03:10:31,586 --> 03:10:34,170
And I wanna just throw
it out there immediately.

5929
03:10:34,170 --> 03:10:35,430
- I do that more with team.

5930
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:36,989
I think he has a lot of practice in that.

5931
03:10:36,989 --> 03:10:37,823
I do that as well.

5932
03:10:37,823 --> 03:10:39,659
And in team setting, when you're thinking,

5933
03:10:39,659 --> 03:10:40,493
brainstorming.
- Yeah.

5934
03:10:40,493 --> 03:10:43,315
- And you allow yourself to
just like, think in silence.

5935
03:10:43,315 --> 03:10:44,987
- Yeah.
- Just like,

5936
03:10:44,986 --> 03:10:46,954
'cause even in meetings,
people wanna talk.

5937
03:10:46,954 --> 03:10:47,852
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5938
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:51,360
- It's like, no, you
think before you speak

5939
03:10:51,360 --> 03:10:53,100
and just like, it's okay
to be silent together.

5940
03:10:53,100 --> 03:10:53,940
- [Pieter] Yeah.

5941
03:10:53,940 --> 03:10:55,770
- And if you allow yourself
the room to do that,

5942
03:10:55,770 --> 03:10:57,387
you can actually come up
with really good ideas.

5943
03:10:57,387 --> 03:10:59,952
- Yeah.
- So, okay, this perfect day,

5944
03:10:59,951 --> 03:11:02,672
(laughs) how much caffeine
are you consuming in this day?

5945
03:11:02,673 --> 03:11:03,903
- Man, too much, right?

5946
03:11:04,826 --> 03:11:07,260
Because normally like two cups of coffee.

5947
03:11:07,260 --> 03:11:10,139
But on this perfect day,
we go to four maybe.

5948
03:11:10,139 --> 03:11:12,420
So we're starting to
hit the anxiety levels.

5949
03:11:12,420 --> 03:11:14,940
- So four cups is a lot for you?

5950
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:15,840
- Well, I think my coffees

5951
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:16,673
are quite strong when I make them.

5952
03:11:16,673 --> 03:11:20,550
It's like 20 grams of
coffee powder in the V60.

5953
03:11:20,549 --> 03:11:24,000
So my friends call 'em like nuclear coffee

5954
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,530
'cause it's quite heavy.
- Yeah, super strong.

5955
03:11:25,530 --> 03:11:27,300
- It's quite strong.

5956
03:11:27,299 --> 03:11:29,729
But it's nice to hit that anxiety level

5957
03:11:29,729 --> 03:11:31,770
where you're like almost panic attack.

5958
03:11:31,770 --> 03:11:32,700
- Yeah.
- But you're not there yet.

5959
03:11:32,700 --> 03:11:36,720
But that's like, man,
it's like super locked in.

5960
03:11:36,719 --> 03:11:39,119
Just like (imitates intense music)

5961
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:40,050
It's amazing.

5962
03:11:40,049 --> 03:11:43,202
But I mean there's a
space for that in my life.

5963
03:11:44,840 --> 03:11:46,229
But I think it's great
for making new stuff.

5964
03:11:46,229 --> 03:11:47,063
It's amazing.

5965
03:11:47,063 --> 03:11:48,629
- Starting from scratch,
creating a new thing.

5966
03:11:48,629 --> 03:11:51,179
- Yes, I think girlfriends
should let their guys

5967
03:11:51,180 --> 03:11:54,090
go away for like two weeks.

5968
03:11:54,090 --> 03:11:56,399
Every few, no, every year at least.

5969
03:11:56,399 --> 03:11:58,229
Maybe every quarter, I dunno.

5970
03:11:58,229 --> 03:12:02,520
And just sit and make some shit without,

5971
03:12:02,520 --> 03:12:04,590
they're amazing but like no disturbance.

5972
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:05,760
Just be alone.

5973
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:09,569
And then people can make
something very, very amazing.

5974
03:12:09,569 --> 03:12:11,819
- Just wearing cowboy hats in
the mountains like we showed.

5975
03:12:11,819 --> 03:12:12,779
- Exactly, we can do that.

5976
03:12:12,780 --> 03:12:14,430
- There's a movie about that.
- With the laptops.

5977
03:12:14,430 --> 03:12:15,960
- They didn't do much programming though.

5978
03:12:15,959 --> 03:12:17,242
- Yeah, you can do a little bit of that.

5979
03:12:17,243 --> 03:12:18,076
- Okay.

5980
03:12:18,075 --> 03:12:19,729
- And then a little bit of shipping.

5981
03:12:19,729 --> 03:12:20,629
You could do both.

5982
03:12:21,930 --> 03:12:22,950
- It's a different, "Brokeback Mountain."

5983
03:12:22,950 --> 03:12:23,972
- They need to allow us to go.

5984
03:12:23,972 --> 03:12:25,469
They need like a man cave, right?

5985
03:12:25,469 --> 03:12:26,579
- Yeah, to ship.

5986
03:12:26,579 --> 03:12:27,413
- Yeah, to ship.
(Lex laughs)

5987
03:12:27,413 --> 03:12:28,920
- Get shit done, yeah.

5988
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:31,110
It's a balance, okay, cool.

5989
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:32,846
What about sleep, naps and all that?

5990
03:12:32,846 --> 03:12:34,079
You not sleeping much?

5991
03:12:34,079 --> 03:12:35,760
- I don't do naps in the day.

5992
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:36,750
I think power naps are good,

5993
03:12:36,750 --> 03:12:39,063
but I'm never tired anymore in the day.

5994
03:12:40,319 --> 03:12:42,420
Man, also 'cause of gym, I'm not tired.

5995
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:44,069
I'm tired when I wanna...

5996
03:12:44,069 --> 03:12:45,569
When it's night, I need to sleep.

5997
03:12:45,569 --> 03:12:46,770
- Yeah, me, I love naps.
- I sleep very well.

5998
03:12:46,771 --> 03:12:47,694
- I love naps.

5999
03:12:47,693 --> 03:12:48,652
- Yeah.
- I don't care.

6000
03:12:48,652 --> 03:12:49,485
I don't know.

6001
03:12:49,485 --> 03:12:51,930
I don't know why, brain
shuts off, turns on.

6002
03:12:51,930 --> 03:12:52,909
I dunno if it's healthy or not.

6003
03:12:52,909 --> 03:12:55,020
It just works.
- Yeah.

6004
03:12:55,020 --> 03:12:56,640
- I think with anything mental, physical,

6005
03:12:56,639 --> 03:12:58,289
you have to be a student of your own body

6006
03:12:58,290 --> 03:12:59,430
and like-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6007
03:12:59,430 --> 03:13:01,020
- Know what the limits are.

6008
03:13:01,020 --> 03:13:02,550
You have to be skeptical taking advice

6009
03:13:02,549 --> 03:13:04,469
from the internet in general,

6010
03:13:04,469 --> 03:13:08,159
'cause a lot of the advice
is just like a good baseline

6011
03:13:08,159 --> 03:13:11,104
for the general population.
- It's not personalized, yeah.

6012
03:13:11,104 --> 03:13:12,332
- You have to become
a student of your own-

6013
03:13:12,333 --> 03:13:14,250
- Yeah.
- Like of your own body,

6014
03:13:14,250 --> 03:13:15,083
of your own self,

6015
03:13:15,083 --> 03:13:16,563
of how you work, yeah.

6016
03:13:17,686 --> 03:13:19,229
I've done a lot of and just like,

6017
03:13:19,229 --> 03:13:21,600
for me, fasting was an interesting one,

6018
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:24,090
because I used to eat
a bunch of meals a day,

6019
03:13:24,090 --> 03:13:25,559
especially when I was lifting heavy.

6020
03:13:25,559 --> 03:13:28,164
'Cause everybody says, "You have to eat,"

6021
03:13:28,165 --> 03:13:31,920
kind of a lot, multiple meals a day.

6022
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:34,860
But I realize I can get much stronger,

6023
03:13:34,860 --> 03:13:38,340
feel much better if I eat
once or twice a day on.

6024
03:13:38,340 --> 03:13:39,552
- Yeah, me too, yeah.
- It's crazy.

6025
03:13:39,552 --> 03:13:41,090
- I never understood this
small meal thing, yeah.

6026
03:13:41,090 --> 03:13:42,000
It didn't work for me.

6027
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:43,709
- Well, let me just ask you,

6028
03:13:43,709 --> 03:13:45,269
it'd interesting if you can comment

6029
03:13:45,270 --> 03:13:47,670
on some of the other
products you've created.

6030
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:49,590
We talked about Nomad List, Interior AI,

6031
03:13:49,590 --> 03:13:51,360
Photo AI, Therapist AI.

6032
03:13:51,360 --> 03:13:52,500
What's RemoteOK?

6033
03:13:52,500 --> 03:13:55,680
- It's a job board for remote jobs.

6034
03:13:55,680 --> 03:13:58,770
Because back then, like 10
years ago there was job boards,

6035
03:13:58,770 --> 03:14:01,770
but it was not really specifically
remote job, job boards.

6036
03:14:01,770 --> 03:14:03,479
So I made one...

6037
03:14:03,479 --> 03:14:05,069
First of all, Nomad List
is I made like nomad jobs,

6038
03:14:05,069 --> 03:14:06,029
like a page.

6039
03:14:06,030 --> 03:14:07,710
And a lot of companies started hiring

6040
03:14:07,709 --> 03:14:08,819
and they pay for job posts.

6041
03:14:08,819 --> 03:14:10,739
So I spin it off to RemoteOK.

6042
03:14:10,739 --> 03:14:12,569
And now it's like this number one

6043
03:14:12,569 --> 03:14:15,270
or number two biggest remote job boards.

6044
03:14:15,270 --> 03:14:17,460
And it's also fully automated

6045
03:14:17,459 --> 03:14:19,139
and people just post a
job and people apply.

6046
03:14:19,139 --> 03:14:21,059
It has like profiles as well.

6047
03:14:21,059 --> 03:14:23,489
It's kinda like LinkedIn for remotes work.

6048
03:14:23,489 --> 03:14:26,280
- So's focus on remote only.
- Yeah.

6049
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:27,898
It's essentially like a simple job board.

6050
03:14:27,897 --> 03:14:29,069
I discover job boards

6051
03:14:29,069 --> 03:14:31,069
are way more complicated than you think.

6052
03:14:32,430 --> 03:14:34,272
Yeah, it's a job board for remote jobs.

6053
03:14:34,272 --> 03:14:36,150
(Lex laughs)

6054
03:14:36,149 --> 03:14:37,049
But the nice thing is you can

6055
03:14:37,049 --> 03:14:38,340
charge a lot of money for job posts.

6056
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:39,239
Man, it's good money.

6057
03:14:39,239 --> 03:14:40,829
B2B, you can charge like,

6058
03:14:40,829 --> 03:14:42,389
you start with 299.

6059
03:14:42,389 --> 03:14:47,279
But at the peak when the Fed
started printing money, 2021.

6060
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:49,680
I was making like 140K
a month with RemoteOK,

6061
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:51,389
with just job posts.

6062
03:14:51,389 --> 03:14:53,129
And I started like adding crazy upsells,

6063
03:14:53,129 --> 03:14:54,119
like rainbow color,

6064
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:55,440
it's job posts.

6065
03:14:55,440 --> 03:14:56,407
You can add your background images.

6066
03:14:56,406 --> 03:14:57,869
- Yeah.
- It's just upsells man.

6067
03:14:57,870 --> 03:14:59,820
And you charge $1,000 for an upsell.

6068
03:14:59,819 --> 03:15:00,813
It was crazy.

6069
03:15:01,968 --> 03:15:03,259
And all these companies is up so up.

6070
03:15:03,260 --> 03:15:04,920
So yeah, we want everything.

6071
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:09,030
Job post would cost 3,000, $4,000.

6072
03:15:09,030 --> 03:15:11,489
And I was like, this is good business.

6073
03:15:11,489 --> 03:15:13,350
And then the Fed stopped printing money

6074
03:15:13,350 --> 03:15:14,808
and it all went down,

6075
03:15:14,808 --> 03:15:17,890
and it went down to like
10K a month from 140.

6076
03:15:17,889 --> 03:15:19,229
- Yeah.
- Now it's back.

6077
03:15:19,229 --> 03:15:20,146
I think it's like 40.

6078
03:15:20,147 --> 03:15:22,020
It was good times.

6079
03:15:22,020 --> 03:15:25,075
- I gotta ask you about back
to the digital nomad life.

6080
03:15:25,075 --> 03:15:25,908
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6081
03:15:25,907 --> 03:15:29,309
- You wrote a blog post on the reset.

6082
03:15:29,309 --> 03:15:31,709
And in general, just
giving away everything,

6083
03:15:31,709 --> 03:15:33,239
living a minimalist life.

6084
03:15:33,239 --> 03:15:36,209
- Yeah.
- What did it take to do that,

6085
03:15:36,209 --> 03:15:37,829
like to get rid of everything?

6086
03:15:37,829 --> 03:15:39,899
- 10 years ago was like
this trend in the blog.

6087
03:15:39,899 --> 03:15:41,129
Back then blogs were so popular.

6088
03:15:41,129 --> 03:15:42,149
It was a blogosphere,

6089
03:15:42,149 --> 03:15:43,859
and it was like 100 things challenge.

6090
03:15:43,860 --> 03:15:44,693
- What is that?

6091
03:15:44,692 --> 03:15:45,659
The 100 things challenge.
- I mean, it's ridiculous.

6092
03:15:45,659 --> 03:15:48,360
But like you write down every
object you have in your house

6093
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:50,370
and you count it, you make a spreadsheet

6094
03:15:50,370 --> 03:15:52,560
and you're like, "Okay,
I have 500 things."

6095
03:15:52,559 --> 03:15:53,681
You need to get it down to 100.

6096
03:15:53,682 --> 03:15:55,200
Why?

6097
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:57,090
This just the trend, so I did it.

6098
03:15:57,090 --> 03:15:59,219
I started like selling stuff,
started throwing away off.

6099
03:15:59,219 --> 03:16:04,219
And I did like MDMA and
ecstasy like 2012 kind of.

6100
03:16:06,213 --> 03:16:08,370
And after that trip, I felt so different,

6101
03:16:08,370 --> 03:16:10,686
and I felt like I had to
start throwing shit away.

6102
03:16:10,686 --> 03:16:12,420
I swear.
- Yeah.

6103
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:13,676
- And I started throwing shit away.

6104
03:16:13,676 --> 03:16:15,420
And I felt that was like,

6105
03:16:15,420 --> 03:16:18,270
it was almost the drug
sending me to a path of like,

6106
03:16:18,270 --> 03:16:19,200
you need to throw all your shit away.

6107
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:21,300
You need to start go on a journey.

6108
03:16:21,299 --> 03:16:22,739
You need to get out of here.

6109
03:16:22,739 --> 03:16:26,879
And that's what the
MDMA did, I think, yeah.

6110
03:16:26,879 --> 03:16:29,099
- How hard is it to get down to 100 items?

6111
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:31,140
- Boy, you need to like,
sell your PC and stuff.

6112
03:16:31,139 --> 03:16:32,609
You need to go on eBay

6113
03:16:32,610 --> 03:16:34,110
and then, man, going eBay,

6114
03:16:34,110 --> 03:16:34,943
selling all your stuff is balancing,

6115
03:16:34,942 --> 03:16:36,890
'cause you discover society.

6116
03:16:36,890 --> 03:16:38,670
You meet the craziest people.

6117
03:16:38,670 --> 03:16:41,879
You meet every range from rich to poor,

6118
03:16:41,879 --> 03:16:43,472
everybody comes to your
house to buy stuff.

6119
03:16:43,472 --> 03:16:44,819
It's so funny, so interesting.

6120
03:16:44,819 --> 03:16:46,199
I recommend everybody do this.

6121
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:48,090
- Just to meet people that want your shit.

6122
03:16:48,090 --> 03:16:50,760
- Yeah, it was so like, I didn't know,

6123
03:16:50,760 --> 03:16:51,593
I wasn't living in Amsterdam,

6124
03:16:51,593 --> 03:16:52,426
and I didn't know,

6125
03:16:52,425 --> 03:16:54,293
I have my own subculture or whatever.

6126
03:16:54,293 --> 03:16:55,432
And I discovered the Dutch people,

6127
03:16:55,433 --> 03:16:57,990
like as they are from eBay.

6128
03:16:57,989 --> 03:16:59,100
So I sold everything.

6129
03:16:59,100 --> 03:17:01,586
- What's the weirdest
thing you had to sell

6130
03:17:01,586 --> 03:17:03,329
and you had to find a buyer for,

6131
03:17:03,329 --> 03:17:05,789
not the weirdest, but
like, what's memorable?

6132
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:07,710
- So back then I was making music

6133
03:17:07,709 --> 03:17:08,879
and we would make music videos

6134
03:17:08,879 --> 03:17:10,679
with like a Canon 5D camera.
- Yeah.

6135
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:13,950
- Back then everybody's
making films and musicals.

6136
03:17:13,950 --> 03:17:16,113
And we bought it with
my friends and stuff.

6137
03:17:18,233 --> 03:17:19,996
And it was kind of like, I
had to sell this thing too,

6138
03:17:19,996 --> 03:17:21,750
'cause it was very expensive.

6139
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:23,100
It was like 6K or something.

6140
03:17:23,100 --> 03:17:24,360
- [Lex] Yeah.

6141
03:17:24,360 --> 03:17:25,590
- But it meant that selling this,

6142
03:17:25,590 --> 03:17:27,389
meant that we wouldn't
make music theater anymore.

6143
03:17:27,389 --> 03:17:28,739
I would leave Holland.

6144
03:17:28,739 --> 03:17:31,020
This kind of stuff we
were working on would end.

6145
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:33,290
And I was kind of saying
this music theater stuff,

6146
03:17:33,290 --> 03:17:35,093
we're not getting famous
in this or successful.

6147
03:17:35,093 --> 03:17:36,150
We need to stop doing this.

6148
03:17:36,149 --> 03:17:39,600
This music production also,
it's not really working.

6149
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:42,640
And it was kinda like, felt
very bad for my friends,

6150
03:17:42,639 --> 03:17:44,549
'cause we would work together on this

6151
03:17:44,549 --> 03:17:48,406
and to sell this camera
that we'd make stuff with.

6152
03:17:48,406 --> 03:17:50,279
- It was a hard goodbye.

6153
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:51,960
- It was just a camera, but it was like,

6154
03:17:51,959 --> 03:17:54,239
it felt like, sorry guys,

6155
03:17:54,239 --> 03:17:55,468
it doesn't work and I need to go.

6156
03:17:55,468 --> 03:17:57,093
- Who bought it?

6157
03:17:57,093 --> 03:17:58,603
Do you remember?

6158
03:17:58,603 --> 03:18:01,003
It was some guy who
couldn't possibly understand

6159
03:18:02,610 --> 03:18:04,140
the journey.
- The emotion of it.

6160
03:18:04,139 --> 03:18:05,149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

6161
03:18:05,149 --> 03:18:06,209
- He just showed up,

6162
03:18:06,209 --> 03:18:07,319
here's the money, thanks.

6163
03:18:07,319 --> 03:18:09,629
- Yeah, but it was like cutting your life.

6164
03:18:09,629 --> 03:18:11,849
This shit ends now and
now we gonna do new stuff.

6165
03:18:11,850 --> 03:18:13,290
- I think it's beautiful.

6166
03:18:13,290 --> 03:18:14,700
I did that twice in my life.

6167
03:18:14,700 --> 03:18:16,260
I give away everything,
everything, everything.

6168
03:18:16,260 --> 03:18:18,690
- Wow.
- Like down to just pants,

6169
03:18:18,690 --> 03:18:20,733
underwear, backpack.
- Yeah.

6170
03:18:22,950 --> 03:18:24,870
- I think it's important to do.

6171
03:18:24,870 --> 03:18:26,820
It shows you what's important.

6172
03:18:26,819 --> 03:18:28,287
- Yeah, I think that's
what I learned from it.

6173
03:18:28,287 --> 03:18:31,530
You learn that you can
live a very little objects

6174
03:18:31,530 --> 03:18:32,463
very little stuff,

6175
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:35,040
but there's a counter to it.

6176
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:38,070
You lean more on the stuff,
on the services, right?

6177
03:18:38,069 --> 03:18:39,180
Like for example, you don't need a car,

6178
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:40,280
you use Uber, right?

6179
03:18:40,280 --> 03:18:42,570
Or you don't need kitchen stuff

6180
03:18:42,569 --> 03:18:44,789
because you go to restaurants
when you're traveling.

6181
03:18:44,790 --> 03:18:46,890
So you lean more on
other people's services,

6182
03:18:46,889 --> 03:18:48,119
but spend money on that as well.

6183
03:18:48,120 --> 03:18:50,160
So that's good.
- Yeah, but just letting go

6184
03:18:50,159 --> 03:18:51,149
of material possessions,

6185
03:18:51,149 --> 03:18:53,340
which it gives a kind of freedom

6186
03:18:53,340 --> 03:18:54,989
to how you move about the world.

6187
03:18:54,989 --> 03:18:55,823
- Yeah.
- It gives you

6188
03:18:55,823 --> 03:18:57,132
complete freedom to go
into another city to-

6189
03:18:57,132 --> 03:18:58,500
- Yeah, with your backpack.

6190
03:18:58,500 --> 03:19:00,022
- The backpack.
- Yeah.

6191
03:19:00,022 --> 03:19:01,529
- There's a kind of freedom to it.

6192
03:19:01,530 --> 03:19:03,480
There's something about
material possessions

6193
03:19:03,479 --> 03:19:04,829
and having a place and all that,

6194
03:19:04,829 --> 03:19:06,299
that ties you down a little bit.

6195
03:19:06,299 --> 03:19:07,759
- Yeah.
- Like spiritually.

6196
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:09,600
- Yeah.
- It's good to take a leap

6197
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:10,500
alternate into the world.

6198
03:19:10,500 --> 03:19:11,834
Especially when you're younger to like.

6199
03:19:11,834 --> 03:19:12,667
- Man, I recommend if you're 18,

6200
03:19:12,666 --> 03:19:14,250
you get out of high school,

6201
03:19:14,250 --> 03:19:15,782
do this, go travel,

6202
03:19:17,289 --> 03:19:18,960
and build some internet stuff, whatever.

6203
03:19:18,959 --> 03:19:19,893
Bring your laptop.

6204
03:19:20,729 --> 03:19:22,859
It's amazing experience.

6205
03:19:22,860 --> 03:19:23,967
Five years ago, it's
still good in university,

6206
03:19:23,967 --> 03:19:25,230
but now I'm thinking like,

6207
03:19:25,229 --> 03:19:27,029
no, maybe skip university.

6208
03:19:27,030 --> 03:19:29,100
Just go first, like travel
around a little bit,

6209
03:19:29,100 --> 03:19:30,450
figure some stuff out.

6210
03:19:30,450 --> 03:19:32,430
You can go back to
university when you're 25.

6211
03:19:32,430 --> 03:19:34,156
You can like, okay, now I learned,

6212
03:19:34,156 --> 03:19:36,210
I'd be successful in business.

6213
03:19:36,209 --> 03:19:37,049
You have money at least.

6214
03:19:37,049 --> 03:19:39,195
Now you can choose what
you really wanna study.

6215
03:19:39,195 --> 03:19:40,530
Because people at 18,

6216
03:19:40,530 --> 03:19:42,060
they go study what's probably good

6217
03:19:42,059 --> 03:19:43,709
for the job market, right?

6218
03:19:43,709 --> 03:19:45,539
So it probably makes more sense.

6219
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:46,800
If you want that, go travel,

6220
03:19:46,799 --> 03:19:48,209
build some businesses,

6221
03:19:48,209 --> 03:19:49,500
and go back to university if you want.

6222
03:19:49,500 --> 03:19:51,180
- So one of the biggest uses

6223
03:19:51,180 --> 03:19:52,532
of a university is the networking.

6224
03:19:52,531 --> 03:19:56,549
You gain friends, you
gain, like you meet people.

6225
03:19:56,549 --> 03:19:57,672
It's a forcing function to meet people.

6226
03:19:57,673 --> 03:19:59,360
But if you can meet people out

6227
03:19:59,360 --> 03:20:00,440
to the world-
- Travel.

6228
03:20:00,440 --> 03:20:01,273
- By travel.

6229
03:20:01,272 --> 03:20:02,729
- Man, and you meet so
many different cultures.

6230
03:20:02,729 --> 03:20:05,699
- I mean, the problem for
me is like if I traveled

6231
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:07,230
at that young age, I'm attracted

6232
03:20:07,229 --> 03:20:09,302
to people at the outskirts of the world.

6233
03:20:09,302 --> 03:20:11,879
Like for me-
- Like where?

6234
03:20:11,879 --> 03:20:14,729
- Not geographically.
- Oh, like the subcultures.

6235
03:20:14,729 --> 03:20:16,770
- Yeah, like the weirdos,

6236
03:20:16,770 --> 03:20:17,790
the darkness.
- Yeah.

6237
03:20:17,790 --> 03:20:18,900
Yeah, me too.

6238
03:20:18,899 --> 03:20:21,594
- But that might not be the
best networking at 18 years old.

6239
03:20:21,594 --> 03:20:22,769
(Lex and Pieter laughs)

6240
03:20:22,770 --> 03:20:25,110
- No, man, if you're smart about it,

6241
03:20:25,110 --> 03:20:26,010
you can stay safe.

6242
03:20:26,010 --> 03:20:28,397
And I met so many weirdos from traveling.

6243
03:20:28,397 --> 03:20:29,850
That's how travel works.

6244
03:20:29,850 --> 03:20:31,768
If you really let loose, you
meet the craziest people.

6245
03:20:31,768 --> 03:20:32,601
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6246
03:20:32,601 --> 03:20:34,380
- And it's the most interesting people.

6247
03:20:37,483 --> 03:20:39,180
And I cannot recommend it enough.

6248
03:20:39,180 --> 03:20:41,760
- Well see, the other thing
is that when you're 18,

6249
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:44,880
I feel like depending on your personality,

6250
03:20:44,879 --> 03:20:47,819
you have to learn both how to be a weirdo

6251
03:20:47,819 --> 03:20:49,172
and how to be a normie.

6252
03:20:50,190 --> 03:20:52,493
You still have to learn
how to fit into society.

6253
03:20:52,493 --> 03:20:53,326
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6254
03:20:53,325 --> 03:20:54,629
- For a person like me, for example,

6255
03:20:54,629 --> 03:20:55,799
who's always an outcast.

6256
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:59,489
There's always a danger
for going full outcast.

6257
03:20:59,489 --> 03:21:00,323
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6258
03:21:00,323 --> 03:21:02,250
- And that's a harder life if you,

6259
03:21:02,250 --> 03:21:06,329
if you go to like, go full
artists in full like darkness,

6260
03:21:06,329 --> 03:21:08,159
it's just a harder life.
- You can come back,

6261
03:21:08,159 --> 03:21:08,993
you can come back to normie.

6262
03:21:08,993 --> 03:21:10,409
- That's a skill.

6263
03:21:10,409 --> 03:21:11,799
I think you have to learn-
- You think?

6264
03:21:11,799 --> 03:21:16,799
- How to fit in to polite society.

6265
03:21:16,829 --> 03:21:18,659
- But I was very strange outcast as well.

6266
03:21:18,659 --> 03:21:21,569
And I'm more adaptable to normie now.

6267
03:21:21,569 --> 03:21:23,129
- You learned it, yeah, learned it.

6268
03:21:23,129 --> 03:21:25,199
- After 30s, you're like, yeah.

6269
03:21:25,200 --> 03:21:27,270
- But you need a skill, you have to learn.

6270
03:21:27,270 --> 03:21:28,470
- Yeah.

6271
03:21:28,469 --> 03:21:29,569
Man, I feel also that,

6272
03:21:30,780 --> 03:21:31,680
you start as an outcast,

6273
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:33,389
but the more you work on yourself,

6274
03:21:33,389 --> 03:21:35,099
the less like shit you have.

6275
03:21:35,100 --> 03:21:36,600
You kind of start becoming more normie,

6276
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:39,600
because you become more chill
with yourself and more happy.

6277
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:41,983
And it kind of makes you
uninteresting, right?

6278
03:21:41,983 --> 03:21:42,816
- Yes.
- A little bit.

6279
03:21:42,816 --> 03:21:44,880
- Yes, yes.

6280
03:21:44,879 --> 03:21:47,429
- The crazy people are
always the most interesting.

6281
03:21:47,430 --> 03:21:49,380
If you've solved your internal struggles

6282
03:21:49,379 --> 03:21:51,056
and you therapy and stuff

6283
03:21:51,057 --> 03:21:53,159
and you kind of become kind of,

6284
03:21:53,159 --> 03:21:56,700
you know, it's not so
interesting anymore maybe.

6285
03:21:56,700 --> 03:21:58,380
- You don't have to be
broken to be interesting,

6286
03:21:58,379 --> 03:21:59,339
I guess is what I'm saying.

6287
03:21:59,340 --> 03:22:00,299
- Yeah.

6288
03:22:00,299 --> 03:22:03,659
- What kind of things were
left when you minimalized?

6289
03:22:03,659 --> 03:22:05,393
- So the backpack.
- Yeah.

6290
03:22:05,393 --> 03:22:08,489
- MacBook, toothbrush,

6291
03:22:08,489 --> 03:22:09,852
some clothes, underwear, socks.

6292
03:22:09,852 --> 03:22:11,156
- [Lex] Yeah.

6293
03:22:11,156 --> 03:22:12,809
- You don't need a lot of clothes in Asia

6294
03:22:12,809 --> 03:22:13,643
'cause it's hot.

6295
03:22:13,643 --> 03:22:16,290
So you just wear swim pants, swim shorts.

6296
03:22:16,290 --> 03:22:18,090
You walk around flip flops.

6297
03:22:18,090 --> 03:22:20,760
So very basic, T-shirt,

6298
03:22:20,760 --> 03:22:23,729
and go to the laundromat
and wash my stuff.

6299
03:22:23,729 --> 03:22:27,510
And I think it was like 50
things or something, yeah.

6300
03:22:27,510 --> 03:22:28,800
- Yeah, it's nice.

6301
03:22:28,799 --> 03:22:32,369
As I mentioned to you,
there's the show alone.

6302
03:22:32,370 --> 03:22:33,203
- Yeah.
- They really test you,

6303
03:22:33,202 --> 03:22:35,489
'cause, oh, you only get 10 items,

6304
03:22:35,489 --> 03:22:37,770
and you have to survive
out in the wilderness.

6305
03:22:37,770 --> 03:22:40,233
And then ax, like everybody brings an ax.

6306
03:22:41,280 --> 03:22:42,113
Some people

6307
03:22:43,469 --> 03:22:44,672
also have a saw.

6308
03:22:45,510 --> 03:22:46,343
- Wow.

6309
03:22:46,343 --> 03:22:47,880
- But usually ax does the job.

6310
03:22:47,879 --> 03:22:48,712
You basically have to,

6311
03:22:48,712 --> 03:22:49,799
in order to build a shelter,

6312
03:22:49,799 --> 03:22:52,319
you have to cut down and
to cut the trees and make,

6313
03:22:52,319 --> 03:22:53,770
and like-
- Learn Minecraft.

6314
03:22:54,941 --> 03:22:56,316
- Everything I learned about life,

6315
03:22:56,316 --> 03:22:58,949
(Pieter laughs)
I learn Minecraft, bro.

6316
03:22:58,950 --> 03:23:00,920
Yeah, yeah, you could.

6317
03:23:00,920 --> 03:23:03,629
It's nice to create those constraints

6318
03:23:03,629 --> 03:23:05,670
for yourself to understand
what matters to you

6319
03:23:05,670 --> 03:23:07,920
and also how to be in this world.

6320
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:09,770
And one of the ways to do that

6321
03:23:09,770 --> 03:23:11,733
is just to live a minimalist life.

6322
03:23:12,891 --> 03:23:13,725
But some people,

6323
03:23:13,725 --> 03:23:16,350
I've met people that really
enjoy material possessions

6324
03:23:16,350 --> 03:23:17,430
and that brings some happiness,

6325
03:23:17,430 --> 03:23:19,170
and that's a beautiful thing.
- Yeah.

6326
03:23:19,170 --> 03:23:20,350
- For me, it doesn't,

6327
03:23:21,777 --> 03:23:23,010
but people are different.

6328
03:23:23,010 --> 03:23:24,476
- It gives me happiness
for like two weeks.

6329
03:23:24,476 --> 03:23:25,309
- [Lex] Yeah.

6330
03:23:25,308 --> 03:23:27,921
- I'm very quickly adapting
to like a baseline.

6331
03:23:27,922 --> 03:23:30,960
Hedonistic adaptation very fast.

6332
03:23:30,959 --> 03:23:32,159
- Yeah.
- But man,

6333
03:23:32,159 --> 03:23:33,299
if you look at the studies,

6334
03:23:33,299 --> 03:23:37,289
most people like get a new car six months,

6335
03:23:37,290 --> 03:23:38,280
get a new house six months,

6336
03:23:38,280 --> 03:23:39,600
you just feel the same.

6337
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:41,850
She's like, wow, should
I buy all this stuff?

6338
03:23:42,809 --> 03:23:44,129
Studying hedonistic adaptation

6339
03:23:44,129 --> 03:23:45,989
made me think a lot about minimalism.

6340
03:23:45,989 --> 03:23:47,579
- And so that you don't even need to go

6341
03:23:47,579 --> 03:23:49,206
through the whole journey of getting it.

6342
03:23:49,206 --> 03:23:53,917
Just focus on the thing
that's more permanent.

6343
03:23:53,917 --> 03:23:55,918
- Yeah.
- Like building shit.

6344
03:23:55,918 --> 03:23:58,200
- Yeah, like people around
you, like people you love.

6345
03:23:58,200 --> 03:24:00,300
Nice food, nice experiences.
- Yeah.

6346
03:24:00,299 --> 03:24:02,579
- Meaningful work, those things.

6347
03:24:02,579 --> 03:24:05,340
Exercise, those things
make you happy, I think.

6348
03:24:05,340 --> 03:24:07,319
Make me happy for sure.

6349
03:24:07,319 --> 03:24:08,467
- You wrote a blog post,

6350
03:24:08,467 --> 03:24:11,310
"Why I'm unreachable and
maybe you should be too."

6351
03:24:11,309 --> 03:24:14,549
What's your strategy on
communicating with people?

6352
03:24:14,549 --> 03:24:17,019
- Yeah, so when I wrote that,
I was getting so many DMs

6353
03:24:17,020 --> 03:24:17,853
(Lex laughs)

6354
03:24:17,852 --> 03:24:20,896
as you probably have, you
have a million times more,

6355
03:24:20,897 --> 03:24:21,840
and people were getting angry

6356
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:23,737
that I wasn't responding and I was like,

6357
03:24:23,736 --> 03:24:26,519
"Okay, I'll just close
down these DMs completely.

6358
03:24:26,520 --> 03:24:28,290
And people got angry that
I closed my DMs down,

6359
03:24:28,290 --> 03:24:30,033
that I'm not like man of the people.

6360
03:24:30,032 --> 03:24:32,639
- It's like you changed man.
- Yeah, you've changed.

6361
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:34,448
You got, you know, like this.

6362
03:24:34,449 --> 03:24:36,420
And I'm like, I'll explain why.

6363
03:24:36,420 --> 03:24:38,309
I just don't have the time in a day

6364
03:24:38,309 --> 03:24:41,670
to answer every question.

6365
03:24:41,670 --> 03:24:44,549
And also people send you
like crazy shit, man.

6366
03:24:44,549 --> 03:24:45,929
Stalkers and like,

6367
03:24:45,930 --> 03:24:48,149
people write their
whole life story for you

6368
03:24:48,149 --> 03:24:49,170
and then ask you advice.

6369
03:24:49,170 --> 03:24:50,003
Man, I have no idea.

6370
03:24:50,003 --> 03:24:50,836
I'm not a therapist.

6371
03:24:50,835 --> 03:24:52,559
I don't know, I don't know this stuff.

6372
03:24:52,559 --> 03:24:54,449
- But also beautiful stuff.

6373
03:24:54,450 --> 03:24:56,685
- Absolutely, sure.
- Life story.

6374
03:24:56,684 --> 03:24:58,529
I've posted a coffee forum,

6375
03:24:58,530 --> 03:24:59,699
if you wanted to have a coffee with me.

6376
03:24:59,699 --> 03:25:01,440
- Nice.
- And I've gotten

6377
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:03,569
an extremely large number of submissions

6378
03:25:03,569 --> 03:25:05,459
and when I look at them,

6379
03:25:05,459 --> 03:25:07,021
there's just like
beautiful people in there.

6380
03:25:07,022 --> 03:25:08,210
- Yeah, stories.
- Beautiful human beings.

6381
03:25:08,209 --> 03:25:09,042
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6382
03:25:09,042 --> 03:25:10,350
- There's really powerful stories

6383
03:25:10,350 --> 03:25:11,970
and breaks my heart that I won't get

6384
03:25:11,969 --> 03:25:13,653
to meet those people.
- Yeah.

6385
03:25:14,549 --> 03:25:16,439
- And so this part of it is just like,

6386
03:25:16,440 --> 03:25:20,040
there's only so much bandwidth
to truly see other humans

6387
03:25:20,040 --> 03:25:22,170
and help them or understand them

6388
03:25:22,170 --> 03:25:24,750
or hear them or yeah, see them.

6389
03:25:24,750 --> 03:25:27,149
- Yeah, I have this problem that I try...

6390
03:25:27,149 --> 03:25:28,346
I wanna try help people

6391
03:25:28,346 --> 03:25:29,489
and also like, oh-
- Yeah.

6392
03:25:29,489 --> 03:25:31,239
- Let's make startups and whatever.

6393
03:25:32,441 --> 03:25:36,360
And I've learned over the
years that generally for me,

6394
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:37,530
and it sounds maybe bad, right?

6395
03:25:37,530 --> 03:25:39,329
But I helped my friend Andre, for example,

6396
03:25:39,329 --> 03:25:40,829
he came up to me in a cowork space.

6397
03:25:40,829 --> 03:25:41,663
That's how I met him.

6398
03:25:41,663 --> 03:25:42,496
And he said, "I wanna learn to code.

6399
03:25:42,495 --> 03:25:43,328
I wanna do startups, how do I do it?"

6400
03:25:43,328 --> 03:25:46,319
I said, "Okay, let's go install Nginx.

6401
03:25:46,319 --> 03:25:47,489
Let's start coding."

6402
03:25:47,489 --> 03:25:51,409
And he has this self-energy
that he actually...

6403
03:25:52,829 --> 03:25:54,569
He doesn't need to be pushed,

6404
03:25:54,569 --> 03:25:56,367
he just goes and he just
goes and he ask questions

6405
03:25:56,367 --> 03:25:57,960
and he doesn't ask too many questions.

6406
03:25:57,959 --> 03:25:59,339
He just goes, goes and learns it.

6407
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:01,409
And now he has a company
and makes a lot of money,

6408
03:26:01,409 --> 03:26:02,522
has his own startups.

6409
03:26:03,443 --> 03:26:05,760
And the people that I had to kind of like,

6410
03:26:05,760 --> 03:26:08,280
that ask me for help, but then I gave help

6411
03:26:08,280 --> 03:26:10,029
and then they started debating it.

6412
03:26:10,029 --> 03:26:11,819
- Yeah.
- Do you have that?

6413
03:26:11,819 --> 03:26:13,537
People ask you advice and
they go against you say,

6414
03:26:13,537 --> 03:26:15,027
"No, you're wrong, because."

6415
03:26:15,027 --> 03:26:16,710
I'm like, "Okay, bro,
I don't wanna debate.

6416
03:26:16,709 --> 03:26:18,329
You asked me for advice," right?

6417
03:26:18,329 --> 03:26:21,959
And the people need to push generally,

6418
03:26:21,959 --> 03:26:22,895
it doesn't happen.

6419
03:26:22,896 --> 03:26:23,729
- Yeah.
- You need to have

6420
03:26:23,728 --> 03:26:24,989
this energy for yourself.

6421
03:26:24,989 --> 03:26:25,860
- Well, they're searching.

6422
03:26:25,860 --> 03:26:27,450
They're searching, they're
trying to figure it out.

6423
03:26:27,450 --> 03:26:29,523
But oftentimes their search,

6424
03:26:30,840 --> 03:26:33,000
if they successfully find
what they're looking for,

6425
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:34,020
it'll be within.

6426
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:35,983
It sounds very like spiritual boost.

6427
03:26:35,983 --> 03:26:36,816
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6428
03:26:36,816 --> 03:26:38,457
- But it's really like figuring
that shit out on your own.

6429
03:26:38,457 --> 03:26:39,659
- Yeah.
- But they're reaching,

6430
03:26:39,659 --> 03:26:42,722
they're trying to ask
the world around them.

6431
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:45,000
How do I live this life?

6432
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:46,020
How do I figure this out?

6433
03:26:46,020 --> 03:26:47,579
But ultimately, the answer is gonna be

6434
03:26:47,579 --> 03:26:49,527
from them working on themselves.

6435
03:26:49,527 --> 03:26:51,989
And literally, it's the stupid thing,

6436
03:26:51,989 --> 03:26:53,949
but Googling and doing like searching-

6437
03:26:53,950 --> 03:26:55,680
- Yeah, surfing is procrastination.

6438
03:26:55,680 --> 03:26:56,971
I think sending messages to people.

6439
03:26:56,971 --> 03:26:58,770
- Yeah.
- Is a lot of procrastination.

6440
03:26:58,770 --> 03:27:00,220
Lex, how do you become
successful podcaster?

6441
03:27:00,220 --> 03:27:03,539
- Yeah.
- Bro, just start.

6442
03:27:03,540 --> 03:27:04,683
Just go.
- Yeah.

6443
03:27:06,010 --> 03:27:07,290
And just go.

6444
03:27:07,290 --> 03:27:09,990
- I would never ask you how
to be successful podcaster?

6445
03:27:09,989 --> 03:27:11,129
I would just start it,

6446
03:27:11,129 --> 03:27:13,079
and then I would copy your methods.

6447
03:27:13,079 --> 03:27:14,670
I would say, "Ah, this
guy's a Black background.

6448
03:27:14,670 --> 03:27:15,989
We probably need this as well."

6449
03:27:15,989 --> 03:27:17,010
- Yeah, try it.
- Yeah.

6450
03:27:17,010 --> 03:27:17,843
- Yeah, try.

6451
03:27:17,843 --> 03:27:20,100
And then you realize it's not
about the Black background,

6452
03:27:20,100 --> 03:27:20,933
it's about something else.

6453
03:27:20,933 --> 03:27:21,903
So you find your own voice,

6454
03:27:21,903 --> 03:27:23,430
just keep trying stuff.
- Exactly.

6455
03:27:23,430 --> 03:27:24,263
- Meditation is a difficult thing.

6456
03:27:24,263 --> 03:27:27,990
Like a lot of people copy
and they don't move past it.

6457
03:27:27,989 --> 03:27:29,489
- Yeah.
- You should understand

6458
03:27:29,489 --> 03:27:30,549
their methods and then move past it.

6459
03:27:30,549 --> 03:27:31,709
- Yeah.
- Find yourself,

6460
03:27:31,709 --> 03:27:32,542
find your own voice.

6461
03:27:32,542 --> 03:27:33,376
Find your own.
- Yeah, you imitate

6462
03:27:33,376 --> 03:27:35,040
and then you put your own spin to it,

6463
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:36,450
and that's like creative process.

6464
03:27:36,450 --> 03:27:38,010
That's literally the whole create...

6465
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:39,899
Everybody always builds
on the previous work.

6466
03:27:39,899 --> 03:27:41,086
- Yeah.
- You shouldn't get stuck.

6467
03:27:41,086 --> 03:27:44,010
- [Lex] 24 hours in a
day, eight hours of sleep.

6468
03:27:44,010 --> 03:27:46,649
You break it down into a math equation.

6469
03:27:46,649 --> 03:27:48,993
90 minutes of showering, clean up, coffee.

6470
03:27:50,114 --> 03:27:52,079
It just keeps whittling down to zero.

6471
03:27:52,079 --> 03:27:52,913
- Man, it's not this specific,

6472
03:27:52,913 --> 03:27:55,440
but I had to make like
an average or something.

6473
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:56,273
- Yeah.

6474
03:27:56,272 --> 03:27:58,229
Firefighting (laughs) oh, I like that.

6475
03:27:58,229 --> 03:28:00,659
One hours of groceries and errands.

6476
03:28:00,659 --> 03:28:02,610
I've tried breaking down minute by minute,

6477
03:28:02,610 --> 03:28:04,260
what I do in a day.
- Yeah.

6478
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:06,270
- Especially when my life was simpler.

6479
03:28:06,270 --> 03:28:07,770
It's really refreshing to understand

6480
03:28:07,770 --> 03:28:08,844
where you waste a lot of time.

6481
03:28:08,843 --> 03:28:12,572
- Yeah.
- And what you enjoy doing.

6482
03:28:13,860 --> 03:28:15,659
How many minutes it takes
to be happy? (laughs)

6483
03:28:15,659 --> 03:28:17,129
- Yeah.
- Doing the thing

6484
03:28:17,129 --> 03:28:18,179
that makes you happy

6485
03:28:18,180 --> 03:28:19,829
and how many minutes it
takes to be productive?

6486
03:28:19,829 --> 03:28:21,000
And you realize there's a lot of hours

6487
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:21,833
in the day-
- Yeah.

6488
03:28:21,833 --> 03:28:23,280
- If you spend it right.

6489
03:28:23,280 --> 03:28:24,113
- Yeah, a lot of it's wasted, yeah.

6490
03:28:24,112 --> 03:28:27,155
- For me, it's been the biggest battle

6491
03:28:27,156 --> 03:28:30,330
for the longest time is
finding stretches of time

6492
03:28:30,329 --> 03:28:33,750
where I can deeply focus into
really, really deep work.

6493
03:28:33,750 --> 03:28:36,959
Just like zoom in and completely focused,

6494
03:28:36,959 --> 03:28:38,467
cutting away all the distractions.

6495
03:28:38,468 --> 03:28:40,708
- Yeah, me too.
- That's the battle.

6496
03:28:40,708 --> 03:28:42,210
- Yeah.
- It's unpleasant.

6497
03:28:42,209 --> 03:28:43,799
It's extremely unpleasant.

6498
03:28:43,799 --> 03:28:45,149
- We need to fly to an island,

6499
03:28:45,149 --> 03:28:47,670
make a man cave island where we can just,

6500
03:28:47,670 --> 03:28:49,920
everybody can just code for a week,

6501
03:28:49,920 --> 03:28:51,690
and just get shit done.

6502
03:28:51,690 --> 03:28:54,690
Make new projects.
- Yeah, yeah.

6503
03:28:54,690 --> 03:28:55,756
- But man, they called
me psychopaths for this,

6504
03:28:55,756 --> 03:28:58,292
'cause it says like one
hours of sex, hugs, love.

6505
03:28:59,250 --> 03:29:00,315
Man, I had to write something,

6506
03:29:00,315 --> 03:29:02,790
and they were like, "Oh,
this guy's psychopath."

6507
03:29:02,790 --> 03:29:05,130
He plans his sex in specific hour-

6508
03:29:05,129 --> 03:29:06,474
- Like hugs.
- Bro, I don't.

6509
03:29:06,475 --> 03:29:09,262
- A counter for hugs.
- Yeah, exactly.

6510
03:29:09,262 --> 03:29:11,909
Yeah, like click, click, click.

6511
03:29:11,909 --> 03:29:15,051
- It's just a numerical
representation of what life is.

6512
03:29:15,051 --> 03:29:18,389
- Yeah.
- It's like one of those,

6513
03:29:18,389 --> 03:29:21,420
when you draw out how many
weeks you have in a life.

6514
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:22,799
- Oh, dude, this is like dark.

6515
03:29:22,799 --> 03:29:24,421
Yeah, man, don't wanna
look at that too much.

6516
03:29:24,422 --> 03:29:25,381
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, man.

6517
03:29:25,380 --> 03:29:26,213
(Lex laughs)

6518
03:29:26,213 --> 03:29:27,389
How many times you see your parents?

6519
03:29:27,389 --> 03:29:28,222
Jesus, man.
- Yeah.

6520
03:29:28,222 --> 03:29:30,479
- It's scary, man.
- That's right.

6521
03:29:30,479 --> 03:29:32,647
It might be only a handful more times.

6522
03:29:32,647 --> 03:29:33,509
- [Pieter] Yeah, man.

6523
03:29:33,510 --> 03:29:34,430
- You just look at the math of it.

6524
03:29:34,430 --> 03:29:36,159
If you see him once a
year or twice a year.

6525
03:29:36,159 --> 03:29:38,136
- Yeah, FaceTime today.
- Yeah.

6526
03:29:38,136 --> 03:29:38,969
- Yeah.

6527
03:29:40,440 --> 03:29:45,300
- I mean, that's like
dark when you see somebody

6528
03:29:45,299 --> 03:29:48,029
you like seeing, like a friend

6529
03:29:48,030 --> 03:29:50,400
that's on the outskirts
of your friend group.

6530
03:29:50,399 --> 03:29:51,489
And then you realize like,

6531
03:29:51,489 --> 03:29:56,159
well, I haven't really seen
him for like three years.

6532
03:29:56,159 --> 03:29:57,909
So how many more times do we have-

6533
03:29:57,909 --> 03:29:59,940
- Yeah.
- That we see each other?

6534
03:29:59,940 --> 03:30:00,773
- Do you believe that like,

6535
03:30:00,772 --> 03:30:03,512
friends just slowly
disappear from your life?

6536
03:30:05,280 --> 03:30:06,810
Your friend group evolves, right?

6537
03:30:06,809 --> 03:30:08,909
- [Lex] So it does, it does.

6538
03:30:08,909 --> 03:30:09,780
- There's a problem with Facebook,

6539
03:30:09,780 --> 03:30:11,670
you get all these old friends from school,

6540
03:30:11,670 --> 03:30:12,756
when you were 10 years old.
- Yeah.

6541
03:30:12,756 --> 03:30:14,432
- Back when Facebook started.

6542
03:30:15,701 --> 03:30:16,590
You would add friend them

6543
03:30:16,590 --> 03:30:18,180
and then you're like, why
are we in touch again?

6544
03:30:18,180 --> 03:30:20,040
Just keep the memories there.

6545
03:30:20,040 --> 03:30:21,690
It's different life now.

6546
03:30:21,690 --> 03:30:25,500
- Yeah, that might be a
guy thing or I don't know.

6547
03:30:25,500 --> 03:30:27,899
There's certain friends I have that like,

6548
03:30:27,899 --> 03:30:30,270
we don't interact often,
but we're still friends.

6549
03:30:30,270 --> 03:30:33,399
- Yeah.
- Every time I see him

6550
03:30:34,649 --> 03:30:36,119
I think it's because we have a foundation

6551
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:37,800
of many shared experiences.

6552
03:30:37,799 --> 03:30:39,149
- Yeah.
- And many memories.

6553
03:30:39,149 --> 03:30:41,222
I guess it's like nothing has changed.

6554
03:30:42,059 --> 03:30:43,073
Almost like, we've been talking every day,

6555
03:30:43,073 --> 03:30:44,817
even if we haven't talked for a year.

6556
03:30:44,816 --> 03:30:47,399
- Yeah, yeah, that's deep.

6557
03:30:47,399 --> 03:30:48,539
- Yeah.
- Issues.

6558
03:30:48,540 --> 03:30:50,850
- So I don't have to be
interacting with them

6559
03:30:50,850 --> 03:30:52,110
for them to be in a friend group.

6560
03:30:52,110 --> 03:30:55,110
And then there's some people
I interact with a lot.

6561
03:30:55,110 --> 03:30:58,230
So it depends, but
there's just this network

6562
03:30:58,229 --> 03:31:00,869
of good human beings that I can.

6563
03:31:00,870 --> 03:31:02,400
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6564
03:31:02,399 --> 03:31:03,869
- Yeah, they have like
a real love for them.

6565
03:31:03,870 --> 03:31:06,870
And I can always count on them,

6566
03:31:06,870 --> 03:31:10,200
if any of them called me
in the middle of the night,

6567
03:31:10,200 --> 03:31:13,296
I'll get rid of a body, I'm there.

6568
03:31:13,296 --> 03:31:17,460
I like how that's a different
definition of friendship,

6569
03:31:17,459 --> 03:31:20,159
but it's true, it's true.
- True friend.

6570
03:31:20,159 --> 03:31:22,559
- You've become more and
more famous recently.

6571
03:31:22,559 --> 03:31:24,479
How's that affect you?

6572
03:31:24,479 --> 03:31:26,471
- It's not recently because
it's this gradual thing, right?

6573
03:31:26,471 --> 03:31:28,920
It keeps going,

6574
03:31:28,920 --> 03:31:32,850
and I also don't know
why it's keeps going.

6575
03:31:32,850 --> 03:31:35,190
- Does that put pressure on you to,

6576
03:31:35,190 --> 03:31:36,780
'cause you're pretty open on Twitter

6577
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:39,585
and you're just like basically
building shit in the open.

6578
03:31:39,584 --> 03:31:40,829
- Yeah.

6579
03:31:40,829 --> 03:31:44,489
- And just not really caring
if it's too technical,

6580
03:31:44,489 --> 03:31:46,889
if it's any of this just being out there,

6581
03:31:46,889 --> 03:31:47,722
does it put pressure on you?

6582
03:31:47,722 --> 03:31:48,600
Is it become more popular

6583
03:31:48,600 --> 03:31:53,600
to be a little bit more collected and?

6584
03:31:53,879 --> 03:31:55,629
- Man, I think the opposite, right?

6585
03:31:56,506 --> 03:31:59,027
'Cause the people I
follow are interesting,

6586
03:31:59,027 --> 03:32:00,780
'cause they say whatever they think

6587
03:32:00,780 --> 03:32:02,760
and they ship or whatever.

6588
03:32:02,760 --> 03:32:04,050
It's so boring that people

6589
03:32:04,049 --> 03:32:06,156
start tweeting only about one topic.

6590
03:32:06,156 --> 03:32:07,059
- Yeah.
- I don't know anything

6591
03:32:07,059 --> 03:32:08,039
about their personal life.

6592
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:09,000
I wanna know about their personal life.

6593
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:09,833
Like you do podcasts,

6594
03:32:09,833 --> 03:32:11,307
you ask about life stuff of personality.

6595
03:32:11,307 --> 03:32:14,640
That's the most interesting
part of business or sports.

6596
03:32:14,639 --> 03:32:16,680
What's the behind the
sport, the athlete, right?

6597
03:32:16,680 --> 03:32:17,790
Behind the entrepreneur.
- Yeah.

6598
03:32:17,790 --> 03:32:19,590
- That's interesting stuff.
- To be human.

6599
03:32:19,590 --> 03:32:20,423
- Yeah.

6600
03:32:21,988 --> 03:32:23,789
I shared a tweet went too far,

6601
03:32:23,790 --> 03:32:25,582
but we were cleaning the toilet

6602
03:32:25,582 --> 03:32:27,090
'cause the toilet was clogged.

6603
03:32:27,090 --> 03:32:28,500
But it's just real stuff,

6604
03:32:28,500 --> 03:32:30,059
'cause Jensen Huang, the Nvidia guy,

6605
03:32:30,059 --> 03:32:32,279
he says, he started cleaning toilets.

6606
03:32:32,280 --> 03:32:33,113
- That was cool.

6607
03:32:33,112 --> 03:32:36,899
You tweeted something about
the Denny's thing, I forget.

6608
03:32:36,899 --> 03:32:37,745
- Yeah, it was recent.

6609
03:32:37,745 --> 03:32:41,429
Nvidia was started in
a Denny's diner table.

6610
03:32:41,430 --> 03:32:42,996
- And you made it somehow profound.

6611
03:32:42,995 --> 03:32:44,709
- [Pieter] Yeah, this one, this one.

6612
03:32:44,709 --> 03:32:47,849
- Nvidia, a $3 trillion
company was started

6613
03:32:47,850 --> 03:32:50,159
in a Denny's, an American diner.

6614
03:32:50,159 --> 03:32:52,680
People need a third space
to work on their laptops

6615
03:32:52,680 --> 03:32:55,050
to build the next billion
or trillion dollar company.

6616
03:32:55,049 --> 03:32:56,519
What's the first and second space?

6617
03:32:56,520 --> 03:32:59,310
- The home office.
- And then the in between.

6618
03:32:59,309 --> 03:33:00,449
The island.
- Yeah, I guess, yeah.

6619
03:33:00,450 --> 03:33:01,380
- The island.
- Yeah.

6620
03:33:01,379 --> 03:33:03,389
You need a space to like congregate.

6621
03:33:03,389 --> 03:33:04,769
Man, and I found history on this.

6622
03:33:04,770 --> 03:33:08,370
So 400 years ago in the
coffee house of Europe.

6623
03:33:08,370 --> 03:33:12,810
The scientific revolution,
the enlightenment happened

6624
03:33:12,809 --> 03:33:14,159
because they would go to coffee houses,

6625
03:33:14,159 --> 03:33:14,993
they would sit there,

6626
03:33:14,993 --> 03:33:16,743
they would drink coffee
and they would work.

6627
03:33:16,743 --> 03:33:17,819
They would work.

6628
03:33:17,819 --> 03:33:20,100
They would write and they would do debates

6629
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:23,283
and they would organize
marine routes, right?

6630
03:33:23,282 --> 03:33:25,829
They would do all the stuff
in Coffeehouse in Europe,

6631
03:33:25,829 --> 03:33:29,069
in France, in Austria, in UK, in Holland.

6632
03:33:29,069 --> 03:33:32,850
So we were always going to cafes to work

6633
03:33:32,850 --> 03:33:35,370
and to have serendipitous conversations

6634
03:33:35,370 --> 03:33:38,163
with other people and
start business and stuff.

6635
03:33:39,904 --> 03:33:41,579
And like you asked me to come on here

6636
03:33:41,579 --> 03:33:42,600
and we flew to America,

6637
03:33:42,600 --> 03:33:44,610
and the first thing I realized was that

6638
03:33:44,610 --> 03:33:45,720
I've been to America before,

6639
03:33:45,719 --> 03:33:49,349
but we were in this cafe and
there's a lot of laptops.

6640
03:33:49,350 --> 03:33:50,460
Everybody's working on something.

6641
03:33:50,459 --> 03:33:51,962
And I took this photo,

6642
03:33:53,213 --> 03:33:54,600
and then when you're in Europe,

6643
03:33:54,600 --> 03:33:56,002
like large parts of Europe now,

6644
03:33:56,002 --> 03:33:58,380
you cannot use a laptop anymore.

6645
03:33:58,379 --> 03:33:59,422
It's like no laptop.

6646
03:33:59,423 --> 03:34:01,170
Which I understand.

6647
03:34:01,170 --> 03:34:05,340
- But that is to you, a
fundamental place to create shit.

6648
03:34:05,340 --> 03:34:09,713
Isn't that natural, organic
coworking space of a coffee?

6649
03:34:09,713 --> 03:34:10,547
- Well, for a lot of people.

6650
03:34:10,547 --> 03:34:12,022
A lot of people have very small homes-

6651
03:34:12,022 --> 03:34:12,855
- [Lex] Yeah.

6652
03:34:12,854 --> 03:34:15,002
- And coworking spaces are kind of boring.

6653
03:34:15,870 --> 03:34:17,160
They're private.

6654
03:34:17,159 --> 03:34:20,484
They're not serendipitous, kinda boring.

6655
03:34:20,484 --> 03:34:23,640
Cafes are amazing 'cause
random people can come in

6656
03:34:23,639 --> 03:34:26,069
and ask you what are you
working on, or you know.

6657
03:34:26,069 --> 03:34:26,940
And not just laptops,

6658
03:34:26,940 --> 03:34:28,770
people are also having conversations

6659
03:34:28,770 --> 03:34:30,690
like they did 400 years
ago debates or whatever.

6660
03:34:30,690 --> 03:34:31,920
Things are happening.

6661
03:34:31,920 --> 03:34:33,962
And man, I understand
the aesthetics of it.

6662
03:34:33,962 --> 03:34:38,403
It's like, oh, startup bro,
shipping is a bullshit startup.

6663
03:34:40,079 --> 03:34:41,340
But there's something more there.

6664
03:34:41,340 --> 03:34:43,110
There's people actually making stuff,

6665
03:34:43,110 --> 03:34:46,176
making new companies that
the society benefits from.

6666
03:34:46,175 --> 03:34:48,090
We're benefiting from Nvidia.

6667
03:34:48,090 --> 03:34:51,930
I think it's the US GDP for
sure is benefiting from Nvidia,

6668
03:34:51,930 --> 03:34:55,170
European GDB could benefit
if we build more companies.

6669
03:34:55,170 --> 03:34:57,100
And I feel in Europe there's this vibe

6670
03:34:58,629 --> 03:34:59,519
and you have to connect things.

6671
03:34:59,520 --> 03:35:01,560
But not allowing laptops in cafes

6672
03:35:01,559 --> 03:35:03,930
is kind of like part of
the vibe, which is like,

6673
03:35:03,930 --> 03:35:05,159
yeah, we're not really here to work.

6674
03:35:05,159 --> 03:35:06,360
We're here to like enjoy life.

6675
03:35:06,360 --> 03:35:08,370
I agree with this Anthony Bourdain,

6676
03:35:08,370 --> 03:35:11,010
like this tweet was quote to
Anthony Bourdain photo of him

6677
03:35:11,010 --> 03:35:13,013
with cigarettes and a coffee in France.

6678
03:35:13,013 --> 03:35:15,180
And he said, "This is
what the cafes are for."

6679
03:35:15,180 --> 03:35:16,013
I agree.

6680
03:35:16,013 --> 03:35:18,579
- But there is some element
of like entrepreneurship.

6681
03:35:19,500 --> 03:35:22,229
You have to allow people to dream big

6682
03:35:22,229 --> 03:35:24,510
and work their ass off towards that dream.

6683
03:35:24,510 --> 03:35:26,909
And then feel each other's
energy as they interact with.

6684
03:35:26,909 --> 03:35:27,743
- [Pieter] Yes.

6685
03:35:27,743 --> 03:35:29,069
- That's one of the things
I liked in Silicon Valley

6686
03:35:29,069 --> 03:35:30,989
when I was working there,

6687
03:35:30,989 --> 03:35:32,760
is the cafes.
- Yeah.

6688
03:35:32,760 --> 03:35:34,229
- There's a bunch of dreamers.

6689
03:35:34,229 --> 03:35:35,699
You can make fun of them for like,

6690
03:35:35,700 --> 03:35:36,533
everybody thinks they're gonna build-

6691
03:35:36,532 --> 03:35:37,889
- Sure.
- A trillion dollar company,

6692
03:35:37,889 --> 03:35:38,762
but like-
- Yeah, and it's off.

6693
03:35:38,763 --> 03:35:39,870
It's not everybody wins.

6694
03:35:39,870 --> 03:35:40,800
99% of people-
- Yeah.

6695
03:35:40,799 --> 03:35:41,632
- Will be bullshit.

6696
03:35:41,632 --> 03:35:42,869
- But they're working their ass off.

6697
03:35:42,870 --> 03:35:44,090
- Yeah, and they're doing something,

6698
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:47,130
and you need to pass this StartupBros.

6699
03:35:47,129 --> 03:35:47,969
Oh, it's StartupBros level.

6700
03:35:47,969 --> 03:35:48,802
No, it's not.

6701
03:35:48,802 --> 03:35:49,920
It's people making cool shit.

6702
03:35:49,920 --> 03:35:50,753
- Yeah.
- And this will benefit you

6703
03:35:50,753 --> 03:35:52,319
'cause this will create jobs

6704
03:35:52,319 --> 03:35:55,199
for your country and your region.

6705
03:35:55,200 --> 03:35:58,710
And I think in Europe
that's a big problem.

6706
03:35:58,709 --> 03:36:02,969
We have a very
anti-entrepreneurial mindset.

6707
03:36:02,969 --> 03:36:04,306
- Dream big and build shit.
- Yeah.

6708
03:36:04,307 --> 03:36:05,820
- I mean this is really inspiring.

6709
03:36:05,819 --> 03:36:08,039
This has been tweet of yours.

6710
03:36:08,040 --> 03:36:10,440
All the projects that you've tried

6711
03:36:10,440 --> 03:36:11,943
and the ones that succeeded.

6712
03:36:13,110 --> 03:36:14,790
- Has very few.
- Mute life.

6713
03:36:14,790 --> 03:36:18,990
- [Pieter] It was for Twitter
to share the mute list.

6714
03:36:18,989 --> 03:36:20,606
- Yeah.

6715
03:36:20,606 --> 03:36:22,680
- Your mute words.
- Fire calculator.

6716
03:36:22,680 --> 03:36:25,229
No more Google, make a rank.

6717
03:36:25,229 --> 03:36:27,029
How much is my site project worth?

6718
03:36:27,030 --> 03:36:29,760
Climate Finder, Ideas AI.

6719
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:31,729
- AirlineList still runs,
but it doesn't make money.

6720
03:36:31,729 --> 03:36:34,920
AirlineList like compares
the safety of airlines

6721
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:36,479
because I was nervous to fly.

6722
03:36:36,479 --> 03:36:39,119
So I was like, let's collect
all the data on crashes

6723
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:40,560
for all the airplanes.

6724
03:36:40,559 --> 03:36:42,346
- Bali sea cable.

6725
03:36:42,346 --> 03:36:44,403
Nice, that's awesome.

6726
03:36:45,420 --> 03:36:48,629
Make village, nomad gear, 3D,

6727
03:36:48,629 --> 03:36:50,054
and virtual reality dev,

6728
03:36:50,055 --> 03:36:53,100
play in my inbox like you mentioned.

6729
03:36:53,100 --> 03:36:54,239
There's a lot of stuff.

6730
03:36:54,239 --> 03:36:55,469
- Yeah, man.
- I'm trying to find some

6731
03:36:55,469 --> 03:36:56,909
embarrassing tweets of yours.

6732
03:36:56,909 --> 03:36:58,010
- You can go to the highlight tab.

6733
03:36:58,010 --> 03:37:00,540
It has all like the good shit kind.

6734
03:37:00,540 --> 03:37:02,790
- There you go.
- This was Dubai.

6735
03:37:02,790 --> 03:37:04,893
- POV, building an AI startup.

6736
03:37:06,569 --> 03:37:08,234
Wow, you're a real influencer.

6737
03:37:08,234 --> 03:37:11,006
- (laughs) And if people
copy this photo now

6738
03:37:11,006 --> 03:37:12,539
and they change the screenshots.

6739
03:37:12,540 --> 03:37:14,400
It becomes like a meme.
(Lex laughs)

6740
03:37:14,399 --> 03:37:17,969
Of course, you know.
- (laughs) This is good.

6741
03:37:17,969 --> 03:37:19,649
- That's how Dubai looks, it's insane.

6742
03:37:19,649 --> 03:37:20,483
- That's beautiful.

6743
03:37:20,483 --> 03:37:21,316
Architectural wise.

6744
03:37:21,316 --> 03:37:22,260
It's crazy.

6745
03:37:22,260 --> 03:37:23,460
The story behind these cities.

6746
03:37:23,459 --> 03:37:25,229
- Yeah, the story behind for sure.

6747
03:37:25,229 --> 03:37:27,180
So this is about the
European economy where like.

6748
03:37:27,180 --> 03:37:29,399
- European economy landscape
is ran by dinosaurs,

6749
03:37:29,399 --> 03:37:30,359
and today I studied this

6750
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:34,079
so I can produce you with my evidence.

6751
03:37:34,079 --> 03:37:38,219
80% of top EU companies
were founded before 1950.

6752
03:37:38,219 --> 03:37:42,090
Only 36% of top US companies
were founded before 1950.

6753
03:37:42,090 --> 03:37:44,940
- Yeah, so the median
founding of companies in US

6754
03:37:44,940 --> 03:37:46,170
is something like 1960,

6755
03:37:47,161 --> 03:37:49,559
and the top companies, right?

6756
03:37:49,559 --> 03:37:53,100
And the median in Europe
is like 1,900 or something.

6757
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:56,579
- Yeah.
- So it's here 1913 and 1963.

6758
03:37:56,579 --> 03:37:58,350
So there's a 50th difference.

6759
03:37:58,350 --> 03:38:01,050
- It's a good representation

6760
03:38:01,049 --> 03:38:02,309
of the very thing you were talking about,

6761
03:38:02,309 --> 03:38:03,989
the difference in the cultures,

6762
03:38:03,989 --> 03:38:06,059
entrepreneurial, spirit of the peoples.

6763
03:38:06,059 --> 03:38:07,282
- But Europe used to be entrepreneurial.

6764
03:38:07,282 --> 03:38:10,529
There was companies founded
in 1800, 1850, 1900.

6765
03:38:10,530 --> 03:38:14,523
It flipped like around 1950
where America took the lead.

6766
03:38:15,840 --> 03:38:16,673
And I guess my point is like,

6767
03:38:16,673 --> 03:38:18,210
I hope that Europe gets back to,

6768
03:38:18,209 --> 03:38:19,042
'cause I'm European,

6769
03:38:19,042 --> 03:38:20,399
I hope that Europe gets back to

6770
03:38:20,399 --> 03:38:21,629
being an entrepreneurial culture

6771
03:38:21,629 --> 03:38:23,519
where they build big companies again.

6772
03:38:23,520 --> 03:38:25,649
'Cause right now,

6773
03:38:25,649 --> 03:38:28,350
all the old dinosaur companies
control the economies.

6774
03:38:28,350 --> 03:38:30,360
They're lobbying with the government.

6775
03:38:30,360 --> 03:38:31,230
Europe is also,

6776
03:38:31,229 --> 03:38:32,879
they're infiltrated with the government

6777
03:38:32,879 --> 03:38:35,699
where they create so much regulation,

6778
03:38:35,700 --> 03:38:37,320
I think it's called
regulatory capture, right?

6779
03:38:37,319 --> 03:38:40,529
Where it's very hard
for a newcomer to join

6780
03:38:40,530 --> 03:38:41,430
and to enter an industry

6781
03:38:41,430 --> 03:38:42,739
because there's too much regulation.

6782
03:38:42,739 --> 03:38:44,819
So actually regulation is
very good for big companies

6783
03:38:44,819 --> 03:38:46,020
'cause they can follow it.

6784
03:38:46,020 --> 03:38:47,370
I can't follow it, right?

6785
03:38:47,370 --> 03:38:49,093
If I wanna start an AI
startup in Europe now,

6786
03:38:49,093 --> 03:38:52,020
I cannot because there's an AI regulation

6787
03:38:52,020 --> 03:38:54,149
that makes it very complicated for me.

6788
03:38:54,149 --> 03:38:56,010
I probably need to get
like notaries involved.

6789
03:38:56,010 --> 03:38:57,903
I need to get certificates licenses.

6790
03:38:59,069 --> 03:39:01,079
Whereas in America, I
can just open my laptop.

6791
03:39:01,079 --> 03:39:06,079
I can start a AI startup
right now, mostly.

6792
03:39:06,149 --> 03:39:07,529
- What do you think about e/acc,

6793
03:39:07,530 --> 03:39:09,600
effective accelerationist movement?

6794
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:11,159
- Man, you had Beff Jezos on,

6795
03:39:11,159 --> 03:39:13,889
I love Beff Jezos and he's amazing.

6796
03:39:13,889 --> 03:39:17,340
And I think e/acc is very needed to

6797
03:39:17,340 --> 03:39:20,880
similarly create a more
positive outlook on the future.

6798
03:39:20,879 --> 03:39:23,829
Because people have been very pessimistic

6799
03:39:24,823 --> 03:39:27,632
about society, about
the future of society,

6800
03:39:28,739 --> 03:39:30,333
climate change, all this stuff.

6801
03:39:31,889 --> 03:39:34,680
E/acc is a positive outlook in the future.

6802
03:39:34,680 --> 03:39:36,600
It's like technology can make us,

6803
03:39:36,600 --> 03:39:37,800
we need to spend more energy.

6804
03:39:37,799 --> 03:39:40,319
We should find ways to of
course get like clean energy.

6805
03:39:40,319 --> 03:39:43,680
But we need to spend more
energy to make cooler stuff

6806
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:44,970
and go into space,

6807
03:39:44,969 --> 03:39:48,449
and build more technology
that can improve society.

6808
03:39:48,450 --> 03:39:51,120
And we shouldn't shy away from technology.

6809
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:52,980
Technology can be the
answer for many things.

6810
03:39:52,979 --> 03:39:54,689
- Yeah, build more.

6811
03:39:54,690 --> 03:39:56,159
Don't spend so much time-
- Yeah.

6812
03:39:56,159 --> 03:39:58,950
- On fearmongering and cautiousness

6813
03:39:58,950 --> 03:39:59,783
and all this kind of stuff.

6814
03:39:59,782 --> 03:40:02,069
Something is okay, something is good,

6815
03:40:02,069 --> 03:40:04,860
but most of the time
should be spent on building

6816
03:40:04,860 --> 03:40:05,846
and creating on-
- Yeah.

6817
03:40:05,846 --> 03:40:07,653
- And doing so unapologetically.

6818
03:40:08,579 --> 03:40:11,340
It's a refreshing reminder of what made

6819
03:40:11,340 --> 03:40:12,579
United States great is all the builders,

6820
03:40:12,579 --> 03:40:14,331
like you said, the entrepreneurs.

6821
03:40:14,331 --> 03:40:15,164
- [Pieter] Yeah.

6822
03:40:15,164 --> 03:40:17,040
- We can't forget that in all the sort of

6823
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:18,630
discussions of how things could go wrong

6824
03:40:18,629 --> 03:40:20,219
with technology and
all this kind of stuff.

6825
03:40:20,219 --> 03:40:21,569
- Yeah, it goes Kaluga, China.

6826
03:40:21,569 --> 03:40:23,459
China's now at the stage
of like America, what?

6827
03:40:23,459 --> 03:40:24,869
Like 1900 or something.

6828
03:40:24,870 --> 03:40:27,360
They're building rapidly insane.

6829
03:40:27,360 --> 03:40:29,909
And obviously, China's massive problems.

6830
03:40:29,909 --> 03:40:31,186
But that comes with the whole thing

6831
03:40:31,186 --> 03:40:32,789
that comes with American is beginning

6832
03:40:32,790 --> 03:40:34,440
all that massive problems, right?

6833
03:40:37,586 --> 03:40:39,779
But I think it's very
dangerous for a country

6834
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:41,550
or a region like Europe to,

6835
03:40:41,549 --> 03:40:44,646
you get to this point where
you're kind of complacent

6836
03:40:44,647 --> 03:40:46,320
and you're kind of comfortable

6837
03:40:46,319 --> 03:40:48,750
and then you can either go this

6838
03:40:48,750 --> 03:40:49,799
or you can go this way, right?

6839
03:40:49,799 --> 03:40:51,389
You're from here, you go like this,

6840
03:40:51,389 --> 03:40:52,799
and then you can go this or this.

6841
03:40:52,799 --> 03:40:54,225
I think you should go this way.

6842
03:40:54,226 --> 03:40:57,273
- (laughs) And go off.
- Yeah, go off.

6843
03:40:59,549 --> 03:41:00,809
I think it's the problem is

6844
03:41:00,809 --> 03:41:02,129
the mind culture.

6845
03:41:02,129 --> 03:41:04,079
So eacc, I made EU Acc,

6846
03:41:04,079 --> 03:41:05,461
which is like the
European kind of version.

6847
03:41:05,461 --> 03:41:06,629
(Lex laughs)

6848
03:41:06,629 --> 03:41:07,649
I made like hoodies and stuff.

6849
03:41:07,649 --> 03:41:09,000
So a lot of people wear like,

6850
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:10,649
this make Europe great again hat.

6851
03:41:11,579 --> 03:41:12,413
- Yeah.

6852
03:41:12,413 --> 03:41:14,130
- I made it red first, but
it became too like Trump.

6853
03:41:14,129 --> 03:41:16,559
So now it's more like European blue.

6854
03:41:16,559 --> 03:41:17,760
Make Europe great again.

6855
03:41:19,721 --> 03:41:20,555
- All right.

6856
03:41:22,200 --> 03:41:25,413
Okay, so you had incredible life.

6857
03:41:26,370 --> 03:41:28,250
Very successful, built
a lot of cool stuff.

6858
03:41:28,250 --> 03:41:30,090
So what advice would
you give to young people

6859
03:41:30,090 --> 03:41:31,340
about how to do the same?

6860
03:41:32,250 --> 03:41:33,510
- Man, I would listen to like nobody.

6861
03:41:33,510 --> 03:41:37,052
Just do what you think is good
and follow your heart, right?

6862
03:41:38,159 --> 03:41:39,299
Everybody peer press you

6863
03:41:39,299 --> 03:41:41,609
into doing stuff you don't wanna do.

6864
03:41:41,610 --> 03:41:42,750
And they tell you,

6865
03:41:42,750 --> 03:41:45,479
parents or family or society tell you,

6866
03:41:45,479 --> 03:41:47,789
but try your own thing,

6867
03:41:47,790 --> 03:41:49,800
'cause it might work out.

6868
03:41:49,799 --> 03:41:51,359
You can steer the ship.

6869
03:41:51,360 --> 03:41:53,010
It probably doesn't work out immediately.

6870
03:41:53,010 --> 03:41:55,139
You probably go into very bad times

6871
03:41:55,139 --> 03:41:57,359
like I did as well, relatively, right?

6872
03:41:57,360 --> 03:41:58,680
But in the end, if you're smart about it,

6873
03:41:58,680 --> 03:41:59,996
you can make things work

6874
03:41:59,996 --> 03:42:02,399
and you can create your
own little life of things

6875
03:42:02,399 --> 03:42:03,690
as you did, as I did.

6876
03:42:03,690 --> 03:42:06,720
And I think that should be more promoted.

6877
03:42:06,719 --> 03:42:07,559
Do your own thing.

6878
03:42:07,559 --> 03:42:08,729
There's space in economy

6879
03:42:08,729 --> 03:42:11,129
and in society for do your own thing.

6880
03:42:11,129 --> 03:42:13,500
- Yeah.
- It's like little villages,

6881
03:42:13,500 --> 03:42:14,459
everybody would sell.

6882
03:42:14,459 --> 03:42:15,889
I would sell bread, you would sell meat.

6883
03:42:15,889 --> 03:42:17,340
Everybody can do their own little thing.

6884
03:42:17,340 --> 03:42:21,003
You don't need to be a normie as you say.

6885
03:42:22,763 --> 03:42:25,079
You can be what you really wanna be.

6886
03:42:25,079 --> 03:42:27,760
- And go all out doing that thing.

6887
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:28,907
- Yeah, you gotta go all out

6888
03:42:28,906 --> 03:42:33,059
'cause if you half ass
it, you cannot succeed.

6889
03:42:33,059 --> 03:42:36,719
You need to go lean in
to the outcast stuff.

6890
03:42:36,719 --> 03:42:39,269
Lean in to the being different,

6891
03:42:39,270 --> 03:42:42,067
and just doing whatever it
is that you wanna do, right?

6892
03:42:42,066 --> 03:42:44,609
- You got a whole asset.

6893
03:42:44,610 --> 03:42:46,200
- Yeah, whole assets, yeah.

6894
03:42:46,200 --> 03:42:47,820
- This was an incredible conversation.

6895
03:42:47,819 --> 03:42:49,469
It was an honor to finally meet you.

6896
03:42:49,469 --> 03:42:50,302
Finally.

6897
03:42:50,302 --> 03:42:51,136
- It was an honor to be here, Lex.

6898
03:42:51,136 --> 03:42:52,979
- To talk to you and
keep doing your thing.

6899
03:42:52,979 --> 03:42:56,100
Keep inspiring me and the world

6900
03:42:56,100 --> 03:42:57,750
with all the cool stuff you're building.

03:42:57,750 --> 03:42:59,430

with some words from Drew Houston,

Dropbox Co-founder, by
the way, I love Dropbox.

worry about failure.
