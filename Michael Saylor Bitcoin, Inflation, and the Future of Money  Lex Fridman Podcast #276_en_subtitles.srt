1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:02,732
- Remember George Washington,
you know how he died?

2
00:00:02,732 --> 00:00:05,079
Well-meaning physicians bled him to death.

3
00:00:05,078 --> 00:00:08,134
And this was the most important
patient in the country,

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,035
maybe in the history of the country.

5
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:14,467
And we bled him to death
trying to help him.

6
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:18,679
So when you're actually
inflating the money supply at 7%,

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,762
but you're calling it 2%

8
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,961
because you want to help the economy,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,210
you're literally bleeding
the free market to death.

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,896
But the sad fact is George
Washington went along with it

11
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:33,880
'cause he thought that they
were gonna do him good.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,880
And the majority of the
society, most companies,

13
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:44,561
most conventional thinkers,
the working class,

14
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,182
they go along with this because they think

15
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:50,306
that someone has their
best interest in mind.

16
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:54,343
And the people that are
bleeding them to death believe,

17
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:55,828
they believe that prescription

18
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:59,995
because their mental models
are just so defective.

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,344
- The following is a
conversation with Michael Saylor,

20
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:05,186
one of the most prominent and brilliant

21
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,250
Bitcoin proponents in the world.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,671
He is the CEO of MicroStrategy,
founder of Saylor Academy,

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,004
graduate of MIT.

24
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,548
And Michael is one of the most fascinating

25
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:18,799
and rigorous thinkers
I've ever gotten a chance

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,388
to explore ideas with.

27
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:23,173
He can effortlessly zoom
out to the big perspectives

28
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,650
of human civilization and human history,

29
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,847
and zoom back in to the
technical details of blockchains,

30
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,418
markets, governments,
and financial systems.

31
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:35,367
This is the, "Lex Fridman Podcast."

To support it, please check out

33
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,768
our sponsors in the description.

34
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:42,518
And now, dear friends,
here's Michael Saylor.

35
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:48,587
Let's start with a big
question of truth and wisdom.

36
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,745
When advanced humans,
or aliens or AI systems,

37
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:53,703
let's say five to 10 centuries from now,

38
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:57,536
look back at Earth on
this early 21st century,

39
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,684
how much do you think they
would say we understood about

40
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:05,257
money and economics, or
even about engineering,

41
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,700
science, life, death,
meaning, intelligence,

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,586
consciousness, all the
big interesting questions?

43
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:17,419
- I think they would probably
give us a B- on engineering,

44
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,782
on all the engineering things.

45
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:22,981
The hard sciences.

46
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,675
- [Lex] A passing grade.

47
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,644
- Like we're doing okay.

48
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,603
We're working our way
through rockets and jets

49
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:33,221
and electric cars and
electricity, transport systems

50
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,927
and nuclear power and
space flight and the like.

51
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:39,260
And if you look at the walls

52
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,120
that grace the great court at MIT,

53
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,070
it's full of all the great thinkers

54
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,278
and they're all pretty admirable.

55
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:53,528
If you could be with Newton
or Gauss or Madam Curie

56
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:58,144
or Einstein, you would respect them.

57
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:04,104
I would say they'd give
us like a D- on economics.

58
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,334
Like an F+ or a D-.

59
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,176
- You see even an optimistic vision.

60
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,302
First of all, optimistic
vision of engineering

61
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:15,430
because everybody you've
listed, not everybody,

62
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,269
but most people you've listed

63
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,734
is just over the past couple of centuries

64
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,670
and maybe stretches a little farther back.

65
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,739
But mostly all the cool stuff
we've done in engineering,

66
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,930
is the past couple of centuries.

67
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,262
- I mean, Archimedes had his virtues.

68
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,237
(Lex chuckles)

69
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:33,822
I studied the history of science at MIT

70
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:36,277
and I also studied aerospace engineering,

71
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:40,216
and so I clearly have a
bias in favor of science.

72
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:42,875
And if I look at the past 10,000 years,

73
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,729
and I consider all of the
philosophy and the politics

74
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,742
and their impact on the human
condition, I think it's awash

75
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,882
for every politician that
came up with a good idea.

76
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,983
Another politician came
up with a bad idea,

77
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:57,594
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

78
00:03:57,594 --> 00:04:00,836
- And it's not clear to me
that most of the political

79
00:04:00,836 --> 00:04:05,704
and philosophical
contributions to the human race

80
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,802
and the human conditions
have advanced so much.

81
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,883
I mean, we're still taking guidance

82
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:16,634
and admiring Aristotle and
Plato and Seneca and the like.

83
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:21,610
And on the other hand if you think about

84
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,102
what has made the human condition better.

85
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:28,351
Fire, water, harnessing of wind energy.

86
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,795
Like try to row across an ocean, right?

87
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,326
Not easy.

88
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:38,186
- And for people who are
just listening or watching,

89
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:42,404
there's a beautiful, sexy
ship from 16th, 17th century.

90
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:44,675
- This is a 19th century handmade model

91
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:48,892
of a 17th century sailing
ship, which is of the type

92
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:51,142
that the Dutch East India Company

93
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:54,442
used to sail the world and trade.

94
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:57,490
So that was made, you
know, the original was made

95
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,574
sometime in the 1600s.

96
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,327
And then this model is made

97
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,941
in the 19th century by individuals.

98
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,358
- Both the model and the ship itself

99
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:08,016
is engineering at its best.

100
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,186
And just imagine just like
rock is flying out the space,

101
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,368
how much hope this filled people with,

102
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:16,202
exploring the unknown,
going into the mystery,

103
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:20,009
both the entrepreneurs
and the business people

104
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:22,534
and the engineers and just humans.

105
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:23,368
What's out there?

106
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,862
What's out there to be discovered?

107
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,943
- Yeah, the metaphor of human beings

108
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:29,956
leaving shore sailing across the horizon,

109
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,389
risking their lives in
pursuit of a better life

110
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,805
is a incredibly powerful one.

111
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:40,618
In 1900, I suppose the
average life expectancy is 50.

112
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,846
During the Revolutionary War,
while our founding fathers

113
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,185
were fighting to establish life, liberty,

114
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:51,250
pursuit of happiness, the constitution,

115
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,006
average life expectancy of it's like 32,

116
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:57,114
somewhere between 32 and 36.

117
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:57,947
- [Lex] Yeah.

118
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,521
- So all the sound and the fury

119
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:02,743
doesn't make you live past
32, but what does, right?

120
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:03,744
Antibiotics.

121
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,802
Conquest of infectious diseases.

122
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:10,944
If we understand the science
of infectious disease.

123
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:14,778
Sterilizing a knife and
harnessing antibiotics

124
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:18,002
gets you from 50 to 70.

125
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,163
And that happened fast, right?

126
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:23,663
That happens from 1900 to
1950 or something like that.

127
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:29,095
And I think if you look
at the human condition,

128
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:31,888
you ever get on one of
those rowing machines

129
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,509
where they actually keep
track of your watts output

130
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:36,180
when you're on the-
- [Lex] Yeah.

131
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,764
- It's like 200 is a lot, okay?

132
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,708
200 is a lot.

133
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,737
So a kilowatt hour is like
all the energy that a human,

134
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,987
a trained athlete can deliver in a day.

135
00:06:50,605 --> 00:06:54,269
And probably not 1% of
the people in the world

136
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,703
could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day.

137
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:59,349
And the commercial value
of a kilowatt hour,

138
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,430
the retail value is 11 cents today.

139
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,980
And the wholesale value is 2 cents.

140
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,563
And so you have to look
at the contribution

141
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,884
of politicians and
philosophers and economists

142
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,543
to the human condition.

143
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:19,206
And it's like at best of
wash one way or the other.

144
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,759
And then if you look at the contribution

145
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,168
of John D. Rockefeller
when he delivered you

146
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:25,947
a barrel of oil.

147
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:29,798
Yeah, and the energy
in oil, liquid energy,

148
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:34,798
or the contribution of Tesla,
as we deliver electricity.

149
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:38,726
And what's the impact
of the human condition

150
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:43,726
if I have electric power,
if I have chemical power,

151
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:48,220
if I have wind energy, if I can
actually set up a reservoir,

152
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,637
create a dam, spin a turbine,

153
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:55,288
and generate energy
from a hydraulic source,

154
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:58,348
that's extraordinary, right?

155
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,514
And so our ability to cross the ocean,

156
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,515
our ability to grow food,
our ability to live,

157
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:09,435
it's technology that gets the human race

158
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:13,268
from a brutal life where
life expectancy is 30

159
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,560
to a world where life expectancy is 80.

160
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,254
- You gave a D- to the economists,

161
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:24,903
so are they too like
the politicians, awash

162
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,274
in terms of there's good
ideas and bad ideas?

163
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,607
And that tiny delta between good and bad

164
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,639
is how you squeak past the
F+ onto the D- territory.

165
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,894
- I think most economic
ideas are bad ideas.

166
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,726
- [Lex] Most?

167
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:44,559
- Like take us back to
MIT and you wanna solve

168
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,673
a fluid dynamics problem.

169
00:08:47,673 --> 00:08:51,225
Like design the shape of
the hull of that ship,

170
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:54,585
or you wanna design an air foil, a wing.

171
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:59,335
Or if you want to an engine
or a nozzle in a rocket ship,

172
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,734
you wouldn't do it with simple arithmetic,

173
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:06,232
you wouldn't do it with a scaler.

174
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,602
There's not a single number, right?

175
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:11,545
It's vector math,
computational fluid dynamics.

176
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,932
There's end dimensional,
higher level math,

177
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:17,653
complicated stuff.

178
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:21,631
So when an economist says
the inflation rate is 2%,

179
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:22,830
that's a scaler.

180
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,798
And when an economist
says it's not a problem

181
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,292
to print more money because
the velocity of the money

182
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:32,396
is very low, monetary velocity is low.

183
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:34,617
That's another scaler, okay?

184
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:39,285
So the truth of the matter
is inflation is not a scaler.

185
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:43,504
Inflation is an indimensional vector.

186
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:46,087
Money velocity is not a scaler.

187
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:50,632
Saying, what's the velocity of money?

188
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,011
Oh, it's slow or it's fast.

189
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,000
It ignores the question of
what medium is the money

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,387
moving through in the same way

191
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:01,971
that what's the speed of sound?

192
00:10:03,313 --> 00:10:05,509
Okay, well, what is sound, right?

193
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,841
Sound is a compression wave.

194
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:13,052
It's energy moving through a medium,

195
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,711
but the speed is different.

196
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:17,216
So for example, the speed of
sound through air is different

197
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,737
than the speed of sound through water.

198
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:21,949
And sound moves faster through water,

199
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:23,224
it moves faster through a solid,

200
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,755
and it moves faster
through a stiffer solid.

201
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,802
So there isn't one.

202
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,472
- What is the fundamental
problem with the way

203
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:32,604
economists reduce the
world down to a model?

204
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,271
Is it too simple or is it
just even the first principles

205
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,217
of constructing the model is wrong?

206
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,298
- I think that the fundamental problem

207
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:43,298
is if you see the world as a scaler,

208
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,692
you simply pick the one number

209
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,862
which supports whatever you wanna do,

210
00:10:50,863 --> 00:10:54,946
and you ignore the universe
of other consequences

211
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,385
from your behavior.

212
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:58,390
- In general, I don't know

213
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,377
if you've heard of like Eric Watson

214
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:03,700
has been talking about
this with gauge theory.

215
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,003
So different kinds of approaches
from the physics world,

216
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,389
from the mathematical world

217
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,139
to extend past this
scaler view of economics.

218
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:16,574
So gauge theory is one way
that comes from physics.

219
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:21,264
Do you find that way of
exploring economics interesting?

220
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,065
So outside of cryptocurrency,

221
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:24,801
outside of the extra
technologies and so on,

222
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,777
just analysis of how economics works,

223
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:31,013
do you find that interesting?

224
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,644
- Yeah, I think that if we're gonna

225
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:36,414
wanna really make any scientific
progress in economics,

226
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:40,823
we have to apply much more
computationally intensive

227
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:43,859
and richer forms of mathematics.

228
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,791
- So, simulation perhaps?

229
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:50,131
- Yeah, when I was at MIT,
I studied system dynamics,

230
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,563
they taught it at the Sloan School.

231
00:11:51,563 --> 00:11:54,396
It was developed by Jay Forrester,

232
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:59,616
who was an extraordinary
computer scientist.

233
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:03,616
And when we created models
of economic behavior,

234
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:08,920
they were all multidimensional
non-linear models.

235
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,321
So if you wanna describe
how anything works

236
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:14,277
in the real world, you have to start

237
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,197
with the concept of feedback.

238
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:20,200
If I double the price of
something, demand will fall

239
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,547
and attempts to create
supply will increase,

240
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:28,581
and there will be a delay
before the capacity increases.

241
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,260
There'll be an instant demand change,

242
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,284
and there'll be rippling effects

243
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,809
throughout every other
segment of the economy

244
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:37,888
downstream and upstream of such thing.

245
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,110
So it's kind of common
sense, but most economics,

246
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,941
most classical economics,
it's always taught

247
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:48,274
with linear models, fairly
simplistic linear models.

248
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,005
And oftentimes even I'm
really shocked today

249
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:57,323
that the entire mainstream
dialogue of economics

250
00:12:57,323 --> 00:13:01,182
has been captured by scale or arithmetic.

251
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:06,182
For example, if you read any
article in New York Times

252
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,023
or the Wall Street Journal, right?

253
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:10,608
They just refer to there's
an inflation number

254
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:13,774
or the CPI or the inflation rate is X.

255
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,466
And if you look at all
the historic studies

256
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,756
of the impact of inflation,
generally they're all based

257
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:25,006
upon the idea that inflation equals CPI

258
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:28,732
and then they try to
extrapolate from that,

259
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:31,482
and you just get nowhere with it.

260
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:35,851
- So at the very least, we
should be considering inflation

261
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:37,865
and other economics concept

262
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,335
is a non-linear dynamical system.

263
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:43,370
So non-linearity, and also just embracing

264
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,947
the full complexity of just
how the variables interact,

265
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:49,108
maybe through simulation, maybe have some

266
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:50,644
interesting models around that.

267
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,389
- Wouldn't it be refreshing
if somebody for once

268
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:56,576
published a table of the change
in price of every product,

269
00:13:56,576 --> 00:14:01,576
every service, and every asset
and every place over time?

270
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:02,555
- You said table.

271
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,576
Some of that also is the
task of visualization.

272
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:08,495
How to extract from this
complex set of numbers,

273
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,995
patterns that somehow indicate

274
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,383
something fundamental
about what's happening.

275
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:19,163
Summarization of data is still important.

276
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:22,015
Perhaps summarization not down
to a single scale of value,

277
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,697
but looking at that whole sea of numbers,

278
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,697
you have to find patterns
like what is inflation

279
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,628
in a particular sector, what
is maybe change over time,

280
00:14:34,628 --> 00:14:39,609
maybe different geographical
regions, things of that nature.

281
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:42,500
I think that's kinda, I don't
know even what that task is.

282
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,316
That's what you could
look at machine learning,

283
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,014
you can look at AI with that
perspective, which is like,

284
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,911
how do you represent what's
happening efficiently

285
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,529
as efficiently as possible?

286
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,981
That's never going to be a single number,

287
00:14:55,981 --> 00:14:57,554
but it might be a compressed model

288
00:14:57,554 --> 00:14:59,846
that captures something,
something beautiful,

289
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,527
something fundamental
about what's happening.

290
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,694
- It's an opportunity for sure, right?

291
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:12,485
You know, if we take, for
example, during the pandemic,

292
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:17,174
the response of the political apparatus

293
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:20,091
was to lower interest rates to zero

294
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:25,120
and to start buying assets,
in essence printing money.

295
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,622
And the defense was there's no inflation.

296
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,121
- [Lex] Yeah.

297
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,433
- But of course you had
one part of the economy

298
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:37,049
where it was locked down, so
it was illegal to buy anything,

299
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,448
but you couldn't, you
know, it was either illegal

300
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:43,219
or it was impractical,
so it would be impossible

301
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,622
for demand to manifest, so of
course there is no inflation.

302
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:49,462
On the other hand, there was instantaneous

303
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:53,875
immediate inflation in
another part of the economy.

304
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:58,651
For example, you lower the
interest rates to zero.

305
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,875
At one point we saw the
swap rate on a 30 year note

306
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,744
go to 72 basis points, okay?

307
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,710
That means that the value

308
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,054
of a long dated bond immediately inflates.

309
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,423
So the bond market had hyperinflation

310
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:16,090
within minutes of these
financial decisions.

311
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,867
The asset market had hyperinflation.

312
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:23,569
We had what you call a K shape recovery,

313
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,434
what we affectionately
call a K shape recovery.

314
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,398
Main Street shut down,

315
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:31,331
Wall Street recovered
all within six weeks.

316
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,456
The inflation was in the
assets, like in the stocks,

317
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:35,538
in the bonds.

318
00:16:37,485 --> 00:16:41,874
If you look today, you
see that typical house

319
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:43,526
according to the Case-Shiller index today

320
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:46,764
is up 19.2% year over year.

321
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:49,846
So if you're a first time home buyer,

322
00:16:50,883 --> 00:16:54,155
the inflation rate is 19%.

323
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:57,322
The formal CPI announced as 7.9%.

324
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,470
You can pretty much create
any inflation rate you want

325
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,078
by constructing a market basket,

326
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,106
a weighted basket of products

327
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:12,197
or services or assets
that yield you the answer.

328
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,221
I think that the fundamental
failing of economists

329
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:20,843
is first of all, they
don't really have a term

330
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:23,093
for asset inflation, right?

331
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:26,146
- What's an asset?

332
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,819
What's asset hyperinflation?

333
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,939
You mentioned bond market
swap rate and asset

334
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,004
is where the majority of
the hyperinflation happen.

335
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,103
What's inflation?

336
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:37,209
What's hyperinflation?

337
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,453
What's an asset?

338
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:39,724
What's an asset market?

339
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,389
And I'm gonna ask so many dumb questions.

340
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,099
- In the conventional economic world,

341
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:49,098
you would treat inflation as
the rate of increase in price

342
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:52,659
of a market basket of consumer products

343
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,743
defined by a government agency, okay?

344
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,720
- So they have a, like traditional things

345
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,576
that a regular consumer would be buying.

346
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:06,108
The government selects
like toilet paper, food,

347
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:10,352
toaster, refrigerator, electronics,
all that kind of stuff.

348
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:14,231
And it's like a
representative basket of goods

349
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:18,750
that lead to a content
existence on this earth

350
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,931
for a regular consumer.

351
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:23,159
- They define a synthetic metric, right?

352
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,352
I mean, I'm gonna say you should have

353
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,621
a thousand square foot apartment

354
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:29,121
and you should have a used car

355
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,486
and you should eat
three hamburgers a week.

356
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:37,716
Now, 10 years go by and
the apartment costs more.

357
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,873
I could adjust the market
basket by a, you know,

358
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:42,584
they call 'em hedonic adjustments.

359
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:45,469
I could decide that it used to be a 1970

360
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:46,846
needed a thousand square feet,

361
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:50,941
but in the year 2020, you
only need 700 square feet

362
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,443
because we've miniaturized televisions

363
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:57,124
and we've got more efficient
electric appliances

364
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,307
and because things have
collapsed into the iPhone,

365
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:00,333
you just don't need as much space.

366
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:05,120
So now it may be that the
apartment costs 50% more,

367
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,890
but after the hedonic
adjustment, there is no inflation

368
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,676
because I just downgraded the expectation

369
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:12,331
of what a normal person should have.

370
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:13,416
- So the synthetic nature of the metric

371
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:17,650
allows for manipulation
by people in power.

372
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:20,222
- (chuckles) Pretty much.

373
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:21,657
I guess my criticism of economist

374
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:24,490
is rather than embracing inflation

375
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:29,236
based upon its fundamental
idea, which is the rate

376
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:33,565
at which the price of things go up, right?

377
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:38,565
They've been captured by
mainstream conventional thinking

378
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:44,076
to immediately equate inflation
to the government issued CPI

379
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:48,455
or government issued PCE or
government issued PPI measure,

380
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:51,826
which was never the rate
at which things go up,

381
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:56,617
it's simply the rate at which
a synthetic basket of products

382
00:19:56,617 --> 00:20:00,608
and services the government
wishes to track go up.

383
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:04,794
Now the problem with
that is two big things.

384
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,508
One thing is the government

385
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,911
gets to create the market basket,

386
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:13,749
and so they keep changing
what's in the basket over time.

387
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:17,062
So I mean, if I said three years ago,

388
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,983
you should go see 10 concerts a year,

389
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,626
and the concert tickets
now cost $200 each.

390
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:24,344
Now it's $2,000 a year to go see concerts.

391
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:27,384
Now I'm in charge of
calculating inflation,

392
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:31,320
so I redefine your
entertainment quota for the year

393
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,978
to be eight Netflix streaming concerts.

394
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,654
And now they don't cost $2,000,

395
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:38,212
they cost nothing and
there is no inflation,

396
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:39,855
but you don't get your concerts, right?

397
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:44,498
So the problem starts
with continually changing

398
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:47,708
the definition of the market basket,

399
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:51,996
but in my opinion, that's
not the biggest problem.

400
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:56,163
The more egregious problem
is the fundamental idea

401
00:20:57,284 --> 00:21:00,863
that assets aren't products or services.

402
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,931
A assets can't be inflated.

403
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:04,244
- [Lex] What's an asset?

404
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,743
- A house, a share of Apple stock, a bond.

405
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,041
A Bitcoin is an asset
or a Picasso painting.

406
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,576
- Not a consumable good?

407
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,409
- [Michael] Yeah.

408
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,092
- Not a apple that you can eat.

409
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:28,092
- Right, if I throw away an
asset, then I'm not on the hook

410
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,770
to track the inflation rate for it.

411
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,138
So what happens if I change
the policy such that,

412
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,086
let's take the classic example.

413
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,551
A million dollar bond
at a 5% interest rate

414
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:42,182
gives you $50,000 a year
in risk-free income,

415
00:21:42,182 --> 00:21:44,248
you might retire on $50,000 a year

416
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:47,284
in a low cost jurisdiction.

417
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:50,005
So the cost of social
security or early retirement

418
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:53,607
is $1 million when the
interest rate is 5%.

419
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:57,310
During the crisis of March of 2020,

420
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,864
the interest rate on a 10-year bond

421
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:01,863
went to 50 basis points, okay?

422
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:06,229
So now the cost of that
bond is $10 million, okay?

423
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:07,610
The cost of social security

424
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:10,003
went from a million
dollars to $10 million.

425
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:13,408
So if you wanted to work
your entire life, save money,

426
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,973
and then retire risk free
and live happily ever after

427
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:20,009
on a $50,000 salary living
on a beach in Mexico,

428
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,792
wherever you wanted to go,
you had hyperinflation,

429
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:28,461
the cost of your aspiration
increased by a factor of 10

430
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,027
over the course of some amount of time.

431
00:22:31,027 --> 00:22:32,741
In fact, in that case, that was like

432
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,825
over the course of about 12 years, right?

433
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:39,825
As the inflation rate ground
down, the asset traded up.

434
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:44,334
But the conventional view
is, oh, that's not a problem

435
00:22:44,334 --> 00:22:46,587
because it's good that assets,

436
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:49,384
it's good that the bond is highly priced

437
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,944
because we own the bond.

438
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:54,652
Or what's the problem
with the inflation rate

439
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:57,221
in housing being 19%?

440
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:59,798
It's an awful problem for a 22-year-old

441
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:01,777
that's starting their first job

442
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,979
that's saving money to buy a house.

443
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:07,415
But it would be characterized
as a benefit to society

444
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,960
by a conventional economist who would say,

445
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,992
"Well, housing asset values are higher

446
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,144
because of interest rate fluctuation

447
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,688
and now the economy's got more wealth."

448
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,605
And so, that's viewed as a benefit.

449
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:24,359
- What's being missed here?

450
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:29,109
Like the suffering of the
average person or the struggle,

451
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:34,665
the suffering, the pain
of the average person,

452
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,777
like metrics that captured
that within the economic system

453
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:38,700
When you're talking about-

454
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,533
- What I'm going to say,

455
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:43,918
it is a conventional
view of inflation as CPI

456
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,706
understates the human
misery that's inflicted

457
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:51,872
upon the working class and
on mainstream companies

458
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,214
by the political class.

459
00:23:58,213 --> 00:24:00,531
And so it's a massive shift to wealth

460
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,519
from the working class
to the property class.

461
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,541
It's a massive shift to
power from the free market

462
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,791
to the centrally governed
or the controlled market.

463
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:12,946
It's a massive shift to power

464
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:15,351
from the people to the government.

465
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:19,855
And maybe one more
illustrative point here, Lex,

466
00:24:19,855 --> 00:24:23,130
is what do you think the inflation rate's

467
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,333
been for the past a hundred years?

468
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,204
- Oh, we talking about the scaler again?

469
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:31,081
- If you took a survey of
everybody on the street

470
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:33,811
and you asked them what do
they think inflation was,

471
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,727
what is it?

472
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:37,156
You remember when Jerome Powell said,

473
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:40,775
our target's 2%, but we're not there.

474
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:44,892
If you go around the corner,
I have posted the deed

475
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:47,642
to this house sold in 1930, okay?

476
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:53,292
And the number on that
deed is $100,000, 1930.

477
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:59,199
And if you go on Zillow
and you get the Zestimate,

478
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,377
- Is it higher than that?

479
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:02,446
No?
- [Michael] $30,500,000.

480
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:03,279
- Yeah.

481
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,029
- So that's 92 years.

482
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,730
1930 or 2022.

483
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:10,708
(Lex chuckles)

484
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:13,958
And in 92 years we've had 305X increase

485
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,561
in price of the house.

486
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,025
Now if you actually back calculate,

487
00:25:20,026 --> 00:25:22,658
you come to a conclusion
that the inflation rate

488
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:27,657
was approximately 6.5% a year
every year for 92 years, okay?

489
00:25:30,098 --> 00:25:33,669
And there's nobody, nobody in government,

490
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,933
no conventional economists
who would ever admit

491
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:39,008
to an inflation rate of 7% a year

492
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:42,068
in the US dollar over the last century.

493
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:45,235
Now, if you dig deeper, I mean one guy

494
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:50,472
that's done a great job working
on this is Saidedean Ammous,

495
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,831
who wrote the book,
"The Bitcoin Standard."

496
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:54,740
And he notes that on average

497
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,216
it looks like the inflation
rate and the money supply

498
00:25:58,215 --> 00:26:03,215
is about 7% a year all the
way up to the year 2020.

499
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,595
If you look at the S&P index,
which is a market basket

500
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:11,178
of scarce desirable stocks,
it returned about 10%.

501
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:16,017
If you talk to 10% a
year for a hundred years.

502
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:19,784
The money supply is expanding
at 7% a hundred years.

503
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:21,814
If you actually talk to economists

504
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,643
or you look at the economy
and you ask the question,

505
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:27,429
how fast does the economy grow

506
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:30,315
in its entirety year over year?

507
00:26:30,315 --> 00:26:31,886
Generally about two to 3%.

508
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:35,060
Like the sum total impact
of all this technology

509
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,535
and human ingenuity might
get you a two and a half,

510
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,253
3% improvement a year

511
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:42,002
- As measured by GDP.

512
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,291
Are you okay with that measure?

513
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:47,353
- I'm not sure I go that far
yet, but I would just say

514
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:51,631
that if you had the
human race doing stuff.

515
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,893
- [Lex] Yeah.
- And if you ask the question,

516
00:26:53,893 --> 00:26:56,317
how much more efficiently
will we do the stuff

517
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:57,588
next year than this year,

518
00:26:57,588 --> 00:27:01,144
or what's the value of
all of our innovations

519
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:05,253
and inventions and investments
in the past 12 months?

520
00:27:05,253 --> 00:27:09,890
You'd be hard pressed to
say, we get 2% better.

521
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:13,940
Typical investor thinks
they're 10% better every year.

522
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,485
So if you look at what's going on,

523
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:19,588
really when you're holding
a million dollars of stocks

524
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,682
and you're getting a 10% gain a year,

525
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:25,795
you're really get a 7%
expansion of the money supply.

526
00:27:25,795 --> 00:27:30,402
You're getting a two or 3%
gain under best circumstances.

527
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:34,132
And another way to say
that is if the money supply

528
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,387
stopped expanding at 7% a year,

529
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,966
the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10%.

530
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,800
It probably should be.

531
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,950
Now, that gets you to start to ask a bunch

532
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,542
of other fundamental questions

533
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,147
like if I borrow a billion
dollars and pay 3% interest

534
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:55,363
and the money supply expands
at seven to 10% a year,

535
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,558
and I ended up making a 10% return

536
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,435
on a billion dollar
investment, paying 3% interest.

537
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:04,285
Is that fair?

538
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,139
And who suffered?

539
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:10,410
So that I could do that
because in an environment

540
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:12,986
where you're just
inflating the money supply

541
00:28:12,986 --> 00:28:15,661
and you're holding the assets constant,

542
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,302
it stands the reason that
the price of all the assets

543
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:21,766
is going to appreciate
somewhat proportional

544
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,813
to the money supply.

545
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:25,888
And the difference in asset appreciations

546
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:27,705
is gonna be a function of the scarce,

547
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,948
desirable quality of the assets,

548
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:32,738
and to what extent can
I make more of them,

549
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:37,071
and to what extent are they
truly limited in supply?

550
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:41,721
- Yeah, so we'll get to a lot
of the words you said there.

551
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:46,137
The scarcity and so connected
to how limited they are

552
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,152
and the value of those assets.

553
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:52,785
But you also said, so the
expansion of the money supply,

554
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:56,368
which is put another
way is printing money.

555
00:28:57,306 --> 00:28:59,146
And so is that always bad?

556
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,869
The expansion of the money supply is this,

557
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,869
just to put some terms on the
table so we understand them.

558
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,468
You nonchalantly say it's always the,

559
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:11,001
on average expanding every year,

560
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:14,263
the money supply is
expanding every year by 7%.

561
00:29:14,263 --> 00:29:15,420
That's a bad thing.

562
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,679
That's a universally a bad thing.

563
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,842
- It's awful.

564
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:22,675
I guess to be precise,
it's the currency that,

565
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,089
I mean, money, I would say money

566
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:30,693
is monetary energy or economic energy.

567
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:34,494
And the economic energy has
to find its way into a medium.

568
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:37,574
So if you wanna move it rapidly
as a medium of exchange,

569
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,452
it has to find its way into currency,

570
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:42,319
but the money can also flow into property

571
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,653
like a house or gold.

572
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:47,207
If the money flows into property,

573
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:50,260
it'll probably hold its value much better

574
00:29:50,259 --> 00:29:52,564
if the money flows into currency, right?

575
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:56,518
If you had put a hundred
thousand dollars in this house,

576
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:59,778
you would have 305X return over 92 years.

577
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:01,237
But if you had put the money,

578
00:30:01,237 --> 00:30:03,586
a hundred thousand dollars
into safe deposit box

579
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:05,539
and buried it in the basement,

580
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,123
you would've lost 99.7% of your wealth

581
00:30:10,115 --> 00:30:12,281
over the same time period.

582
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,375
So, the expansion of the currency

583
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,663
creates a massive
inefficiency in the society,

584
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:22,929
what I'll call an adiabatic lapse.

585
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,179
It's what we're doing is we're bleeding

586
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:29,390
the civilization to death, right?

587
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,797
- What's the, adiabatic, what's that word?

588
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,284
- [Michael] Adiabatic lapse.
- Adiabatic.

589
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,611
- Right, and aerospace engineering,

590
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:38,179
you wanna solve any problem,

591
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:42,247
they start with the phrase,
assume an adiabatic system.

592
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:44,752
And what that means is a closed system,

593
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:47,586
- [Lex] Okay, I've got it.
- So, I've got a container,

594
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:49,488
and in that container no air leaves

595
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:52,875
and no air enters, no
energy exits or enters,

596
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,837
so it's a closed system.

597
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:57,460
- So you got the closed system lapse?

598
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,153
- [Michael] Okay.
(Lex laughs)

599
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,674
Okay, I'm gonna use a.

600
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:02,629
- There's a leak in the ship.

601
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,968
- [Michael] I'm gonna use
a physical metaphor for you

602
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:06,605
'cause you're the jujutsu, right?

603
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:07,439
- Yeah.

604
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,699
- Like you got 10 pints
of blood in your body.

605
00:31:09,699 --> 00:31:12,574
And so before your next workout,

606
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:15,403
I'm gonna take one pint from you.

607
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:16,980
Now you're gonna go exercise,

608
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,400
but you've lost 10% of your blood, okay?

609
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,262
You're not gonna perform as well.

610
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,798
It takes about one month for your body

611
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:28,041
to replace the red blood platelets.

612
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,386
So what if I tell you every month

613
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,445
you gotta show up and I'm gonna bleed you?

614
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:32,278
- [Lex] Yeah.

615
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,709
- Okay, so if I'm draining the energy,

616
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:38,413
I'm draining the blood from your body.

617
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:40,030
You can't perform.

618
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,916
Adiabatic lapse is when
you go up an altitude.

619
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,146
Every thousand feet,
you lose three degrees.

620
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,553
You go at 50,000 feet,

621
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:50,550
you're 150 degrees colder than sea level.

622
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:53,750
That's why you look at your instruments

623
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,911
and instead of 80 degrees,
you're minus 70 degrees.

624
00:31:56,911 --> 00:31:59,221
Why is the temperature falling?

625
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,865
Temperature's falling because
it's not a closed system,

626
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:03,413
it's an open system.

627
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:07,163
As the air expands, the
density falls, right?

628
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:12,329
The energy per cubic, whatever, falls,

629
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,375
and therefore the
temperature falls, right?

630
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,263
The heat's falling outta the solution.

631
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,346
So when you're inflating,

632
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,835
let's say you're inflating
the currency supply by 6%,

633
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:30,251
you're sucking 6% of the
energy out of the fluid

634
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:35,120
that the economy is using to function.

635
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,729
- So the currency, this
kind of ocean of currency,

636
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:40,381
that's a nice way for
the economy to function.

637
00:32:40,381 --> 00:32:42,999
It's the most kind of,
it's being inefficient

638
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,784
when you expand the money supply,

639
00:32:44,784 --> 00:32:48,736
but it's the liquid, I'm trying to find

640
00:32:48,736 --> 00:32:51,171
the right kind of adjective here.

641
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:55,325
It's how you do transactions
at a scale of billions.

642
00:32:55,325 --> 00:32:57,030
- Currency is the asset we use

643
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,115
to move monetary energy around.

644
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:03,088
And you could use the dollar
or you could use the peso

645
00:33:03,088 --> 00:33:04,886
or you could use the bolivar.

646
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:08,750
- Selling houses and buying
houses is much more inefficient.

647
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,028
Or like you can't transact between

648
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:15,019
billions of people with houses.

649
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:19,259
- Yeah, properties don't make
such good mediums of exchange.

650
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:22,958
They make better stores of value
and they have utility value

651
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,717
if it's a ship or a house or a plane

652
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:28,967
or a bushel of corn, right?

653
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,294
- Can I zoom out just for-
- [Michael] Yeah.

654
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:32,404
- Can we zoom out, keep zooming out

655
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:35,279
until we reach the origin
of human civilization.

656
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,029
But on the way ask, you
gave economists a D-,

657
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,501
I'm not even gonna ask you
what you give to governments.

658
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,751
Do you think their failure,

659
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,974
economists' and government failure

660
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:51,557
is malevolence or incompetence?

661
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,696
- I think policy makers
are well intentioned,

662
00:33:56,696 --> 00:34:00,902
but generally all government
policy is inflationary

663
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:04,008
and all government, it's
inflammatory and inflationary.

664
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,914
So what I mean by that
is when you have a policy

665
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,831
pursuing supply chain independence,

666
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:15,697
if you have an energy policy,
if you have a labor policy,

667
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:19,348
if you have a trade policy,
if you have any kind

668
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,432
of foreign policy, a domestic policy,

669
00:34:23,342 --> 00:34:26,759
a manufacturing policy, a medical policy,

670
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,517
every one of these policies
interferes with the free market

671
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:36,016
and generally prevents some rational actor

672
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:40,493
from doing it in a cheaper,
more efficient way.

673
00:34:40,494 --> 00:34:43,537
So when you layer them
on top of each other,

674
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,244
they all have to be paid for.

675
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,268
If you want to shut down the
entire economy for a year,

676
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:49,786
you have to pay for it, right?

677
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:52,942
If you wanna fight a war, you
have to pay for it, right?

678
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:55,852
If you don't want to
use oil or natural gas,

679
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,312
you have to pay for it.

680
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:00,972
If you don't wanna manufacture
semiconductors in China

681
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:02,869
and you want to
manufacture them in the US,

682
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:03,717
you gotta pay for it.

683
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:06,771
If I rebuild the entire
supply chain in Pennsylvania

684
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,054
and I hire a bunch of employees

685
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:11,827
and then I unionize the employees,

686
00:35:11,827 --> 00:35:16,827
then not only am I idle the
factory in the far east,

687
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:18,628
it goes to 50% capacity,

688
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:22,367
so whatever it sells, it
has to raise the price on.

689
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,047
And then I drive up the cost of labor

690
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:27,068
for every other manufacturer in the US

691
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:30,435
because I competing against them, right?

692
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:31,695
I'm changing their condition.

693
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,739
So everything gets less efficient,

694
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,378
everything gets more expensive.

695
00:35:35,378 --> 00:35:37,509
And of course the government couldn't pay

696
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:40,925
for its policies and its wars with taxes.

697
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,808
We didn't pay for World War I with tax,

698
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,435
we didn't pay for World War II with tax,

699
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:48,034
we didn't pay for Vietnam with tax.

700
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,063
In fact, when you trace this,

701
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,556
what you realize is the government

702
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,842
never pays for all of
its policies with tax.

703
00:35:53,842 --> 00:35:54,675
It pays for-

704
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:57,862
- Because it's too painful
to ask to raise the taxes

705
00:35:57,862 --> 00:36:01,856
to truly transparently pay
for the things you're doing

706
00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:05,427
with taxes with taxpayer money,
'cause they feel the pain.

707
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:06,605
- Either that's one interpretation

708
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:09,001
or it's just too transparent.

709
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,637
If people understood the true cost-

710
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,975
- Of war.

711
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,230
They wouldn't want to go to war.

712
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,230
- If you were told that you
would lose 95% of your assets,

713
00:36:22,043 --> 00:36:24,255
and 90% of everything you will be ever

714
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:29,108
will be taken from you, you
might reprioritize your thought

715
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:31,141
about a given policy
and you might not vote

716
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:32,414
for that politician.

717
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:36,134
- But you're still saying
incompetence not malevolence.

718
00:36:36,134 --> 00:36:39,193
So fundamentally, government
creates a bureaucracy

719
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:42,612
of incompetence is kind
of how you look at it.

720
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:45,897
- I think a lack of humility, right?

721
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:50,731
Like, if people had more
humility than they would realize-

722
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:54,372
- Humility about how little they know,

723
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,207
how little they understand about

724
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,539
the function of complex systems.

725
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,075
- It's a phrase from Clint
Eastwood's movie, "Unforgiven,"

726
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,208
where he says, "A man's
gotta know his limitations."

727
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:04,528
(Lex chuckles)

728
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:07,976
I think that a lot of people overestimate

729
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,893
what they can accomplish
and experience in life

730
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:15,777
causes you to reevaluate that.

731
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:21,521
So, I mean I've done a
lot of things in my life

732
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:25,606
and generally my mistakes
were always my good ideas

733
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:28,809
that I enthusiastically
pursued to the detriment

734
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:32,226
of my great ideas that required 150%

735
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,615
of my attention to prosper.

736
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:40,130
So I think people pursue
too many good ideas

737
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,173
and they all sound good,
but there's just a limit

738
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:45,422
to what you can accomplish.

739
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:49,854
And everybody underestimates
the challenges

740
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:52,436
of implementing an idea, right?

741
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,912
And they always overestimate

742
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:58,862
the benefits of the pursuit of that.

743
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,466
And so I think it's an overconfidence

744
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:05,613
that causes an overexuberance
in pursuit of policies.

745
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:09,591
And as the ambition of
the government expands,

746
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:12,384
so must the currency supply.

747
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,581
Well, I could say the money supply,

748
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:17,788
but let's say the currency supply.

749
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:20,894
You can triple the number
of pesos in the economy,

750
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:23,150
but it doesn't triple the amount

751
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,780
of manufacturing capacity
in the said economy.

752
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,172
And it doesn't triple the
amount of assets in the economy.

753
00:38:30,172 --> 00:38:31,550
It just triples the pesos.

754
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,800
So as you increase the currency supply,

755
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:39,845
then the price of all those
scarce desirable things

756
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:42,903
will tend to go up rapidly.

757
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:47,478
And the confidence of
all of the institutions,

758
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:50,518
the corporations and the individual actors

759
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,850
and trading partners will collapse.

760
00:38:53,851 --> 00:38:57,115
- If we take a tangent on a
tangent, and we will return

761
00:38:57,115 --> 00:39:00,782
soon to the big human
civilization question.

762
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,705
So if government naturally wants

763
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,123
to buy stuff it can't afford,

764
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,963
what's the best form of government?

765
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,130
Anarchism, libertarianism.

766
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:22,155
There's not even armies,
there's no borders.

767
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:23,176
That's anarchism.

768
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:26,047
- [Michael] The least. (chuckles)

769
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,856
- The smallest possible.

770
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:29,829
- The best government would be the least.

771
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:32,472
And the debate will be over that.

772
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:34,710
- When you think about this
stuff, do you think about,

773
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,455
okay, government is the way it is,

774
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:40,101
I as a person that can
generate great ideas,

775
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,852
how do I operate in this world?

776
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,589
Or do you also think
about the big picture?

777
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,792
If we start a new civilization
somewhere on Mars,

778
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:51,409
do you think about what's the
ultimate form of government?

779
00:39:51,409 --> 00:39:54,826
What's at least a promising thing to try?

780
00:40:02,268 --> 00:40:05,469
- I have laser eyes on my
profile on Twitter, Lex.

781
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,144
- [Lex] Yes, I noticed.

782
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:07,976
What does that mean?

783
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:10,368
- And the significance of laser eyes

784
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:14,132
is to focus on the thing
that can make a difference.

785
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:14,965
- [Lex] Yes.

786
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:17,965
- And if I look at the civilization,

787
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:22,976
I would say half the
problems in the civilization

788
00:40:26,081 --> 00:40:28,113
are due to the fact that our understanding

789
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:30,886
of economics and money is defective.

790
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,747
Half, 50%.

791
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:35,795
I don't know, it's worth $500
trillion worth of problems.

792
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:39,545
Like money represents
all the economic energy

793
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,310
and the civilization
and it kind of equates

794
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:47,952
to all the products, all the
services and all the assets

795
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:50,010
that we have and wherever
we're gonna have.

796
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,113
So, that's half.

797
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:53,933
The other half of the
problems in the civilization

798
00:40:53,934 --> 00:40:57,101
are medical and military and political

799
00:41:00,364 --> 00:41:02,864
and philosophical and natural.

800
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:08,112
And I think that there are a lot

801
00:41:08,112 --> 00:41:12,194
of different solutions
to all those problems.

802
00:41:12,195 --> 00:41:15,362
And they are all honorable professions

803
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,280
and they all merit a
lifetime of consideration

804
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,889
for the specialist in all those areas.

805
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:28,222
I think that what I could
offer it's constructive is

806
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:33,448
inflation is completely misunderstood.

807
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,545
It's a much bigger problem
than we understand it to be.

808
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:39,081
We need to introduce engineering

809
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:41,710
and science techniques into economics

810
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,859
if we wanna further the human condition.

811
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,347
All government policy is inflationary.

812
00:41:48,347 --> 00:41:52,034
And another pernicious myth is inflation

813
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:55,875
is always and everywhere
a monetary phenomena.

814
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,126
So, a famous quote by
Milton Friedman, I believe.

815
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:00,886
It's like, "It's a monetary phenomena."

816
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,320
That is inflation comes from
expanding the currency supply.

817
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,734
It's a nice phrase and
it's oftentimes quoted

818
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,442
by people that are anti inflation.

819
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,248
But again, it just signifies
a lack of appreciation

820
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:15,057
of what the issue is.

821
00:42:15,056 --> 00:42:16,456
Inflation is.

822
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:21,456
If I had a currency which was
completely non-inflationary,

823
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,672
if I never printed another dollar

824
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:26,519
and if I eliminated
fractional reserve banking

825
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:30,110
from the face of the earth,
we'd still have inflation.

826
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:34,170
And we'd have inflation as
long as we have government

827
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,170
that is capable of pursuing
any kind of policies

828
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:42,333
that are in them self inflationary.

829
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,794
And generally they all are.

830
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:48,795
- So in general, inflationary
is the big characteristic

831
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:52,438
of human nature that
governments, collection of groups

832
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:54,384
that have power over others and allocate

833
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,552
other people's resources
will try to intentionally

834
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:03,550
or not hide the costs of those allocations

835
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,237
like in some tricky ways.

836
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:08,599
Whatever the options ever available.

837
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,697
- Hiding the cost is
like the tertiary thing.

838
00:43:12,697 --> 00:43:15,715
Like the primary goal is the government

839
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:18,721
will attempt to do good, right?

840
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,923
- [Lex] And that's the primary problem.

841
00:43:21,922 --> 00:43:23,927
- They will attempt to do good

842
00:43:23,927 --> 00:43:25,824
and they will do good imperfectly

843
00:43:25,824 --> 00:43:29,741
and they will create
oftentimes as much damage,

844
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,041
more damage than the good they do.

845
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,151
Most government policy will be iatrogenic,

846
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,453
it will create more harm than
good in the pursuit of it,

847
00:43:38,454 --> 00:43:40,204
but it is what it is.

848
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:47,210
The secondary issue is they
will unintentionally pay for it

849
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:52,038
by expanding the currency
supply without realizing

850
00:43:52,038 --> 00:43:57,038
that they're actually paying
for it in a suboptimal fashion.

851
00:43:59,717 --> 00:44:01,260
They'll collapse their own currencies

852
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,891
while they attempt to do good.

853
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:06,396
The tertiary issue is they will mismeasure

854
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:09,931
how badly they're collapsing the currency.

855
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:13,773
So for example, if you go to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

856
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:17,052
and look at the numbers printed
by the Fed, they'll say,

857
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:19,650
"Oh, it looks like the dollars lost 95%

858
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,834
of its purchasing power
over a hundred years."

859
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,870
Okay, they sort of fess
up there's a problem,

860
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,148
but they make it 95% loss
over a hundred years.

861
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:30,503
What they don't do is realize

862
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:33,586
it's a 99.7% loss over 80 years,

863
00:44:34,429 --> 00:44:38,025
so they will mismeasure
just the horrific extent

864
00:44:38,025 --> 00:44:40,775
of the monetary policy in pursuit

865
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:46,291
of the foreign policy
and the domestic policy,

866
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,291
which they overestimate their budget

867
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:54,239
and their means to accomplish their ends

868
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:56,822
and they underestimate the cost

869
00:44:57,731 --> 00:45:01,831
and they're oblivious
to the horrific damage

870
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,193
that they do to the civilization

871
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:06,987
because the mental models that they use

872
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:10,704
that are conventionally
taught are wrong, right?

873
00:45:10,704 --> 00:45:13,668
The mental model that like, it's okay,

874
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:14,868
we can print all this money

875
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:19,059
because the velocity of
the money is low, right?

876
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:21,562
Because money velocity is a scaler

877
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:23,536
and inflation is the scaler

878
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:25,791
and we don't see 2% inflation yet,

879
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:26,963
and the money velocity is low,

880
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:30,210
and so it's okay if we
print trillions of dollars.

881
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:34,434
Well, the money velocity
was immediate, right?

882
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:38,489
The velocity of money
through the crypto economy

883
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:42,630
is 10,000 times faster
than the velocity of money

884
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,990
through the consumer economy, right?

885
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,153
I think Nick pointed out
when you spoke to him,

886
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:49,842
he said it takes two months

887
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:52,875
for a credit card
transaction to settle, right?

888
00:45:52,876 --> 00:45:54,742
So you wanna spend a million dollars

889
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:59,555
in the consumer economy, you
can move it six times a year.

890
00:45:59,554 --> 00:46:01,568
You put a million dollars into gold,

891
00:46:01,568 --> 00:46:04,244
gold will sit in a vault for a decade.

892
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:08,434
Okay, so the velocity of
money through gold is 0.1.

893
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:10,166
You put the money in the stock market

894
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,885
and you can trade it once a week.

895
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:13,309
The settlement is t plus two.

896
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:15,418
Maybe you get to two to one leverage.

897
00:46:15,418 --> 00:46:16,987
You might get to a money velocity

898
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:20,576
of a hundred a year in the stock market.

899
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:23,063
You put your money into the crypto economy

900
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:26,192
and these people are
settling every four hours.

901
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:30,378
And if you're offshore, they're
trading with 20X leverage.

902
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:35,018
So if you settle every day and
you trade with 20X leverage,

903
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:38,097
you just went to 7,000.
- [Lex] Yeah.

904
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:41,264
- So the velocity of the money varies.

905
00:46:42,945 --> 00:46:44,262
I think the politicians,

906
00:46:44,262 --> 00:46:46,519
they don't really understand inflation

907
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,690
and they don't understand economic.

908
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,902
But you can't blame 'em

909
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,951
because the economists
don't understand economics

910
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:56,713
because if they did,
they would be creating

911
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,546
multi-variate computer simulations

912
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:03,442
where they actually put in the price

913
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:06,940
of every piece of housing
in every city in the world,

914
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,974
the full array of foods and
the full array of products

915
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:12,117
and the full array of assets.

916
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:14,367
And then on a monthly basis

917
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:18,105
they would publish all those results.

918
00:47:18,106 --> 00:47:21,439
And that's a high bandwidth requirement.

919
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,517
And I think that people don't
really wanna embrace it.

920
00:47:25,516 --> 00:47:29,386
And also there's the
most pernicious thing.

921
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:31,426
Like there's that phrase, you know,

922
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,815
"You can't tell people what to think,

923
00:47:33,815 --> 00:47:35,657
but you can tell 'em what to think about."

924
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:39,185
The most pernicious thing is I get you

925
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:41,769
to misunderstand the phenomena,

926
00:47:42,891 --> 00:47:47,023
so that even when it's happening to you,

927
00:47:47,023 --> 00:47:49,273
you don't appreciate that it's a bad thing

928
00:47:49,273 --> 00:47:50,873
and you think it's a good thing.

929
00:47:50,873 --> 00:47:54,228
So if housing prices are
going up 20% year over year,

930
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:56,416
and I say this is great
for the American public

931
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:58,920
'cause most of 'em are homeowners,

932
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,447
then I have misrepresented a phenomena,

933
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:06,167
inflation is 20%, not 7%.

934
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:08,304
And then I have misrepresented it

935
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:12,282
as being a positive
rather than a negative.

936
00:48:12,282 --> 00:48:13,640
And people will stare at it

937
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:17,942
and you could even show
them their house on fire

938
00:48:17,943 --> 00:48:19,441
and they would perceive it as being great

939
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,364
because it's warming them up

940
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:23,422
and they're gonna save on their heat cost.

941
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:26,163
- It does seem that the
cruder of the model,

942
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:29,390
whether it's economics,
whether it's psychology,

943
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:31,221
the easier it is to weave

944
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:33,872
whatever the heck narrative you want.

945
00:48:33,871 --> 00:48:35,803
And not in a malicious way,

946
00:48:35,804 --> 00:48:40,471
but just like it's some kind
of like emergent phenomena,

947
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,125
this narrative thing that
would tell ourselves.

948
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,672
So you can tell any kind
of story about inflation.

949
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:47,845
Inflation is good, inflation is bad.

950
00:48:47,846 --> 00:48:49,282
Like the crude of the model,

951
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:53,093
the easier just to tell
a narrative about it.

952
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:56,967
So like if you take an
engineering approach,

953
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,938
I feel like it's becomes
more and more difficult

954
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:03,111
to run away from sort of
a true deep understanding

955
00:49:03,112 --> 00:49:05,612
of the dynamics of the system.

956
00:49:06,963 --> 00:49:08,127
- I mean, honestly, if you went

957
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,581
to a hundred people on the street

958
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:12,277
and you asked them to define inflation,

959
00:49:12,277 --> 00:49:15,019
how many would say it's a vector

960
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,353
tracking the change in price

961
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:22,585
of every product service
asset in the world over time?

962
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:23,583
- [Lex] No.
- Not many.

963
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:24,585
- [Lex] Not many.

964
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:27,807
- Now if you went to them and you said,

965
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,251
do you think 2% inflation
a year is good or bad?

966
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:33,564
The majority would probably say,

967
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,123
"Well, here it's good."
- Yeah.

968
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:36,462
- The majority of economists

969
00:49:36,463 --> 00:49:40,434
would say 2% inflation a year is good.

970
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:43,586
And of course there's look
at the ship next to us.

971
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:48,168
What if I told you that
the ship leaked 2%, right,

972
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:52,643
of its volume every something, right?

973
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:54,893
The ship is rotting 2% a year.

974
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:57,436
That means the useful life
of the ship is 50 years.

975
00:49:57,436 --> 00:49:59,029
Now, ironically, that's true.

976
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,981
Like a wooden ship had a 50
year to a hundred year life.

977
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:05,104
A hundred would be long,
50 years not unlikely.

978
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:07,727
So when we built ships outta wood,

979
00:50:07,728 --> 00:50:11,121
they had a useful life of about 50 years

980
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:13,056
and then they sunk, they rotted.

981
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:15,692
There's nothing good about it, right?

982
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:17,681
You build a ship out of steel,

983
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:22,195
and it's zero as opposed
to 2% degradation.

984
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:25,872
And how much better is 0% versus 2%?

985
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:29,873
Well, 2% means you have a
useful life of, you know,

986
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:32,123
it's half life of 35 years.

987
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,517
2% is a half life of 35 years.

988
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:38,103
That's basically the half
life of money and gold.

989
00:50:38,103 --> 00:50:40,768
If I store your life force in gold,

990
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:42,534
under perfect circumstances,

991
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:45,376
you have a useful life of 35 years.

992
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,585
0% is a useful life of forever.

993
00:50:48,585 --> 00:50:51,186
So 0% is immortal,

994
00:50:51,186 --> 00:50:54,853
2% is 35 years average life expectancy.

995
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:58,176
So, the idea that you would think

996
00:50:58,177 --> 00:51:00,728
the life expectancy of the currency

997
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:03,079
and the civilization should be 35 years

998
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:05,909
instead of forever is
kind of a silly notion.

999
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:10,742
But the tragic notion is it
was seven into 70 or 10 years.

1000
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:15,614
It's the money has had
a half life of 10 years

1001
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:20,614
except for the fact that in
weak societies and in Argentina

1002
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:22,654
or the like, the half life of the money

1003
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:26,992
is three to four years,
in Venezuela one year.

1004
00:51:26,992 --> 00:51:29,590
So the United States dollar

1005
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,923
and the United States economic system

1006
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:35,454
was the most successful economic system

1007
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,545
in the last a hundred years in the world.

1008
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:40,673
We won every war, we were
the world superpower.

1009
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:44,103
Our currency lost 99.7% of its value.

1010
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:45,847
And that means horrifically

1011
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:48,931
every other currency lost everything.

1012
00:51:50,518 --> 00:51:53,449
In essence, the other ones were 99.9,

1013
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,523
except for most that were 100%

1014
00:51:55,523 --> 00:51:58,594
because they all completely failed.

1015
00:51:58,594 --> 00:52:03,155
And you've got a mainstream
economic community

1016
00:52:03,155 --> 00:52:08,155
that thinks that inflation is
a number and 2% is desirable.

1017
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:15,844
It's kind of like, you know,
remember George Washington,

1018
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:16,964
you know how he died?

1019
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:17,882
- [Lex] No.

1020
00:52:18,983 --> 00:52:21,774
- Well-meaning physicians
bled him to death.

1021
00:52:21,773 --> 00:52:23,569
- [Lex] Hmm.

1022
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,403
- Okay.

1023
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:26,423
The last thing in the
world you would want to do

1024
00:52:26,423 --> 00:52:30,320
to a sick person is bleed them, right?

1025
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,914
In the modern world, I think we understand

1026
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:35,414
that oxygen is carried by the blood cells.

1027
00:52:40,114 --> 00:52:42,364
There's that phrase, right?

1028
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:44,557
Triage phrase.

1029
00:52:44,557 --> 00:52:47,317
What's the first thing
you do in an injury?

1030
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:48,974
Stop the bleeding.

1031
00:52:48,974 --> 00:52:50,318
Single first thing, right?

1032
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:52,704
You show up after any
accident, I look at you,

1033
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:55,122
stop the bleeding, because
you're gonna be dead

1034
00:52:55,121 --> 00:52:58,224
in a matter of minutes if you bleed out.

1035
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:01,353
So, it strikes me as being ironic

1036
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,590
that orthodox conventional wisdom

1037
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,773
was bleed the patient to death.

1038
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:09,361
And this was the most important
patient in the country,

1039
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,301
maybe in the history of the country.

1040
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:14,510
And we bled him to death
trying to help him.

1041
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:19,489
So when you're actually
inflating the money supply at 7%,

1042
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:21,226
but you're calling it 2%

1043
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:23,365
because you want to help the economy,

1044
00:53:23,365 --> 00:53:27,615
you're literally bleeding
the free market to death.

1045
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:32,360
But the sad fact is George
Washington went along with it

1046
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,030
'cause he thought that they
were gonna do him good.

1047
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:39,030
And the majority of the
society, most companies,

1048
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:44,442
most conventional thinkers,
the working class,

1049
00:53:45,539 --> 00:53:47,895
they go along with this because they think

1050
00:53:47,894 --> 00:53:51,061
that someone has their
best interest in mind.

1051
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,193
And the people that are
bleeding them to death believe,

1052
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,479
they believe that prescription

1053
00:53:56,478 --> 00:53:59,114
because their mental models
are just so defective.

1054
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:03,114
And then understanding
of energy and engineering

1055
00:54:05,644 --> 00:54:08,632
and the economics that are at play

1056
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:12,009
is crippled by these mental models.

1057
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:13,728
- But that's both the bug in the future

1058
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:16,784
of human civilization
that ideas take hold.

1059
00:54:16,784 --> 00:54:19,650
They unite us, we believe in them,

1060
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,900
and we make a lot of cool stuff happen.

1061
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:29,324
By as an average sort of
just the fact of the matter,

1062
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,072
a lot of people believe the same thing.

1063
00:54:32,072 --> 00:54:34,411
They get together and
they get some shit done

1064
00:54:34,411 --> 00:54:36,365
because they believe that thing.

1065
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:39,034
And then some ideas can be really bad

1066
00:54:39,034 --> 00:54:40,815
and really destructive.

1067
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:43,851
But on average, the ideas
seem to be progressing

1068
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:45,530
in a direction of good.

1069
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,701
Let me just step back.

1070
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:49,303
What the hell are we doing here?

1071
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:51,382
Us humans on this earth.

1072
00:54:51,382 --> 00:54:53,155
How do you think of humans?

1073
00:54:53,155 --> 00:54:54,985
How special are humans?

1074
00:54:54,985 --> 00:54:59,716
How did human civilization
originate on this earth?

1075
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:03,426
And what is this human project
they we're all taking on?

1076
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:06,188
You mentioned fire and water

1077
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:09,067
and apparently bleeding you
to death is not a good idea.

1078
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,766
I always thought you can get
the demons out in that way,

1079
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,860
but that was a recent invention.

1080
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,110
So, what's this thing we're doing here?

1081
00:55:20,557 --> 00:55:23,141
- I think what distinguishes human beings

1082
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:26,558
from all the other creatures on the earth

1083
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,657
is our ability to engineer.

1084
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,317
We're engineers, right?

1085
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:37,067
- To solve problems or just
build incredible cool things?

1086
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:42,606
- Engineering, harnessing
energy and technique

1087
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:46,628
to make the world a better
place than you found it.

1088
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:49,331
Right, from the point
that we actually started

1089
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:51,539
to play with fire, right?

1090
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:53,873
That was a big leap forward.

1091
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:58,773
Harnessing the power of
kinetic energy and missiles,

1092
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,523
another step forward.

1093
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,595
Every city built on water.

1094
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:05,834
Why water?

1095
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:09,724
Well, water's bringing energy, right?

1096
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:13,057
If you actually put a turbine on a river

1097
00:56:14,603 --> 00:56:17,318
or you capture a change
in elevation of water,

1098
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:20,405
you've literally harnessed
gravitational energy.

1099
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:22,212
But water's also bringing you food.

1100
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,963
It's also giving you a cheap form

1101
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:28,211
of getting rid of your waste.

1102
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:30,768
It's also giving you free transportation.

1103
00:56:30,768 --> 00:56:32,791
You wanna move one ton blocks around,

1104
00:56:32,791 --> 00:56:34,796
you want to move them in water.

1105
00:56:34,795 --> 00:56:37,628
So I think, I mean the human story

1106
00:56:38,744 --> 00:56:42,911
is really the story of
engineering a better world.

1107
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,629
And the rise in the human condition

1108
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,896
is determined by those groups of people,

1109
00:56:50,896 --> 00:56:55,651
those civilizations that were
best at harnessing energy.

1110
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,753
Right, if you look, you
know, the Greek civilization,

1111
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:01,711
they built it around ports and sea ports

1112
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:04,880
and water and created a trading network.

1113
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,422
The Romans were really good

1114
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:10,101
at harnessing all sorts of engineering.

1115
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:13,407
I mean, the aqueducts are a great example.

1116
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:15,309
If you go to any big city,

1117
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:16,782
you travel through cities in the Med,

1118
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:19,817
you find that the carrying
capacity of the city

1119
00:57:19,817 --> 00:57:23,166
or the island is 5,000
people without running water.

1120
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:25,702
And then if you can find
a way to bring water to it

1121
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:28,036
increases by a factor of 10.

1122
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:31,661
And so human flourishing
is really only possible

1123
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:35,563
through that channeling of energy, right?

1124
00:57:35,563 --> 00:57:39,813
That eventually takes the
form of air power, right?

1125
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:45,542
I mean that ship, I mean,
look at the intricacy

1126
00:57:45,543 --> 00:57:47,199
of those sails, right?

1127
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,610
I mean, it's just the model is intricate.

1128
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:52,474
Now think about all of the
experimentation that took place

1129
00:57:52,474 --> 00:57:54,708
to figure out how many
sails to put on that ship

1130
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,097
and how to rig them and how to repair them

1131
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:59,097
and how to operate them.

1132
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:03,097
- There's thousands of lives spent

1133
00:58:03,097 --> 00:58:05,885
thinking through all
the tiny little details

1134
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:10,885
all to increase the efficiency
of this, the effectiveness,

1135
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,009
the efficiency of this
ship as it sails to water.

1136
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:16,417
And we should also note
that there's a bunch

1137
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,681
of cannons on the side.

1138
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:18,514
So obviously-

1139
00:58:18,514 --> 00:58:20,900
- Another form of engineering, right?

1140
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,132
Energy harnessing with explosives.

1141
00:58:24,132 --> 00:58:25,275
- To achieve what end.

1142
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:27,517
That's another discussion, exactly.

1143
00:58:27,516 --> 00:58:28,543
- [Michael] Suppose we're trying

1144
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:30,445
to get off the planet, right?

1145
00:58:30,445 --> 00:58:32,730
- Well, there's a selection
mechanism going on.

1146
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,846
So natural selection, this whatever,

1147
00:58:34,846 --> 00:58:37,306
however evolution works, it seems that one

1148
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,169
of the interesting inventions on earth

1149
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:42,443
was the predator-prey dynamic,

1150
00:58:42,443 --> 00:58:45,422
that you want to be the bigger fish.

1151
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:48,980
That violence seems to
serve a useful purpose

1152
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,487
if you look at earth as a whole.

1153
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:54,399
We as humans now like to think of violence

1154
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,371
as really a bad thing.

1155
00:58:56,371 --> 00:58:59,208
It seems to be one of the
amazing things about humans

1156
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,434
is we're ultimately tend
towards cooperation.

1157
00:59:02,434 --> 00:59:04,601
We want to, we like peace.

1158
00:59:05,487 --> 00:59:07,677
If you just look at
history, we want things

1159
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:11,260
to be nice and calm
but just wars break out

1160
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:16,561
every once in a while and
lead to immense suffering

1161
00:59:16,561 --> 00:59:18,364
and destruction and so on.

1162
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:23,114
And they have a kind of like
resetting the palate effect.

1163
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:31,411
It's one that's full of just
immeasurable human suffering.

1164
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:34,541
But it's like a way to start over.

1165
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:38,141
- We're clearly the apex
predator on the planet.

1166
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,748
And I googled something the other day,

1167
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:45,414
what's the most common form
of mammal life on the earth?

1168
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,476
- By number of organisms?
- [Michael] Count.

1169
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:50,309
- By count.

1170
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:53,066
- And the answer that came
back was human beings.

1171
00:59:53,065 --> 00:59:53,898
I was shocked.

1172
00:59:53,898 --> 00:59:54,931
I couldn't believe it, right?

1173
00:59:54,931 --> 00:59:57,759
It says like apparently if
we're just looking at mammals,

1174
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,888
the answer was human
beings are the most common.

1175
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,697
Which was very interesting to me.

1176
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:05,222
I almost didn't believe
it, but I was trying to,

1177
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:07,271
you know, 8 billion or so human beings.

1178
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,105
- Yeah, it's a lot.

1179
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,867
- There's no other mammal
that's got more than 8 billion.

1180
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:13,499
If you walk through downtown
Edinburgh and Scotland,

1181
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:14,757
and you look up on this hill

1182
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:17,213
and there's castle up on the hill,

1183
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:21,154
and you talk to people and the story is,

1184
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:24,073
"Oh yeah, well, that was
a British castle before.

1185
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:26,778
It was a Scottish castle
before it was a pick castle,

1186
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:28,217
before it was a Roman castle,

1187
01:00:28,217 --> 01:00:33,023
before it was some other
Celtic castle before it was a."

1188
01:00:33,023 --> 01:00:35,962
Then they found 13 prehistoric castles

1189
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:38,807
buried one under the other.

1190
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:41,253
And you get the conclusion

1191
01:00:41,253 --> 01:00:43,828
that a hundred thousand
years ago, somebody showed up

1192
01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:48,519
and grabbed the high point,
the apex of the city,

1193
01:00:48,518 --> 01:00:50,865
and they built a stronghold there

1194
01:00:50,865 --> 01:00:52,900
and they flourished and
their family flourished

1195
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,777
and their tribe flourished
until someone came along

1196
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,848
and knocked him off the hill.

1197
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:00,620
And it's been a nonstop never ending fight

1198
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:04,619
by the aggressive, most
powerful entity, family,

1199
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:09,168
organization, municipality,
tribe, whatever.

1200
01:01:09,168 --> 01:01:10,201
- [Lex] Off the hill.

1201
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:15,184
- For that one hill going
back since time in memorial.

1202
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:18,518
And you scratch your head and you think,

1203
01:01:20,425 --> 01:01:24,832
"It seems like it's like just
this never ending wheel."

1204
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:27,877
- But does not lead if you
just all kinds of metrics

1205
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:30,521
that seems to improve the quality

1206
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,634
of our cannons and ships as a result.

1207
01:01:33,635 --> 01:01:37,149
Like it seems that just
like your laser eyes

1208
01:01:37,148 --> 01:01:39,951
focuses the mind on the engineering tasks.

1209
01:01:39,952 --> 01:01:43,639
- It is that, and it does remind you

1210
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:47,306
that the winner is
always the most powerful.

1211
01:01:49,264 --> 01:01:51,449
And we throw that phrase out,

1212
01:01:51,449 --> 01:01:53,713
but no one thinks about
what that phrase means.

1213
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:58,713
Like who's the most powerful
or the most powerful side won,

1214
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:02,385
but they don't think about it
and they think about power,

1215
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,661
energy delivered in a period of time.

1216
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:08,702
And then you think a guy with a spear

1217
01:02:08,702 --> 01:02:11,259
is more powerful than
someone with their fist

1218
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,163
and someone with a bow
and arrow is more powerful

1219
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,981
than the person with the spear.

1220
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,763
And then you realize
that somebody with bronze

1221
01:02:17,762 --> 01:02:19,529
is more powerful than without,

1222
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:21,986
and steel is more powerful than bronze.

1223
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:23,525
And if you look at the Romans,

1224
01:02:23,525 --> 01:02:26,309
they persevered with artillery

1225
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:29,161
and they could stand off from 800 meters

1226
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:31,679
and blast you to smithereens, right?

1227
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,172
You study the history of the
Balearic slingers, right?

1228
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,163
And you think we invented bullets,

1229
01:02:38,163 --> 01:02:40,938
but they invented bullets to put in slings

1230
01:02:40,938 --> 01:02:45,442
thousands of years ago that
could have stood off 500 meters

1231
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:47,600
and put a hole in your head, right?

1232
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:52,266
And so there was never a time
when humanity wasn't vying

1233
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:59,412
to come up with an asymmetric form

1234
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:03,091
of projecting their own
power via technology.

1235
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:05,646
- An absolute power is
when a leader is able

1236
01:03:05,646 --> 01:03:08,480
to control large amount of humans,

1237
01:03:10,784 --> 01:03:13,652
they're facing the same direction,

1238
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:17,813
working in the same
direction to leverage energy.

1239
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:20,385
- The most organized society wins.

1240
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:21,219
- [Lex] Yeah.

1241
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:24,572
- When the Romans were
dominating everybody,

1242
01:03:24,572 --> 01:03:28,909
they were the most organized
civilization in Europe.

1243
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,970
And as long as they stayed
organized, they dominated.

1244
01:03:31,969 --> 01:03:34,155
And at some point they over expanded

1245
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:37,489
and got disorganized and they collapsed.

1246
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:39,942
And I guess you could say

1247
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:42,375
that the struggle of human condition,

1248
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,666
it catalyzes the development
of new technologies

1249
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:46,826
one after the other.

1250
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:51,244
It penalizes anybody that
rejects ocean power, right?

1251
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:53,527
Gets penalized.

1252
01:03:53,527 --> 01:03:55,396
You reject artillery, you get penalized.

1253
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:58,452
You reject atomic power,
you get penalized.

1254
01:03:58,452 --> 01:04:03,452
If you reject digital power,
cyber power, you get penalized.

1255
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:07,641
And the underlying control of the property

1256
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:11,058
keeps shifting hands from one institution

1257
01:04:12,485 --> 01:04:14,510
or one government to another based upon

1258
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:18,101
how rationally they're
able to channel that energy

1259
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:21,146
and how well organized
or coordinated they are.

1260
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:22,701
- Well, that's really
interesting thing about

1261
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:26,356
both the human mind and
governments that they,

1262
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:27,762
once they get a few good and companies,

1263
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:29,482
once they get a few good ideas,

1264
01:04:29,483 --> 01:04:31,784
they seem to stick with them.

1265
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:33,735
They reject new ideas.

1266
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:38,735
It's almost whether that's
emergent or however that evolved,

1267
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,519
it seems to have a
really interesting effect

1268
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,699
'cause when you're young,
you fight for the new ideas,

1269
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:47,076
you push them through.

1270
01:04:47,077 --> 01:04:50,760
Then a few of us humans find success,

1271
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,242
then we get complacent.

1272
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:56,132
We take over the world
using that new idea.

1273
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:59,235
And then the new young person

1274
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:03,039
with a better new idea challenges you.

1275
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,824
And you as opposed to pivoting,
you stick with the old,

1276
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:08,337
and lose because of it.

1277
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:09,995
And that's how empires collapse.

1278
01:05:09,994 --> 01:05:12,674
And it's just both at the
individual level that happens

1279
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,394
with two academics fighting about ideas

1280
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:15,860
or something like that.

1281
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,050
And at the human civilization
level, governments,

1282
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,293
they hold on to the ideas of old.

1283
01:05:23,293 --> 01:05:24,748
It's fascinating.

1284
01:05:24,748 --> 01:05:28,146
- Yeah, an ever persistent
theme in the history of science

1285
01:05:28,146 --> 01:05:31,355
is the paradigm shifts
and the paradigms shift

1286
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:35,193
when the old guard dies and
a new generation arrives,

1287
01:05:35,193 --> 01:05:39,307
or the paradigm shifts when there's a war.

1288
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:43,538
And everyone that disagrees
with the idea of aviation

1289
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,123
finds bombs dropping on
their head or everyone

1290
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,750
that disagrees with
whatever your technology is

1291
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,641
has a rude awakening.

1292
01:05:49,641 --> 01:05:53,609
And if they totally disagree,
they're society collapses

1293
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,860
and they're replaced by that new thing.

1294
01:05:57,708 --> 01:06:00,230
- A lot of the engineering
you talked about had to do

1295
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:04,492
with ships and cannons
and leveraging water.

1296
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:07,981
What about this whole digital
thing that's happening?

1297
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:11,064
Been happening over the past century.

1298
01:06:12,298 --> 01:06:14,923
Is that still engineering in your mind?

1299
01:06:14,923 --> 01:06:19,583
You're starting to operate
in these bits of information?

1300
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,119
- I think there's two big ideas.

1301
01:06:22,119 --> 01:06:26,019
The first wave of ideas
were digital information.

1302
01:06:26,019 --> 01:06:27,894
And that was the internet
wave been running

1303
01:06:27,894 --> 01:06:30,394
since 1990 or so for 30 years.

1304
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:34,993
And the second wave is digital energy.

1305
01:06:34,994 --> 01:06:37,879
So if I look at digital information,

1306
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:42,128
this idea that we wanna
digitally transform a book,

1307
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:48,380
I'm gonna dematerialize every
book in this room into bits,

1308
01:06:48,478 --> 01:06:50,725
and then I'm going to deliver a copy

1309
01:06:50,726 --> 01:06:53,780
of the entire library to a billion people.

1310
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:58,780
And I'm gonna do it for pretty
much de minimis electricity.

1311
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:02,623
If I can dematerialize music, books,

1312
01:07:02,623 --> 01:07:05,789
education, entertainment, maps, right?

1313
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:14,804
That is an incredibly like
exothermic transaction.

1314
01:07:14,804 --> 01:07:17,460
It's a crystallization when we collapse

1315
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,768
into a lower energy
state as a civilization

1316
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:23,119
and we give off massive amounts of energy.

1317
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,552
Like if you look at what Carnegie did,

1318
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:26,363
the richest man in the
world created libraries

1319
01:07:26,362 --> 01:07:30,112
everywhere at the time, and he
gave away his entire fortune.

1320
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,821
And now we can give a better library

1321
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:35,106
to every 6-year-old for nothing.

1322
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:38,177
And so what's the value
of giving a million books

1323
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:41,399
to a 8 billion people, right?

1324
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:44,534
That's the explosion in prosperity

1325
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,976
that comes from digital transformation.

1326
01:07:46,976 --> 01:07:49,651
And when we do it with maps.

1327
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,934
I transform the map, I put it into a car.

1328
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:54,690
You get in the car and the car drives you

1329
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,273
where you want to go with the map, right?

1330
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:58,775
And how much better is that

1331
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:02,206
than a Rand McNally atlas right here?

1332
01:08:02,206 --> 01:08:04,028
It's like a million times better.

1333
01:08:04,028 --> 01:08:04,862
- [Lex] Yeah.

1334
01:08:04,862 --> 01:08:08,902
- So the first wave of
digital transformation

1335
01:08:08,902 --> 01:08:11,383
was the dematerialization of all

1336
01:08:11,382 --> 01:08:15,364
of these informational things,
which are non-conservative.

1337
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:17,771
That is I could take
Beethoven's, "Fifth Symphony,"

1338
01:08:17,771 --> 01:08:21,429
played for by the best
orchestra in Germany,

1339
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:23,244
and I could give it to a billion people

1340
01:08:23,244 --> 01:08:25,835
and they could play it
a thousand times each

1341
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:29,715
at less than the cost of
the one performance, right?

1342
01:08:29,715 --> 01:08:32,751
So I deliver culture and education

1343
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:35,764
in their edition and
intelligence and insight

1344
01:08:35,764 --> 01:08:39,097
to the entire civilization
over digital rails.

1345
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:41,363
And the consequences of the human race

1346
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:44,914
are first order generally good, right?

1347
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:46,355
The world is a better place.

1348
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,389
It drives growth and you create

1349
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,222
these trillion dollar
entities like Apple and Amazon

1350
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:52,972
and Facebook and Google
and Microsoft, right?

1351
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:57,322
That is the first wave.

1352
01:08:57,323 --> 01:08:58,652
The second wave-

1353
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:00,247
- Do you mind, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1354
01:09:00,247 --> 01:09:01,079
- [Michael] Yeah.

1355
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:04,079
- But that first wave, it feels like

1356
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:09,751
the impact that's positive,
you said the first order impact

1357
01:09:09,751 --> 01:09:11,047
is generally positive.

1358
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,552
It feels like it's positive in a way

1359
01:09:12,552 --> 01:09:15,667
that nothing else in
history has been positive.

1360
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:19,167
And then we may not actually truly be able

1361
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:25,237
to understand the orders
of magnitude of increase

1362
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:30,238
in productivity in just
progress and human civilization

1363
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:33,510
until we look back centuries from now.

1364
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,442
Just looking at the impact of Wikipedia,

1365
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:44,826
the giving access to basic
wisdom or basic knowledge

1366
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:48,652
and then perhaps wisdom
to billions of people.

1367
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:50,807
If you can just linger
on that for a second.

1368
01:09:50,807 --> 01:09:54,140
What's your sense of the impact of that?

1369
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,690
- I would say if you're a
technologist philosopher,

1370
01:10:04,065 --> 01:10:06,230
the impact of a technology

1371
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,082
is so much greater on the civilization

1372
01:10:09,082 --> 01:10:12,390
and the human condition
than a non-technology

1373
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,860
that is almost not worth
your trouble to bother

1374
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:17,692
trying to fix things a conventional way.

1375
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:20,390
So, let's take example.

1376
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:23,655
I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy

1377
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:27,603
and the Saylor Academy
gives away free education,

1378
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:31,573
free college education to
anybody on earth that wants it.

1379
01:10:31,573 --> 01:10:34,045
And we've had more than
a million students.

1380
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:37,184
And if you go and you
take the physics class,

1381
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:39,105
the lectures were by
the same physics lecture

1382
01:10:39,105 --> 01:10:43,814
that taught me physics at
MIT except when I was at MIT,

1383
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:47,296
the cost of the first four weeks of MIT

1384
01:10:47,296 --> 01:10:50,771
would've drained my family's
collective life savings

1385
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:52,369
for the first, last a hundred years.

1386
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:53,202
- [Lex] Yep. (chuckles)

1387
01:10:53,203 --> 01:10:55,804
- Like a hundred years worth of my father,

1388
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:57,310
my grandfather, my great-grandfather,

1389
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,807
they saved every penny they
had after a hundred years,

1390
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:02,801
they could have paid for one
week or two weeks of MIT.

1391
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:03,634
- [Lex] Yeah.

1392
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:06,283
- That's how fiendishly
expensive and inefficient it was.

1393
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:08,527
So, I went on scholarship.
- [Lex] Yes.

1394
01:11:08,528 --> 01:11:10,802
- I was lucky to have a scholarship.

1395
01:11:10,801 --> 01:11:12,988
But on the other hand,

1396
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:16,405
I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall

1397
01:11:17,354 --> 01:11:19,496
and I was like right up in the rafters.

1398
01:11:19,497 --> 01:11:21,364
It's an awful experience on these

1399
01:11:21,363 --> 01:11:23,562
like uncomfortable wooden benches

1400
01:11:23,563 --> 01:11:25,873
and you can barely see the blackboard

1401
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:28,718
and you gotta be there synchronously.

1402
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,858
And the stuff we upload,
you can start it and stop it

1403
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:34,887
and watch it on your iPad
or watch it on your computer

1404
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:38,292
and rewind it multiple times
and sit in a comfortable chair

1405
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,271
and you can do it from anywhere on earth.

1406
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:42,208
And it's absolutely free.

1407
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,773
So, I think about this and I think

1408
01:11:43,774 --> 01:11:46,542
you wanna improve the human condition.

1409
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:51,289
You need people with
postgraduate level education.

1410
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:54,748
You need PhDs, and I know
this sounds kind of elitist,

1411
01:11:54,748 --> 01:11:56,176
but you want to cure cancer

1412
01:11:56,176 --> 01:11:59,844
and you wanna go to the
stars, fusion drive.

1413
01:12:01,194 --> 01:12:03,616
We need new propulsion, right?

1414
01:12:03,617 --> 01:12:06,300
We need extraordinary breakthroughs

1415
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,882
in every area of basic science.

1416
01:12:10,798 --> 01:12:14,801
Be it biology or propulsion
or material science

1417
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,615
or computer science.

1418
01:12:16,614 --> 01:12:18,925
You're not doing that with
an undergraduate degree.

1419
01:12:18,926 --> 01:12:22,641
You're certainly not doing it
with a high school education.

1420
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,678
But the cost of a PhD
is like a million bucks.

1421
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,938
There's like 10 million PhDs in the world

1422
01:12:28,938 --> 01:12:29,893
if you check it out.

1423
01:12:29,893 --> 01:12:31,774
There's 8 billion people in the world.

1424
01:12:31,774 --> 01:12:35,169
How many people could get
a PhD or would want to?

1425
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:38,869
Maybe not 8 billion, but
a billion, 500 million.

1426
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:41,555
Let's just say 500 million to a billion.

1427
01:12:41,555 --> 01:12:43,119
How do you go from 10 million

1428
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,925
to a billion highly educated people,

1429
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:49,770
all of them specializing in,

1430
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:52,179
and I don't have to tell you
how many different fields

1431
01:12:52,179 --> 01:12:54,261
of human endeavor there are.

1432
01:12:54,261 --> 01:12:56,452
I mean, your life is
interviewing these experts.

1433
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:58,703
And there's so many, right?

1434
01:13:00,141 --> 01:13:02,398
You know, it's amazing.

1435
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,526
So how do I give a
multimillion dollar education

1436
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:08,119
to a billion people?

1437
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:10,270
And there's two choices.

1438
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,554
You can either endow a scholarship,

1439
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:15,637
in which case you pay $75,000 a year.

1440
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:20,746
Let's pay a million dollars
and a million dollars a person.

1441
01:13:20,746 --> 01:13:23,047
I can do it that way.

1442
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:27,701
And you're never, even if
you had a trillion dollars.

1443
01:13:27,701 --> 01:13:30,637
If you had $10 trillion
to throw at the problem

1444
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:33,813
and we've just thrown $10
trillion at certain problems.

1445
01:13:33,813 --> 01:13:34,699
- [Lex] Yeah.

1446
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:37,098
- You don't solve the problem, right?

1447
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:39,712
If I put $10 trillion
on the table and I said,

1448
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,275
"Educate everybody, give 'em all a PhD,"

1449
01:13:41,275 --> 01:13:42,740
you still wouldn't solve the problem.

1450
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:46,618
Harvard University can't
educate 18,000 people

1451
01:13:46,618 --> 01:13:50,786
simultaneously, or 87,000
or 800,000 or 8 million.

1452
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:54,376
So you have to dematerialize the professor

1453
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:56,538
and dematerialize the experience.

1454
01:13:56,538 --> 01:13:59,297
So you put it all as streaming on demand,

1455
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:01,506
computer generated education,

1456
01:14:01,506 --> 01:14:04,545
and you create simulations where you need

1457
01:14:04,546 --> 01:14:07,949
to create simulations and you upload it.

1458
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:11,948
It's like the human
condition is being held back

1459
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:16,031
by 500,000 well-meaning
average algebra teachers.

1460
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:21,339
(Lex chuckles)

1461
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,172
I love 'em.

1462
01:14:22,172 --> 01:14:23,225
I mean, please don't take of offense

1463
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:24,371
if you're an algebra teacher,

1464
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:27,587
but instead of 500,000 algebra teachers

1465
01:14:27,587 --> 01:14:31,220
going through the same
motion over and over again,

1466
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:34,680
what you need is like one or five

1467
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:37,164
or 10 really good algebra teachers

1468
01:14:37,163 --> 01:14:40,324
and they need to do it
a billion times a day

1469
01:14:40,324 --> 01:14:43,775
or a billion times a year for free.

1470
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:46,814
And if we do that, there's no reason

1471
01:14:46,814 --> 01:14:51,814
why you can't give infinite
education, certainly in science,

1472
01:14:52,381 --> 01:14:54,980
technology, engineering, and math, right?

1473
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:59,229
Infinite education to
everybody with no constraint.

1474
01:15:00,173 --> 01:15:01,788
And I think the same is true, right?

1475
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:03,359
With just about every other thing.

1476
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,359
If you wanna bring joy to the
world, you need digital music.

1477
01:15:08,759 --> 01:15:11,936
If you wanna bring
enlightenment to the world,

1478
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:13,867
you need digital education.

1479
01:15:13,868 --> 01:15:18,806
If you wanna bring anything
of consequence in the world,

1480
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:20,670
you gotta digitally transform it

1481
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:21,944
and then you gotta manufacture it

1482
01:15:21,944 --> 01:15:26,944
something like a hundred times
more efficiently as a start.

1483
01:15:27,224 --> 01:15:30,792
But a million times more efficiently

1484
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,125
is probably, that's hopeful.

1485
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:36,269
Maybe you have a chance.

1486
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:39,713
And if you look at all
of these space endeavors

1487
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:42,171
and everything, we're thinking
about getting to Mars,

1488
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,584
getting off the planet,
getting to other worlds.

1489
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:46,523
Number one thing you
gotta do is you gotta make

1490
01:15:46,523 --> 01:15:50,060
a fundamental breakthrough in an engine.

1491
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,717
People dreamed about flying
for thousands of years,

1492
01:15:52,716 --> 01:15:56,181
but until the internal combustion engine,

1493
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,681
you didn't have enough energy,

1494
01:15:59,595 --> 01:16:02,975
enough power in a light enough package

1495
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,011
in order to solve the problem.

1496
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:07,645
And the human race has all sorts

1497
01:16:07,645 --> 01:16:11,145
of those fundamental engines and materials

1498
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:17,327
and techniques that we need to master.

1499
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:21,259
And each one of them is a
lifetime of experimentation

1500
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:25,489
of someone capable of making
a seminal contribution

1501
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:28,536
to the body of human knowledge.

1502
01:16:28,536 --> 01:16:29,716
- There are certain
problems like education

1503
01:16:29,716 --> 01:16:31,646
that could be solved through this process

1504
01:16:31,646 --> 01:16:32,992
of dematerialization.

1505
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:37,910
And by the way, to give props
to the 500K algebra teachers.

1506
01:16:39,454 --> 01:16:41,046
When I look at YouTube, for example,

1507
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:45,426
one possible approach is each
one of those 500,000 teachers

1508
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:48,448
probably had days and
moments of brilliance.

1509
01:16:48,448 --> 01:16:50,863
And if they had ability to contribute to,

1510
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:53,038
in the natural selection
process like the market

1511
01:16:53,037 --> 01:16:56,454
of education where the best ones rise up.

1512
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,889
That's a really interesting way,

1513
01:16:58,889 --> 01:17:02,221
which is like the best day of your life,

1514
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:06,134
the best lesson you've ever taught

1515
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:11,923
could be found and sort of
broadcast to billions of people.

1516
01:17:15,009 --> 01:17:17,434
So all of those kinds of ideas

1517
01:17:17,434 --> 01:17:19,532
can be made real in the digital world.

1518
01:17:19,532 --> 01:17:23,413
Now, traveling across
planets, you still can't solve

1519
01:17:23,412 --> 01:17:26,412
that problem with dematerialization.

1520
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:29,860
Where you could solve potentially

1521
01:17:29,859 --> 01:17:31,704
is dematerializing the human brain

1522
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:34,734
where you can transfer,
like you don't need

1523
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:37,111
to have astronauts on the ship.

1524
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:41,188
You can have a floppy disc
carrying a human brain.

1525
01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:42,757
- Touching on those points.

1526
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:45,454
You'd love for the
500,000 algebra teachers

1527
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:48,845
to become 500,000 math specialists

1528
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:52,415
and maybe they comp into
50,000 specialties as teams

1529
01:17:52,416 --> 01:17:54,997
and they all pursue 50,000 new problems

1530
01:17:54,997 --> 01:17:57,838
and they put their algebra
teaching on autopilot.

1531
01:17:57,837 --> 01:17:58,688
- [Lex] Yeah.

1532
01:17:58,688 --> 01:18:01,487
- That's the same as
when I give you 11 cents

1533
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:05,904
worth of electricity and
you don't have to row a boat

1534
01:18:06,905 --> 01:18:09,951
eight hours a day before
you can eat, right?

1535
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:10,783
- [Lex] Yes.

1536
01:18:10,783 --> 01:18:13,699
- It would be a lot better,
that you would pay for your food

1537
01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:16,305
in the first eight seconds of your day

1538
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:20,296
and then you could start thinking
about other things, right?

1539
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,463
With regard to technology.

1540
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,908
One thing that I learned
studying technology,

1541
01:18:26,908 --> 01:18:31,778
when you look at S-curves is
until you start the S-curve

1542
01:18:31,778 --> 01:18:35,367
you don't know whether
you're a hundred years

1543
01:18:35,367 --> 01:18:39,255
from viability, a thousand
years from viability

1544
01:18:39,255 --> 01:18:41,837
or a few months from viability.

1545
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,606
- Isn't that fun?

1546
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:45,523
That's so fun.

1547
01:18:45,523 --> 01:18:48,586
The early part of the S-curve is so fun,

1548
01:18:48,586 --> 01:18:50,077
(chuckles) because you don't know.

1549
01:18:50,077 --> 01:18:55,077
- In 1900 you could have got
any number of learned academics

1550
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:58,634
to give you 10,000 reasons
why humans will never fly,

1551
01:18:58,634 --> 01:18:59,466
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

1552
01:18:59,466 --> 01:19:01,900
- And in 1903, the Wright brothers flew,

1553
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,340
and by 1969 we're walking on the moon.

1554
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:09,341
So the advance that we made in
that field was extraordinary.

1555
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:12,966
But for the a hundred
years and 200 years before,

1556
01:19:12,966 --> 01:19:16,021
they were just back and
forth and nobody was close.

1557
01:19:16,021 --> 01:19:18,189
And that's the happy part.

1558
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:20,585
The happy part is we went

1559
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:23,676
from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever

1560
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:27,259
to flying 25,000 miles
an hour in 66 years.

1561
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:34,149
The unhappy part is I studied
aeronautical engineering

1562
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:36,235
at MIT in the 80s.

1563
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:39,671
And in the 80s we had Gulfstream aircraft,

1564
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:43,634
we had Boeing 737s, we
had the space shuttle.

1565
01:19:43,634 --> 01:19:46,385
And you fast forward 40 years

1566
01:19:46,385 --> 01:19:49,404
and we pretty much had
the same exact aircraft.

1567
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:53,737
The efficiency of the
engines was 20, 30% more,

1568
01:19:55,606 --> 01:19:56,439
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

1569
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:00,522
- We slammed into a brick
wall around '69 to '75.

1570
01:20:02,685 --> 01:20:06,685
Like in fact the Global
Express, the Gulfstream,

1571
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:12,217
these were all engineered
in the 70s, some in the 60s.

1572
01:20:12,216 --> 01:20:17,216
The actual, the fuselage
silhouette of a Gulfstream,

1573
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:19,757
of a G5 was the same shape as a G4,

1574
01:20:19,757 --> 01:20:22,896
is the same shape as a G3,
is the same shape as a G2.

1575
01:20:22,896 --> 01:20:24,220
And that's because they were afraid

1576
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,545
to change the shape for 40 years

1577
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:28,242
because they worked it
out in a wind tunnel.

1578
01:20:28,242 --> 01:20:29,658
They knew it worked.

1579
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,795
And when they finally
decided to change the shape,

1580
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:35,829
it was like a $10 billion exercise

1581
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:40,829
with modern supercomputers and
computational fluid dynamics.

1582
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:42,591
- Why was this so hard?

1583
01:20:42,591 --> 01:20:46,846
What is that wall made
of that you slammed into?

1584
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:49,515
- The right question is, so
why does a guy that went to MIT

1585
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:51,193
that got an aeronautical
engineering degree

1586
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:52,871
spent his career in software?

1587
01:20:52,871 --> 01:20:53,703
- [Lex] Yeah.

1588
01:20:53,703 --> 01:20:56,273
- Like why is it that I
never a day in my life,

1589
01:20:56,273 --> 01:20:59,606
with the exception of some
Air Force reserve work,

1590
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,692
I never got paid to be
an aeronautical engineer

1591
01:21:01,692 --> 01:21:03,703
and I worked in software
engineering my entire career.

1592
01:21:03,703 --> 01:21:04,917
- Or maybe software engineering

1593
01:21:04,917 --> 01:21:08,917
is the new aeronautical
engineering in some way.

1594
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,179
Maybe you hit fundamental walls uncertain

1595
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:17,148
until you have to return to
it centuries later, or no.

1596
01:21:17,148 --> 01:21:19,389
- The National Gallery of Art

1597
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:22,945
was endowed by a very
rich man, Andrew Mellon,

1598
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:26,105
and you know how he made his money?

1599
01:21:26,105 --> 01:21:30,359
Aluminum, okay?
(Lex chuckles)

1600
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:32,538
And you know what kind of airplanes

1601
01:21:32,538 --> 01:21:35,260
you can create without aluminum?

1602
01:21:35,261 --> 01:21:36,402
Nothing.

1603
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:38,219
Nothing, right?

1604
01:21:38,219 --> 01:21:39,051
- [Lex] So, it's a material.

1605
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,256
So, it's a materials problem?

1606
01:21:40,256 --> 01:21:44,245
- Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances

1607
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:45,265
in metallurgy, right?

1608
01:21:45,265 --> 01:21:49,333
I mean, that was US Steel,
that was iron to steel,

1609
01:21:49,332 --> 01:21:51,884
aluminum, massive fortunes were created

1610
01:21:51,884 --> 01:21:54,737
because this was a
massive technical advance.

1611
01:21:54,737 --> 01:21:57,583
And then we also had the
internal combustion engine.

1612
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:00,746
And the story of Ford and General Motors

1613
01:22:00,747 --> 01:22:04,796
and Daimler Chrysler and the
like is informed by that.

1614
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:07,872
So you have no jet
engines, no rocket motors,

1615
01:22:07,872 --> 01:22:11,069
no internal combustion
engines, you have no aviation.

1616
01:22:11,069 --> 01:22:12,951
But even if you had those engines,

1617
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:15,247
if you were trying to build
those things with steel,

1618
01:22:15,247 --> 01:22:17,868
no chance, you had to have aluminum.

1619
01:22:17,868 --> 01:22:21,701
So there's like two
pretty basic technologies.

1620
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:25,551
And once you have those two technologies,

1621
01:22:25,551 --> 01:22:27,422
stuff happens very fast.

1622
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:31,755
So tell me the last big
advance in like jet engines,

1623
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:36,262
there hasn't been one.

1624
01:22:38,014 --> 01:22:40,592
The last big advance in rocket
engines hasn't been one.

1625
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:43,220
The big advances in spaceship design

1626
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:45,876
from what I can see are
in the control systems,

1627
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:49,944
the gyros and the ability to land, right,

1628
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:52,529
in a stable fashion,
that's pretty amazing.

1629
01:22:52,529 --> 01:22:54,179
Landing a rocket.

1630
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:59,039
- Also in the, at least
according to the Elon and so on,

1631
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:02,207
the manufacturer of the more efficient

1632
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:07,086
and less expensive
manufacturer of rockets.

1633
01:23:07,087 --> 01:23:08,715
So like it's production,
whatever that you call

1634
01:23:08,715 --> 01:23:12,032
that discipline of at scale manufacture,

1635
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:13,748
at scale production, so factory work.

1636
01:23:13,748 --> 01:23:15,476
But it's not 10X.

1637
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:19,074
I mean maybe it's 10X over
a period of a few decades.

1638
01:23:19,074 --> 01:23:23,244
- When we figure out how
to operate a spaceship

1639
01:23:23,244 --> 01:23:27,333
on the water, in your
water bottle for a year,

1640
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:28,224
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

1641
01:23:28,225 --> 01:23:29,682
- Now then you've got a breakthrough.

1642
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:34,131
So the bottom line is propulsion,
propulsion technology,

1643
01:23:34,131 --> 01:23:37,688
propellants, and the materials technology,

1644
01:23:37,689 --> 01:23:41,278
they were critical to getting
on that aviation S-curve.

1645
01:23:41,278 --> 01:23:44,949
And then we slammed into a wall in the 70s

1646
01:23:44,948 --> 01:23:49,531
and the Boeing 747, the Global
Express, the Gulfstream,

1647
01:23:50,679 --> 01:23:52,971
these things were, the space shuttle.

1648
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,062
They were all pretty
much reflective of that.

1649
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,256
And then we kind of, then we
stopped, and at that point,

1650
01:23:57,256 --> 01:23:59,463
you have to switch to a new S-curve.

1651
01:23:59,462 --> 01:24:04,130
So the next equivalent to the
internal combustion engine

1652
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:08,337
was the CPU and the next
aluminum equivalent was silicon.

1653
01:24:08,337 --> 01:24:11,516
So when we actually
started developing CPUs,

1654
01:24:11,515 --> 01:24:16,515
transistor gateway to CPUs,
and if you look at the power,

1655
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:19,485
right, the bandwidth
that we had on computers

1656
01:24:19,484 --> 01:24:21,689
and Moore's law, right?

1657
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:24,354
What if the efficiency of jet engines

1658
01:24:24,354 --> 01:24:29,354
had doubled every three years,
right, in the last 40 years.

1659
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,747
Where would we be right now, right?

1660
01:24:32,747 --> 01:24:36,348
So, I think that if
you're a business person,

1661
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:40,365
if you're looking for
commercially viable application

1662
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:44,918
of your mind, then you
have to find that S-curve.

1663
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:48,045
And ideally, you have to find it

1664
01:24:48,045 --> 01:24:51,221
in the first five, six, 10 years.

1665
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,184
But people always miss this.

1666
01:24:53,185 --> 01:24:55,213
Let's take Google Glass, right?

1667
01:24:55,212 --> 01:24:56,045
- [Lex] Yeah.

1668
01:24:56,046 --> 01:25:00,128
- Google Glass was a idea
2013, the year is 2022.

1669
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:04,320
And people were quite sure
this was gonna be a big thing.

1670
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,287
- And it could have been at
the beginning of the S-curve.

1671
01:25:07,287 --> 01:25:10,467
- But fundamentally, we didn't really have

1672
01:25:10,467 --> 01:25:12,457
an effective mechanism.

1673
01:25:12,457 --> 01:25:14,461
I mean, people getting vertigo and there-

1674
01:25:14,462 --> 01:25:15,386
- But you didn't know that

1675
01:25:15,386 --> 01:25:16,537
at the beginning of the S-curve, right?

1676
01:25:16,537 --> 01:25:17,770
- [Michael] We didn't have that.

1677
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,477
- I mean, maybe some people
had a deep intuition about

1678
01:25:20,476 --> 01:25:23,359
the fundamentals of augmented reality,

1679
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:25,871
but you don't know that, you don't have.

1680
01:25:25,872 --> 01:25:28,748
Those, you're looking through
the fog, you don't know.

1681
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:31,549
- So the point is, we're
at year zero in 2013,

1682
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:36,550
and we're still year zero in
2022 on that augmented reality.

1683
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:40,244
And when somebody puts
out a set of glasses

1684
01:25:40,244 --> 01:25:42,858
that you can wear comfortably

1685
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:45,326
without getting vertigo, right,

1686
01:25:45,326 --> 01:25:48,655
without any disorientation that managed

1687
01:25:48,655 --> 01:25:51,780
to have the stability and
the bandwidth necessary

1688
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:55,724
to sync with the real world,
you'll be in year one.

1689
01:25:55,724 --> 01:25:59,208
And from that point, you'll have a 70 year

1690
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:01,001
or some interesting future

1691
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:04,076
until you slam into a limit to growth

1692
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,158
and then it'll slow down.

1693
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,921
This is the story of a
lot of things, right?

1694
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:13,564
I mean, John D. Rockefeller
got in the oil business

1695
01:26:13,564 --> 01:26:18,147
in the 1860s, and the oil
business as we understood it,

1696
01:26:19,492 --> 01:26:23,074
became fairly mature
by the 1920s, the 30s.

1697
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,346
And then it actually stayed that way

1698
01:26:27,346 --> 01:26:29,592
until we got to fracking and like,

1699
01:26:29,592 --> 01:26:33,067
which was like seven years
later, and then it burst forward.

1700
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:35,320
- The interesting story
about Moore's law though

1701
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:38,769
is that you get this like constant burst

1702
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:42,146
of S-curves on top of
S-curves on top of S-curve.

1703
01:26:42,146 --> 01:26:45,256
It's like the moment
you start slowing down,

1704
01:26:45,256 --> 01:26:47,606
or almost ahead of you slowing down,

1705
01:26:47,605 --> 01:26:50,643
you come up with another
innovation, another innovation.

1706
01:26:50,644 --> 01:26:52,349
So like Moore's law doesn't seem to happen

1707
01:26:52,349 --> 01:26:55,266
in every technological advancement.

1708
01:26:56,119 --> 01:26:58,832
It seems like you only
get a couple of S-curves

1709
01:26:58,832 --> 01:27:01,494
and then you're done for a bit.

1710
01:27:01,493 --> 01:27:02,930
So I wonder what the pressures there are

1711
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:06,686
that resulted in such
success over several decades

1712
01:27:06,686 --> 01:27:07,988
and still going.

1713
01:27:07,988 --> 01:27:11,022
- Humility dictates that nobody knows

1714
01:27:11,023 --> 01:27:13,771
when the S-curve kicks off.

1715
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:18,771
And you could be 20 years
early or a hundred years early.

1716
01:27:19,203 --> 01:27:21,870
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo,

1717
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,863
they were designing flying machines

1718
01:27:24,863 --> 01:27:26,740
hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

1719
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:28,755
So humility says you're not quite sure

1720
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:31,836
when you really hit that
commercial viability.

1721
01:27:31,836 --> 01:27:35,345
And it also dictates, you
don't know when it ends.

1722
01:27:35,345 --> 01:27:37,677
Like when will the party stop?

1723
01:27:37,677 --> 01:27:40,256
When will Moore's law stop
and we'll get to the point

1724
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:42,347
where they're exponentially
diminishing returns

1725
01:27:42,347 --> 01:27:44,265
on silicon performance.

1726
01:27:46,126 --> 01:27:47,829
Just like we got exponentially

1727
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:51,510
diminishing returns on jet engines,

1728
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:54,962
and it just takes an exponential increase

1729
01:27:54,962 --> 01:27:57,835
in effort to make it 10% better.

1730
01:27:57,835 --> 01:27:59,765
But while you're in the middle of it,

1731
01:27:59,765 --> 01:28:01,630
then you know you can do things.

1732
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:05,686
So the reason that the digital
revolution is so important

1733
01:28:05,686 --> 01:28:10,686
is because the underlying
platforms, the bandwidth of,

1734
01:28:10,862 --> 01:28:12,810
and the performance of the components,

1735
01:28:12,810 --> 01:28:17,550
and I say the components
are the radio protocols,

1736
01:28:17,551 --> 01:28:20,218
mobile protocols, the batteries,

1737
01:28:22,739 --> 01:28:25,572
the CPUs, and the displays, right?

1738
01:28:26,462 --> 01:28:28,876
Those four components are pretty critical.

1739
01:28:28,876 --> 01:28:31,939
They're all critical in
the creation of an iPhone.

1740
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:34,564
I wrote about it in the
book, "The Mobile Wave,"

1741
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:38,061
and they catalyzed this
entire mobile revolution

1742
01:28:38,061 --> 01:28:42,484
because they have advanced
and continue to advance,

1743
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,242
they created the very fertile environment

1744
01:28:45,243 --> 01:28:48,806
for all these digital transformations.

1745
01:28:48,805 --> 01:28:52,805
And the digital transformations
themself, right?

1746
01:28:54,613 --> 01:28:58,443
They call for creativity
in their own, right?

1747
01:28:58,444 --> 01:29:01,033
Like, I think the interesting thing about

1748
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:04,150
let's take digital maps, right?

1749
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:05,960
When you conceptualize something

1750
01:29:05,961 --> 01:29:08,735
as a dematerialized map, right?

1751
01:29:08,735 --> 01:29:13,597
It becomes a map because
I can put it on a display

1752
01:29:13,597 --> 01:29:17,662
like an iPad, or I can put
it in a car like a Tesla.

1753
01:29:17,662 --> 01:29:20,478
But if you really wanna figure it out,

1754
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:21,820
you can't think like an engineer.

1755
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,831
You need to think like a fantasy writer.

1756
01:29:24,831 --> 01:29:26,880
Like this is where it's
useful if you studied,

1757
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,310
if you read, played,
"Dungeons and Dragons,"

1758
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,965
and you read, "Lord of the Rings,"

1759
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:34,484
and you studied all the fantasy literature

1760
01:29:34,484 --> 01:29:38,220
because when I dematerialize the map,

1761
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:41,909
first I put 10 million
pages of satellite imagery

1762
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,069
into the map, right?

1763
01:29:44,069 --> 01:29:47,659
That's a simple physical transform.

1764
01:29:47,659 --> 01:29:51,327
But then I start to put
telemetry into the map

1765
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:54,079
and I keep track of the
traffic rates on the roads,

1766
01:29:54,078 --> 01:29:56,010
and I tell you whether
you'll be in a traffic jam

1767
01:29:56,011 --> 01:29:57,974
if you drive that way, and I
tell you which way to drive,

1768
01:29:57,974 --> 01:30:01,083
and then I start to get
feedback on where you're going.

1769
01:30:01,082 --> 01:30:02,385
And I tell you the restaurant's closed

1770
01:30:02,386 --> 01:30:05,188
and people don't like it anyway.

1771
01:30:05,188 --> 01:30:06,797
And then I put an AI on top of it

1772
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:09,485
and I have a drive your car for you.

1773
01:30:09,485 --> 01:30:11,985
And eventually the implication

1774
01:30:13,006 --> 01:30:14,763
of digital transformation of maps

1775
01:30:14,764 --> 01:30:17,185
is I get in a self-driving car and I say,

1776
01:30:17,185 --> 01:30:20,384
"Take me someplace cool where I can eat."

1777
01:30:20,384 --> 01:30:21,625
- [Lex] Yeah.

1778
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,408
- And how did you get to
that last step, right?

1779
01:30:24,408 --> 01:30:26,826
It wasn't simple engineering.

1780
01:30:27,948 --> 01:30:31,104
There's a bit of fantasy
in there, a bit of magic.

1781
01:30:31,104 --> 01:30:33,878
- Design, art, whatever
the heck you call it.

1782
01:30:33,877 --> 01:30:35,032
It's whatever, yeah, yeah,

1783
01:30:35,032 --> 01:30:38,805
fantasy injects magic into
the engineering process.

1784
01:30:38,805 --> 01:30:42,805
Like imagination like
precedes great revolutions

1785
01:30:45,668 --> 01:30:46,805
in engineering.

1786
01:30:46,805 --> 01:30:48,473
It's like imagining a world,

1787
01:30:48,474 --> 01:30:51,529
like of what you can do with the display,

1788
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,022
how will the interaction be?

1789
01:30:53,021 --> 01:30:54,400
That's where Google
Glass actually came in.

1790
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,061
Augmented reality, virtual reality,

1791
01:30:56,061 --> 01:31:00,614
people were playing in the
space of sci-fi, imagination.

1792
01:31:00,614 --> 01:31:01,766
- They called it a moonshot.

1793
01:31:01,766 --> 01:31:03,444
They tried, it didn't
work, but to their credit,

1794
01:31:03,444 --> 01:31:04,938
they stopped trying, right?

1795
01:31:04,939 --> 01:31:07,304
And then there's new
people, they keep dreaming,

1796
01:31:07,304 --> 01:31:09,748
they're dreamers all around us.

1797
01:31:09,747 --> 01:31:12,018
I love those dreamers and most of 'em fail

1798
01:31:12,018 --> 01:31:13,900
and suffer because of it.

1799
01:31:13,900 --> 01:31:16,704
But some of them won win Nobel Prizes

1800
01:31:16,704 --> 01:31:19,025
or become billionaires.

1801
01:31:19,025 --> 01:31:23,777
- Well, what I would say
is if half the civilization

1802
01:31:23,777 --> 01:31:26,250
dropped what they were doing tomorrow

1803
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:29,582
and eagerly started working on launching

1804
01:31:30,644 --> 01:31:32,894
a rocket to Alpha San Tori,

1805
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,036
it might not be the best
use of our resources

1806
01:31:38,037 --> 01:31:41,271
because it's kind of
like if half of Athens

1807
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:44,327
in the year 500 BC eagerly started

1808
01:31:44,328 --> 01:31:47,599
working on flying machines,
if you went back and you said,

1809
01:31:47,599 --> 01:31:49,460
what advice would you give 'em?

1810
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:53,127
You would say, it's not gonna
work till you get to aluminum

1811
01:31:53,127 --> 01:31:54,282
and you're not gonna get to aluminum

1812
01:31:54,283 --> 01:31:57,806
till you work out the steel
and certain other things.

1813
01:31:57,805 --> 01:31:58,944
And you're not gonna get to that

1814
01:31:58,944 --> 01:32:01,094
until you work out the
calculus of variations

1815
01:32:01,094 --> 01:32:02,672
and some metallurgy.

1816
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:04,952
And there's a dude Newton
that won't come along

1817
01:32:04,953 --> 01:32:06,378
for quite a while and he's gonna give you

1818
01:32:06,377 --> 01:32:07,920
the calculus to do it.

1819
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,302
And until then it's hopeless.

1820
01:32:09,302 --> 01:32:13,346
So, you might be better
off to work on the aqueduct

1821
01:32:13,346 --> 01:32:16,625
or to focus upon sales or something.

1822
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:21,452
So if I look at this today,
I say there's massive

1823
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:25,699
profound environment civilization advances

1824
01:32:25,699 --> 01:32:28,368
to be made through digital
transformation of information.

1825
01:32:28,368 --> 01:32:29,637
And you can see them.

1826
01:32:29,637 --> 01:32:32,163
Like, this is the story of today.

1827
01:32:32,163 --> 01:32:33,615
This is not the story of today, right?

1828
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:36,532
It's 10 years old what we've been seeing.

1829
01:32:36,532 --> 01:32:38,274
- We're living through
different manifestations

1830
01:32:38,274 --> 01:32:39,994
of that story today too though.

1831
01:32:39,994 --> 01:32:40,827
- [Michael] Yeah.

1832
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:43,329
- Like social media, the effects of that

1833
01:32:43,328 --> 01:32:46,514
is very interesting because ideas spread,

1834
01:32:46,515 --> 01:32:48,583
even you talk about velocity of money,

1835
01:32:48,582 --> 01:32:51,656
the velocity of ideas keeps increasing.

1836
01:32:51,657 --> 01:32:52,489
- [Michael] Yeah.

1837
01:32:52,489 --> 01:32:55,612
- So like Wikipedia is a passive store,

1838
01:32:55,613 --> 01:32:57,547
it's a store of knowledge.

1839
01:32:57,546 --> 01:33:00,919
Twitter is like a, (chuckles)

1840
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,171
it's like a water hose or something.

1841
01:33:03,171 --> 01:33:04,896
It's like spraying you with knowledge

1842
01:33:04,895 --> 01:33:06,128
whether you want it or not.

1843
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:10,751
It's like social media is just
like this explosion of ideas

1844
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:11,912
and then we pick 'em up

1845
01:33:11,912 --> 01:33:14,362
and then we try to understand ourselves

1846
01:33:14,362 --> 01:33:18,206
because the drama of it also
plays with our human psyche.

1847
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:22,219
So sometimes there's more
ability for misinformation,

1848
01:33:22,219 --> 01:33:23,725
for propaganda to take hold.

1849
01:33:23,725 --> 01:33:25,350
So we get to learn about ourselves,

1850
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,091
we get to learn about the technology

1851
01:33:27,091 --> 01:33:29,020
that can decelerate the propaganda,

1852
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,713
for example, all that kind of stuff.

1853
01:33:30,713 --> 01:33:32,851
But like, the reality is we're living,

1854
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:34,086
I feel like we're living
through a singularity

1855
01:33:34,086 --> 01:33:36,836
in the digital information space.

1856
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:40,844
And we are not, we don't
have a great understanding

1857
01:33:40,844 --> 01:33:44,309
of exactly how it's
transforming our lives.

1858
01:33:44,309 --> 01:33:46,020
- This is where money is useful

1859
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,863
as a metaphor for significance.

1860
01:33:48,863 --> 01:33:53,863
Because if money is the economic
energy of the civilization,

1861
01:33:55,163 --> 01:33:59,728
then something that's
extraordinarily lucrative

1862
01:33:59,728 --> 01:34:02,832
that's gonna generate a
monetary or a wealth increase

1863
01:34:02,832 --> 01:34:06,002
is a way to increase the net
energy in the civilization.

1864
01:34:06,002 --> 01:34:09,658
And ultimately, if we had 10
times as much of everything,

1865
01:34:09,658 --> 01:34:13,762
we'd have a lot more
free resources to pursue

1866
01:34:13,762 --> 01:34:16,251
all of our advanced
scientific and mathematical

1867
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:17,818
and theoretical endeavors.

1868
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,618
So let's take Twitter, right?

1869
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:21,061
Twitter's something that could be 10 times

1870
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:23,748
more valuable than it is, right?

1871
01:34:23,748 --> 01:34:26,983
Twitter could be made 10 times better.

1872
01:34:26,983 --> 01:34:28,762
- Oh, by the way, I should say that.

1873
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:29,719
People should follow you on Twitter.

1874
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:30,942
Your Twitter account is awesome.

1875
01:34:30,942 --> 01:34:32,967
- Thank you.
(Lex chuckles)

1876
01:34:32,967 --> 01:34:33,800
Thank you.

1877
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:34,634
- It could be made 10 times better, yeah.

1878
01:34:34,634 --> 01:34:36,362
- Yeah, Twitter can be
made 10 times better.

1879
01:34:36,362 --> 01:34:39,444
If we take YouTube or take education,

1880
01:34:42,212 --> 01:34:45,434
we could generate a billion PhDs.

1881
01:34:45,434 --> 01:34:49,849
And the question is, do you
need any profound breakthrough

1882
01:34:49,849 --> 01:34:52,597
in materials or technology to do that?

1883
01:34:52,597 --> 01:34:53,837
And the answer is not really no.

1884
01:34:53,837 --> 01:34:58,837
So if you wanna, you could
make Apple, Amazon, Facebook,

1885
01:34:58,849 --> 01:35:02,266
Google, Twitter, all these things better.

1886
01:35:03,606 --> 01:35:06,292
The United States
government, if they took 1%

1887
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:09,963
of the money they spend on
the Department of Education

1888
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:13,461
and they simply poured
it into digital education

1889
01:35:13,462 --> 01:35:16,776
and they gave degrees to people

1890
01:35:16,775 --> 01:35:19,182
that actually met those requirements,

1891
01:35:19,182 --> 01:35:21,930
they could provide 100X as much education

1892
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:24,738
for 1/100 of the cost,

1893
01:35:24,738 --> 01:35:26,787
and they could do it
with no new technology.

1894
01:35:26,787 --> 01:35:30,370
That's a marketing and
political challenge.

1895
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:35,934
So I don't think every
objective is equally practical.

1896
01:35:37,381 --> 01:35:39,814
And I think the benefit
of being an engineer

1897
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:43,146
or thinking about practical achievements

1898
01:35:44,221 --> 01:35:48,804
is when the government pursues
an impractical objective

1899
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:53,037
or when anybody, an entrepreneur.

1900
01:35:53,037 --> 01:35:54,820
Not so bad with an entrepreneur

1901
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:56,291
'cause they don't have
that much money to waste.

1902
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:59,271
When a government pursues
an impractical objective,

1903
01:35:59,271 --> 01:36:01,894
they squander trillions
and trillions of dollars

1904
01:36:01,894 --> 01:36:03,186
and achieve nothing.

1905
01:36:03,186 --> 01:36:06,666
Whereas if they pursue
a practical objective

1906
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:11,538
or if they simply get out
of the way and do nothing,

1907
01:36:11,537 --> 01:36:13,262
and they allow the free market

1908
01:36:13,262 --> 01:36:15,315
to pursue the practical objectives,

1909
01:36:15,315 --> 01:36:17,757
then I think you can have profound impact

1910
01:36:17,757 --> 01:36:19,925
on the human civilization.

1911
01:36:21,764 --> 01:36:25,903
And if I look at the world we're in today,

1912
01:36:25,903 --> 01:36:29,320
I think that there are multi-trillion 10,

1913
01:36:32,442 --> 01:36:35,984
20, $50 trillion worth of opportunities

1914
01:36:35,984 --> 01:36:40,984
in the digital information
realm yet to be obtained.

1915
01:36:41,145 --> 01:36:45,594
But there's hundreds
of trillions of dollars

1916
01:36:45,594 --> 01:36:49,324
of opportunities in the
digital energy realm

1917
01:36:49,324 --> 01:36:53,595
that not only are they not
obtained, the majority of people

1918
01:36:53,595 --> 01:36:56,633
don't even know what digital energy is.

1919
01:36:56,634 --> 01:36:58,890
Most of them would reject the concept.

1920
01:36:58,890 --> 01:37:00,867
They're not looking for it,

1921
01:37:00,868 --> 01:37:03,037
they're not expecting to find it.

1922
01:37:03,037 --> 01:37:06,423
It's inconceivable because
it is a paradigm shift.

1923
01:37:06,423 --> 01:37:08,693
But in fact, it's completely practical,

1924
01:37:08,693 --> 01:37:10,948
right under our nose.

1925
01:37:10,948 --> 01:37:12,682
It's staring at us.

1926
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:15,662
And it could make the entire civilization

1927
01:37:15,662 --> 01:37:19,237
work dramatically better in every respect.

1928
01:37:19,238 --> 01:37:22,730
- So you mentioned in the digital world,

1929
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:27,119
digital information is
one, digital energy is two,

1930
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,119
and the possible impact on the world

1931
01:37:31,265 --> 01:37:33,560
and the set of opportunities available

1932
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:36,701
in the digital energy
space is much greater.

1933
01:37:36,702 --> 01:37:39,739
So how do you think about digital energy?

1934
01:37:39,739 --> 01:37:41,273
What is it?

1935
01:37:41,274 --> 01:37:43,524
- So I'll start with Tesla.

1936
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:45,713
He had a very famous quote.

1937
01:37:45,713 --> 01:37:47,274
He said, "If you wanna
understand the universe,

1938
01:37:47,274 --> 01:37:51,524
think in terms of energy,
vibration and frequency,"

1939
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:56,018
and it gets you thinking
about what is the universe?

1940
01:37:56,018 --> 01:37:59,270
And of course the universe
is just all energy.

1941
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,855
And then what does matter?

1942
01:38:00,854 --> 01:38:04,156
Matter is low frequency energy.

1943
01:38:04,157 --> 01:38:05,668
And what are we?

1944
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:07,494
We're vibrating from...

1945
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:10,363
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1946
01:38:10,363 --> 01:38:13,466
I can turn a tree into light.

1947
01:38:13,466 --> 01:38:16,271
I can turn light back into a tree

1948
01:38:16,271 --> 01:38:19,418
if I consider the entire universe.

1949
01:38:19,418 --> 01:38:20,626
And then it's very important

1950
01:38:20,626 --> 01:38:22,614
because we don't really think this way.

1951
01:38:22,613 --> 01:38:25,613
Let's take the New York disco model.

1952
01:38:26,755 --> 01:38:29,110
If I walk into a nightclub

1953
01:38:29,110 --> 01:38:32,849
and there's loud music
blaring in New York City,

1954
01:38:32,849 --> 01:38:35,649
what's really going on there, right?

1955
01:38:35,649 --> 01:38:39,527
If you blast out 15, 14 billion years ago,

1956
01:38:39,527 --> 01:38:41,288
the universe is formed.
- [Lex] Yeah.

1957
01:38:41,288 --> 01:38:42,876
- Okay, that's a low frequency thing.

1958
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:45,498
The universe, four and a
half billion years ago,

1959
01:38:45,498 --> 01:38:48,117
the sun, maybe the earth are formed.

1960
01:38:48,118 --> 01:38:51,520
The continents are 400 million years old.

1961
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,687
The shift that New York City is on

1962
01:38:53,686 --> 01:38:56,421
is some hundreds of millions of years.

1963
01:38:56,421 --> 01:38:59,374
But the Hudson River is only 20,000 years.

1964
01:38:59,373 --> 01:39:02,899
There's a building that's
probably 50 years old.

1965
01:39:02,899 --> 01:39:06,057
There's a company operating
that disco or that club,

1966
01:39:06,057 --> 01:39:08,365
which is five to 10 years old.

1967
01:39:08,365 --> 01:39:11,520
There's a person, a
customer walking in there

1968
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,281
for an experience for a few hours.

1969
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:19,271
There's music that's
oscillating at some kilohertz,

1970
01:39:19,271 --> 01:39:21,277
and then there's light.
- [Lex] Right.

1971
01:39:21,277 --> 01:39:24,501
- And you have all forms of energy,

1972
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:26,610
all frequencies, right?

1973
01:39:26,609 --> 01:39:29,897
All layered, all moving
through different medium.

1974
01:39:29,898 --> 01:39:33,244
And how you perceive the
world is a question of

1975
01:39:33,244 --> 01:39:37,291
at what frequency do you
want to perceive the world?

1976
01:39:37,292 --> 01:39:41,459
And I think that once you
start to think that way,

1977
01:39:44,105 --> 01:39:46,871
you're catalyze to think about

1978
01:39:46,871 --> 01:39:49,926
what would digital energy look like,

1979
01:39:49,926 --> 01:39:52,066
and why would I want it?

1980
01:39:52,065 --> 01:39:53,315
And what is it?

1981
01:39:54,524 --> 01:39:57,527
So why don't we just start right there.

1982
01:39:57,528 --> 01:39:59,172
What is it?

1983
01:39:59,171 --> 01:40:03,208
The most famous manifestation
of digital energy is Bitcoin.

1984
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,519
Bitcoin's a crypto asset.

1985
01:40:05,519 --> 01:40:08,673
It's a crypto asset
that has monetary value.

1986
01:40:08,672 --> 01:40:10,313
- Can we just linger on that?

1987
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:13,314
Bitcoin is a, so it is digital asset

1988
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,934
that has monetary value.

1989
01:40:18,935 --> 01:40:20,724
What is a digital asset?

1990
01:40:20,724 --> 01:40:21,556
What is monetary?

1991
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:26,556
Why use those terms versus the
words of money and currency?

1992
01:40:26,617 --> 01:40:27,789
Is there something interesting

1993
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:30,965
in that disambiguation of different terms?

1994
01:40:30,965 --> 01:40:34,029
- I'd call it a crypto asset network.

1995
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:37,779
The goal is to create
a billion dollar block,

1996
01:40:38,628 --> 01:40:40,961
a pure energy in cyberspace.

1997
01:40:42,881 --> 01:40:47,288
One that I could then
move with no friction

1998
01:40:47,287 --> 01:40:49,708
at the speed of light, right?

1999
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:54,708
It's the equivalent to putting
a million pounds in orbit.

2000
01:40:54,708 --> 01:40:59,708
How do I actually launch
something into orbit, right?

2001
01:40:59,775 --> 01:41:02,175
How do I launch something into cyberspace

2002
01:41:02,175 --> 01:41:04,208
that such that it moves friction free?

2003
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:07,125
And the solution is a decentralized

2004
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:10,343
proof of work network, right?

2005
01:41:10,342 --> 01:41:13,713
Satoshi's solution was,
I'm going to establish

2006
01:41:13,713 --> 01:41:16,783
protocol running on a
distributed set of computers

2007
01:41:16,783 --> 01:41:20,169
that will maintain a constant supply

2008
01:41:20,168 --> 01:41:23,051
of never more than 21 million Bitcoin

2009
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:26,288
sub dividable by a
hundred million satoshis,

2010
01:41:26,288 --> 01:41:30,288
each transferable via
transferring private keys.

2011
01:41:31,728 --> 01:41:34,728
Now the innovation is to create that

2012
01:41:38,421 --> 01:41:41,503
in a ethical, durable fashion, right?

2013
01:41:45,337 --> 01:41:48,747
The ethical innovation is
I want it to be property

2014
01:41:48,747 --> 01:41:50,433
and not a security.

2015
01:41:50,434 --> 01:41:53,853
A bushel of corn, an acre of land,

2016
01:41:53,853 --> 01:41:57,323
a stack of lumber and a bar of gold

2017
01:41:57,323 --> 01:41:59,781
and a Bitcoin are all property.

2018
01:41:59,782 --> 01:42:01,900
And that means they're all commonly

2019
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,283
occurring elements in the world.

2020
01:42:04,283 --> 01:42:05,703
You could call them commodities,

2021
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,841
but commodities a little bit misleading.

2022
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:09,389
And I'll tell you why in a second.

2023
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:12,757
But they're all distinguished
by the fact that no one entity

2024
01:42:12,756 --> 01:42:16,194
or person or government controls them.

2025
01:42:16,194 --> 01:42:19,853
If you have a barrel of
oil and you're in Ukraine

2026
01:42:19,854 --> 01:42:23,854
versus Russia versus Saudi
Arabia versus the US,

2027
01:42:24,759 --> 01:42:27,858
you have a barrel of oil, right?

2028
01:42:27,858 --> 01:42:31,052
And it doesn't matter
what the premier in Japan

2029
01:42:31,051 --> 01:42:35,708
or the mayor of Miami Beach
thinks about your barrel.

2030
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:38,202
They cannot wave their hand and make it

2031
01:42:38,202 --> 01:42:41,952
not a barrel of oil or
a cord of wood, right?

2032
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:46,712
And so property is just a
naturally occurring element

2033
01:42:46,712 --> 01:42:48,629
in the universe, right?

2034
01:42:49,487 --> 01:42:51,199
- Why use the word, ethical?

2035
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,117
And sorry to, I may
interrupt occasionally.

2036
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:56,868
Why ethical assigned to property?

2037
01:42:58,823 --> 01:43:01,091
- Because if it's a security,

2038
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,420
a security would be an example

2039
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:05,882
of a share of a stock or a crypto token

2040
01:43:05,881 --> 01:43:08,544
controlled by a small team.

2041
01:43:08,545 --> 01:43:12,502
And in the event that
something is a security

2042
01:43:12,502 --> 01:43:16,752
because some small group
or some identifiable group

2043
01:43:17,697 --> 01:43:21,257
can control its nature, character supply,

2044
01:43:21,257 --> 01:43:25,340
then it really only becomes
ethical to promote it

2045
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:29,615
or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures.

2046
01:43:31,716 --> 01:43:35,511
So, I'll give you maybe practical example.

2047
01:43:35,511 --> 01:43:38,956
I'm the mayor of Chicago, I give a speech.

2048
01:43:38,956 --> 01:43:40,805
In my speech, I'll say, I
think everybody in Chicago

2049
01:43:40,805 --> 01:43:44,210
should own their own
farm and have chicken,

2050
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:45,635
a chicken in the backyard

2051
01:43:45,635 --> 01:43:48,802
and their own horse and an automobile.

2052
01:43:49,778 --> 01:43:51,748
That's ethical.

2053
01:43:51,747 --> 01:43:53,193
I give the same speech and I say,

2054
01:43:53,194 --> 01:43:57,906
I think everybody in Chicago
should buy Twitter stock,

2055
01:43:57,905 --> 01:44:01,591
sell their house, or sell their
cash and buy Twitter stock.

2056
01:44:01,591 --> 01:44:03,919
Well, is that ethical?

2057
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:04,894
Not really.

2058
01:44:04,894 --> 01:44:07,036
But at that point, you've
entered into a conflict

2059
01:44:07,036 --> 01:44:10,490
of interest because what you're
doing is you're promoting

2060
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:15,333
an asset which is substantially
controlled by a small group

2061
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:19,284
of people, the board of directors
or the CEO of the company.

2062
01:44:19,284 --> 01:44:20,693
How would you feel

2063
01:44:20,694 --> 01:44:22,621
if the president of
the United States said,

2064
01:44:22,621 --> 01:44:26,953
I really think Americans
should all buy Apple stock.

2065
01:44:28,177 --> 01:44:30,140
Especially if you worked at Google.

2066
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:31,522
But you worked anywhere, you'd be like,

2067
01:44:31,523 --> 01:44:33,047
"Why isn't he saying buy mine?"

2068
01:44:33,047 --> 01:44:34,094
Right?

2069
01:44:34,094 --> 01:44:36,844
A security is a proprietary asset

2070
01:44:39,497 --> 01:44:41,668
in some way, shape or form.

2071
01:44:41,668 --> 01:44:44,005
And the whole nature of securities law,

2072
01:44:44,005 --> 01:44:47,324
it starts from this ancient idea

2073
01:44:47,324 --> 01:44:51,050
thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal, okay?

2074
01:44:51,050 --> 01:44:54,300
So if I'm going to sell you securities,

2075
01:44:55,698 --> 01:44:58,737
or I'm gonna promote
securities as a public figure

2076
01:44:58,737 --> 01:45:02,560
or as an influencer or
anybody else, right?

2077
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,414
If I create my own yo-yo
coin or Mikey coin,

2078
01:45:06,414 --> 01:45:09,246
and then there's a million of them,

2079
01:45:09,246 --> 01:45:12,324
and I tell you that I think
that it's a really good thing,

2080
01:45:12,324 --> 01:45:14,970
and Mikey coin will go up forever, right?

2081
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:16,496
And everybody buys Mikey coin,

2082
01:45:16,496 --> 01:45:19,091
and then I give 10 million to you

2083
01:45:19,091 --> 01:45:20,893
and don't tell the public, right?

2084
01:45:20,894 --> 01:45:22,498
I've cheated them.

2085
01:45:22,498 --> 01:45:25,331
Maybe if I have Mikey coin and I think

2086
01:45:25,331 --> 01:45:27,556
there's only 2 million Mikey coin,

2087
01:45:27,556 --> 01:45:29,873
and I swear to you there's only 2 million,

2088
01:45:29,873 --> 01:45:31,719
and then I get married
and I have three kids

2089
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:35,953
and my third kid is in the
hospital and my kid's gonna die

2090
01:45:35,953 --> 01:45:37,591
and I have this ethical reason

2091
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:39,961
to print 500,000 more Mikey coin

2092
01:45:39,961 --> 01:45:41,375
or else people are gonna die,

2093
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:43,969
and everybody tells me it's fine.

2094
01:45:43,969 --> 01:45:47,761
I've still abused the investor, right?

2095
01:45:47,761 --> 01:45:49,844
It's a ethical challenge.

2096
01:45:50,793 --> 01:45:55,043
If you look at ethics laws
everywhere in the world,

2097
01:45:57,453 --> 01:45:59,664
they all boil down to having a clause

2098
01:45:59,664 --> 01:46:01,509
which says that if you're a public figure,

2099
01:46:01,509 --> 01:46:05,067
you can't endorse any, a security,

2100
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:06,658
you can't endorse something
that would cause you

2101
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:08,711
to have a conflict of interest.

2102
01:46:08,712 --> 01:46:11,770
So if you're a mayor,
a governor, a country,

2103
01:46:11,770 --> 01:46:13,438
a public figure, an influencer,

2104
01:46:13,438 --> 01:46:16,962
and you want to promote or promulgate

2105
01:46:16,962 --> 01:46:20,641
or support something
using any public influence

2106
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:25,518
or funds or resources you may
have, it needs to be property.

2107
01:46:25,518 --> 01:46:27,320
It can't be security.

2108
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:30,162
So it goes beyond that, right?

2109
01:46:30,162 --> 01:46:31,856
I mean, like what the Chinese want

2110
01:46:31,856 --> 01:46:35,118
to support an American company, right?

2111
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:37,499
As soon as you look at
what's in the best interest

2112
01:46:37,498 --> 01:46:41,137
of the human race, the civilization,

2113
01:46:41,137 --> 01:46:46,025
you realize that if you want
an ethical path forward,

2114
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:50,608
it needs to be based on common
property, which is fair.

2115
01:46:52,311 --> 01:46:54,337
And the way you get to a common property

2116
01:46:54,337 --> 01:46:58,317
is through an open
permissionless protocol.

2117
01:46:58,317 --> 01:46:59,564
If it's not open, right?

2118
01:46:59,564 --> 01:47:01,960
If it's proprietary and
I know what the code says

2119
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,729
and you don't know what the code says,

2120
01:47:03,729 --> 01:47:05,811
that makes it a security.

2121
01:47:07,819 --> 01:47:12,509
If it's permissioned, if you're
not allowed on my network

2122
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:16,645
or if you can be censored
or booted off my network,

2123
01:47:16,645 --> 01:47:19,145
that also makes it a security.

2124
01:47:21,591 --> 01:47:25,952
So, when I talk about property,
I mean the challenge here

2125
01:47:25,952 --> 01:47:28,204
is how do I create
something that's equivalent

2126
01:47:28,204 --> 01:47:30,954
to a barrel of oil in cyberspace?

2127
01:47:33,127 --> 01:47:34,600
And that means it has to be

2128
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,022
a non sovereign bearer instrument,

2129
01:47:38,023 --> 01:47:41,690
open, permissionless,
not sensorable, right?

2130
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:46,989
If I could do that,
then I could deliver you

2131
01:47:46,989 --> 01:47:49,989
10,000 dematerialized barrels of oil

2132
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:54,152
and you would take settlement of them

2133
01:47:54,152 --> 01:47:56,563
and you would know that
you have possession

2134
01:47:56,563 --> 01:48:01,306
of that property regardless of
the opinion of any politician

2135
01:48:01,306 --> 01:48:05,378
or any company or anybody
else in the world.

2136
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:08,711
That's a really critical characteristic.

2137
01:48:09,634 --> 01:48:12,461
And it actually is, it's probably one

2138
01:48:12,461 --> 01:48:16,222
of the fundamental things
that makes Bitcoin special.

2139
01:48:16,222 --> 01:48:18,493
Bitcoin isn't just a crypto asset network,

2140
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:19,980
it's easy to create a
crypto asset network.

2141
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:24,648
It's very hard to create an
ethical crypto asset network

2142
01:48:25,863 --> 01:48:28,363
because you have to create one

2143
01:48:30,274 --> 01:48:35,100
without any government or
corporation or investor

2144
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,181
exercising into influence
to make it successful.

2145
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:41,763
- So, open, permissionless,
non-sensorable.

2146
01:48:42,997 --> 01:48:47,664
So basically no way for you
without explicitly saying so

2147
01:48:48,929 --> 01:48:51,161
outsourcing control to somebody else.

2148
01:48:51,161 --> 01:48:54,720
So it's a kinda, you have full control.

2149
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:58,447
Even with a barrel of
oil, what's the difference

2150
01:48:58,447 --> 01:49:02,467
between a barrel of oil
and a Bitcoin to you?

2151
01:49:02,466 --> 01:49:07,134
Because you kind of mentioned
that both are property is,

2152
01:49:08,717 --> 01:49:10,903
you mentioned Russia and China and so on.

2153
01:49:10,903 --> 01:49:14,168
Is it the ability of the
government to confiscate.

2154
01:49:14,167 --> 01:49:16,631
In the end, governments
can probably confiscate

2155
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:18,098
no matter what the asset is,

2156
01:49:18,099 --> 01:49:21,804
but you want to lessen
the effort involved.

2157
01:49:21,804 --> 01:49:24,237
- A barrel oil is a bucket
of physical property,

2158
01:49:24,237 --> 01:49:25,069
liquid property.

2159
01:49:25,069 --> 01:49:26,054
- [Lex] That's very complicated.

2160
01:49:26,055 --> 01:49:28,210
- And Bitcoin is a digital property.

2161
01:49:28,210 --> 01:49:32,877
- But it's easier to
confiscate a barrel of oil.

2162
01:49:32,877 --> 01:49:35,547
- It's easier to confiscate
things in the real world

2163
01:49:35,547 --> 01:49:39,157
than things in cyberspace, much easier.

2164
01:49:39,158 --> 01:49:40,485
- So, that's not universally true.

2165
01:49:40,484 --> 01:49:43,269
Some things in the digital
space are actually easier

2166
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:46,353
to confiscate because just the nature

2167
01:49:47,621 --> 01:49:50,760
of how things move easily
with information, right?

2168
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:52,622
- I think in the Bitcoin
world, what we would say

2169
01:49:52,622 --> 01:49:56,454
is that Bitcoin is the
most difficult property

2170
01:49:57,882 --> 01:49:59,625
that the human race possesses

2171
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:02,847
or has yet invented to confiscate.

2172
01:50:02,847 --> 01:50:04,222
And that's by virtue of the fact

2173
01:50:04,222 --> 01:50:06,895
that you could take possession
of it via your private key.

2174
01:50:06,895 --> 01:50:11,260
So, if you've got your 12
seed phrases in your head,

2175
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:14,365
then that would be the highest
form of property, right?

2176
01:50:14,365 --> 01:50:17,015
Because I literally have
to crack your head open

2177
01:50:17,015 --> 01:50:19,496
and read your mind to take it.

2178
01:50:19,496 --> 01:50:23,042
It doesn't mean I couldn't
extract it from you under duress,

2179
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:25,499
but it means that it's harder

2180
01:50:25,498 --> 01:50:27,890
than every other thing you might own.

2181
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:30,101
In fact, it's exponentially harder.

2182
01:50:30,101 --> 01:50:33,020
If you consider every other
thing you might own, a car,

2183
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:37,938
a house, a share of stock,
gold, diamonds, property rights,

2184
01:50:39,265 --> 01:50:42,532
intellectual property rights,
movie rights, music rights,

2185
01:50:42,532 --> 01:50:45,127
anything imaginable,
they would all be easier

2186
01:50:45,127 --> 01:50:48,778
by orders and orders
of magnitude to seize.

2187
01:50:48,779 --> 01:50:53,446
So digital property in the
form of a set of private keys

2188
01:50:54,918 --> 01:50:58,670
is by far the apex
property of the human race.

2189
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,279
In terms of ethics, I
wanna make one more point.

2190
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:02,892
It's like I might say to you, Lex,

2191
01:51:02,891 --> 01:51:05,327
I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure,

2192
01:51:05,328 --> 01:51:07,837
most durable crypto asset
network in the world,

2193
01:51:07,837 --> 01:51:09,289
is gonna go up forever,

2194
01:51:09,288 --> 01:51:11,630
and there's nothing better in the world.

2195
01:51:11,630 --> 01:51:15,056
I might be right, I might be wrong,

2196
01:51:15,055 --> 01:51:18,764
but the point is, because it's property,

2197
01:51:18,765 --> 01:51:21,583
it's ethical for me to say that.

2198
01:51:21,582 --> 01:51:23,235
If I were to turn around and say,

2199
01:51:23,235 --> 01:51:28,097
Lex, I think the same about
MicroStrategy stock, MSTR.

2200
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:29,993
That's a security, okay?

2201
01:51:29,993 --> 01:51:31,854
If I'm wrong about that,

2202
01:51:31,854 --> 01:51:35,271
I have civil liability or other liability

2203
01:51:36,461 --> 01:51:39,121
because I could go to a
board meeting tomorrow

2204
01:51:39,121 --> 01:51:40,864
and I could actually propose we issue

2205
01:51:40,864 --> 01:51:43,993
a million more shares
of MicroStrategy stock.

2206
01:51:43,993 --> 01:51:48,466
Whereas the thing that
makes Bitcoin ethical for me

2207
01:51:48,466 --> 01:51:52,135
to even promote is the knowledge
that I can't change it.

2208
01:51:52,136 --> 01:51:56,115
If I knew that I could make it 42 million

2209
01:51:56,114 --> 01:52:00,110
instead of 21 million and
I had the button back here,

2210
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:01,596
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

2211
01:52:01,596 --> 01:52:05,907
- Then I have a different degree
of ethical responsibility.

2212
01:52:05,907 --> 01:52:07,860
Now, I could tell you
your life will be better

2213
01:52:07,859 --> 01:52:09,599
if you buy Bitcoin, and it might not.

2214
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:11,673
You might go buy Bitcoin,
you might lose the keys

2215
01:52:11,673 --> 01:52:13,422
and be bankrupt and your life ends

2216
01:52:13,422 --> 01:52:14,893
and your life is not better

2217
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:16,514
because you bought Bitcoin, right?

2218
01:52:16,514 --> 01:52:19,981
But it wouldn't be my ethical liability

2219
01:52:19,981 --> 01:52:23,480
any more than if I were to say, Lex,

2220
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,952
I think you ought to get a farm.

2221
01:52:25,953 --> 01:52:27,512
I think you should be a farmer.

2222
01:52:27,511 --> 01:52:30,338
I think a chicken in every
pot, you should get a horse.

2223
01:52:30,338 --> 01:52:31,836
I think you'd be better.

2224
01:52:31,837 --> 01:52:36,337
I mean, they're all opinions
expressed about property,

2225
01:52:38,314 --> 01:52:39,692
which may or may not be right

2226
01:52:39,692 --> 01:52:42,875
that you may or may not agree with.

2227
01:52:42,875 --> 01:52:46,349
But in a legal sense, if we read the law,

2228
01:52:46,349 --> 01:52:49,069
if we understand securities
law, and I would say,

2229
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:51,799
you know, most people
in the crypto industry,

2230
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,606
they didn't take companies public,

2231
01:52:54,606 --> 01:52:56,930
and so they're not really
focused on the securities law.

2232
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:58,606
They don't even know the securities law.

2233
01:52:58,606 --> 01:53:01,586
If you focus on the
securities law, that would say

2234
01:53:01,586 --> 01:53:06,220
you just can't legally sell
this stuff to the general public

2235
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:11,180
or promote it without a full
set of continuing disclosures

2236
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:13,597
signed off on by a regulator.

2237
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:17,864
So, there's a fairly bright line there

2238
01:53:17,864 --> 01:53:19,953
with regard to securities.

2239
01:53:19,953 --> 01:53:23,353
But when you get to the secondary issue,

2240
01:53:23,353 --> 01:53:27,301
it's how do you actually build a world

2241
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:30,884
based on digital property
if public figures

2242
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:37,161
can't embrace it or endorse it, you see?

2243
01:53:37,161 --> 01:53:39,349
So you're not gonna build a better world

2244
01:53:39,349 --> 01:53:44,333
based upon Twitter stock if
that's your idea of property,

2245
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:47,189
because Twitter stock is a security,

2246
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:49,160
and Twitter stock is never going to be

2247
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:52,583
a non sovereign bearer
instrument in Russia, right?

2248
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:53,876
Or in China, right?

2249
01:53:53,877 --> 01:53:55,182
It's not even legal in China, right?

2250
01:53:55,182 --> 01:53:58,578
So it's not a global,
permissionless, open thing.

2251
01:53:58,578 --> 01:54:01,275
It will never be trusted
by the rest of the world,

2252
01:54:01,274 --> 01:54:03,847
and legally it's impractical.

2253
01:54:03,847 --> 01:54:06,927
But would you really wanna
put a hundred trillion dollars

2254
01:54:06,927 --> 01:54:09,280
worth of economic value on Twitter stock

2255
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,762
if there's a board of directors and a CEO

2256
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:13,864
that could just get up and
like take half of it tomorrow?

2257
01:54:13,864 --> 01:54:14,760
The answer is no.

2258
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:17,760
So if you wanna build a better world

2259
01:54:19,211 --> 01:54:21,713
based on digital energy, you need to start

2260
01:54:21,712 --> 01:54:25,474
with constructing a digital property.

2261
01:54:25,474 --> 01:54:28,753
And I'm using property here in the-

2262
01:54:28,752 --> 01:54:30,433
- Open, permissionless, non-sensorable.

2263
01:54:30,434 --> 01:54:31,542
- [Michael] In the legal sense.

2264
01:54:31,542 --> 01:54:32,375
- Okay.

2265
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:34,497
- But I would also go to the next step

2266
01:54:34,497 --> 01:54:37,830
and say property is low frequency money.

2267
01:54:39,579 --> 01:54:42,412
So if I give you a million dollars

2268
01:54:43,998 --> 01:54:46,757
and you wanna hold it for a decade,

2269
01:54:46,757 --> 01:54:49,525
you might go buy a house with it, right?

2270
01:54:49,525 --> 01:54:52,114
And the house is low frequency money.

2271
01:54:52,114 --> 01:54:56,346
You converted the million
dollars of economic energy

2272
01:54:56,346 --> 01:54:58,497
into a structure called a house.

2273
01:54:58,497 --> 01:54:59,855
Maybe in after a decade

2274
01:54:59,855 --> 01:55:02,170
you might convert it back into energy,

2275
01:55:02,171 --> 01:55:04,203
you might sell the house for currency,

2276
01:55:04,203 --> 01:55:06,659
and it'll be worth more or less

2277
01:55:06,658 --> 01:55:08,747
depending upon the
monetary climate you sell.

2278
01:55:08,747 --> 01:55:11,210
- The frequency means what here?

2279
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:14,394
How quickly it changes state?

2280
01:55:14,394 --> 01:55:17,498
- How quickly does something vibrate?

2281
01:55:17,498 --> 01:55:21,498
So if I transfer $10 from
me to you for a drink,

2282
01:55:25,225 --> 01:55:27,215
and then you turn around
and you buy another, right?

2283
01:55:27,215 --> 01:55:30,400
We're vibrating on a frequency
of every few hours, right?

2284
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,583
The energy is changing hands.

2285
01:55:32,583 --> 01:55:33,884
But it's not likely that you sell

2286
01:55:33,884 --> 01:55:37,123
and buy houses every few hours, right?

2287
01:55:37,123 --> 01:55:41,390
The frequency of a
transaction in real estate

2288
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:43,744
is every 10 years, every five,

2289
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:46,592
it's a much lower frequency transaction.

2290
01:55:46,592 --> 01:55:50,675
And so when you think
about what's going on here,

2291
01:55:52,444 --> 01:55:55,694
you have extremely low frequency things

2292
01:55:56,975 --> 01:55:58,877
which we'll call property,

2293
01:55:58,877 --> 01:56:02,056
then you have mid frequency things,

2294
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:05,182
I'm gonna call 'em money or currency.

2295
01:56:05,182 --> 01:56:09,634
And then you have high
frequency, and that's energy.

2296
01:56:09,634 --> 01:56:11,206
And that's why I use the illustration

2297
01:56:11,206 --> 01:56:13,984
of you got the building,
you got the light,

2298
01:56:13,984 --> 01:56:17,301
and you got the sound, and
they're all just energy

2299
01:56:17,301 --> 01:56:19,972
moving at different frequencies.

2300
01:56:19,971 --> 01:56:24,554
Now, Bitcoin is magical and
it is truly the innovation.

2301
01:56:26,617 --> 01:56:29,838
It's like a singularity
because it represents

2302
01:56:29,838 --> 01:56:32,733
the first time in the
history of the human race

2303
01:56:32,733 --> 01:56:34,130
that we managed to create

2304
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:37,380
a digital property properly understood.

2305
01:56:38,738 --> 01:56:43,269
It's easy to create
something digital, right?

2306
01:56:43,269 --> 01:56:47,546
Every coupon and every scan
on, "Fortnite," and, "Roblox,"

2307
01:56:47,546 --> 01:56:50,021
and Apple TV credits and all these things,

2308
01:56:50,021 --> 01:56:51,765
they're all digital something,

2309
01:56:51,765 --> 01:56:53,570
but they're securities, right?

2310
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:55,655
Shares of stock are securities.

2311
01:56:55,655 --> 01:56:57,595
Whenever anybody transfers,

2312
01:56:57,595 --> 01:57:00,275
when you transfer money
on PayPal or Apple Pay,

2313
01:57:00,275 --> 01:57:04,786
you're transferring in
essence a security or an IOU.

2314
01:57:04,786 --> 01:57:08,172
And so transferring a bearer instrument

2315
01:57:08,172 --> 01:57:12,123
with final settlement
in the internet domain

2316
01:57:12,123 --> 01:57:15,993
or in cyberspace, that's a critical thing.

2317
01:57:15,993 --> 01:57:20,005
And anybody in the
crypto world can do that.

2318
01:57:20,005 --> 01:57:21,743
All the cryptos can do that.

2319
01:57:21,743 --> 01:57:23,120
But what they can't do,

2320
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:26,960
what 99% of them fail
to do is be property.

2321
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,217
They're securities, right?

2322
01:57:28,217 --> 01:57:29,461
- Well, there's a line there

2323
01:57:29,462 --> 01:57:31,092
I'd like to explore a little further.

2324
01:57:31,091 --> 01:57:34,924
For example, what about
when you like Coinbase

2325
01:57:36,561 --> 01:57:39,130
or something like that,
when there's an exchange

2326
01:57:39,130 --> 01:57:42,739
that you buy, Bitcoin is
in, you start to move away

2327
01:57:42,738 --> 01:57:45,905
from this kind of, some of the aspects

2328
01:57:47,324 --> 01:57:50,298
that you said makes up a property,

2329
01:57:50,298 --> 01:57:55,048
which is this non-sensorable
and permissionless and open.

2330
01:58:00,127 --> 01:58:02,059
So in order to achieve the convenience,

2331
01:58:02,059 --> 01:58:06,398
the effectiveness of
the transfer of energy,

2332
01:58:06,398 --> 01:58:09,956
you have to leverage some of these,

2333
01:58:09,956 --> 01:58:12,920
of the places that remove
the aspects of property.

2334
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,096
So, maybe you can comment on that.

2335
01:58:15,096 --> 01:58:17,484
- Let me give you a good model for that.

2336
01:58:17,484 --> 01:58:20,756
If you think about the
layer one of Bitcoin,

2337
01:58:20,756 --> 01:58:23,674
the layer one is the
property settlement layer

2338
01:58:23,675 --> 01:58:27,926
and we're gonna do 350,000
transactions or less a day.

2339
01:58:27,926 --> 01:58:30,004
A hundred million transactions a year

2340
01:58:30,003 --> 01:58:32,288
is the bandwidth on the layer one.

2341
01:58:32,288 --> 01:58:35,324
And it would be an ideal layer one

2342
01:58:35,324 --> 01:58:38,143
to move a billion dollars
from point A to point B

2343
01:58:38,143 --> 01:58:40,947
with the massive security.

2344
01:58:40,947 --> 01:58:44,212
The role of the layer one is two things.

2345
01:58:44,212 --> 01:58:48,083
One thing is I wanna
move a large sum of money

2346
01:58:48,083 --> 01:58:51,113
through space with security.

2347
01:58:51,113 --> 01:58:55,695
I can move any amount of
Bitcoin in a matter of minutes

2348
01:58:56,577 --> 01:58:58,659
for dollars on layer one.

2349
01:58:59,604 --> 01:59:03,419
The second important
feature of the layer one

2350
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:06,800
is I need the money to
last forever, right?

2351
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,105
I need the money indestructible, immortal.

2352
01:59:09,105 --> 01:59:12,135
So, the bigger trick is not to move

2353
01:59:12,136 --> 01:59:14,169
a billion dollars from here to Tokyo.

2354
01:59:14,168 --> 01:59:16,010
The big trick is to move a billion dollars

2355
01:59:16,011 --> 01:59:18,261
from here to the year 2140.

2356
01:59:20,061 --> 01:59:24,309
And that's what we wanna
solve with layer one.

2357
01:59:24,309 --> 01:59:27,034
And the best real
metaphor in New York City

2358
01:59:27,034 --> 01:59:29,673
would be the granite or the schist.

2359
01:59:29,673 --> 01:59:33,256
What you want is a city block of bedrock.

2360
01:59:33,256 --> 01:59:35,219
And how long has it been there?

2361
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:37,516
Like millions of years it's been there.

2362
01:59:37,515 --> 01:59:39,613
And how fast you want it to move?

2363
01:59:39,613 --> 01:59:40,857
You don't.

2364
01:59:40,858 --> 01:59:42,373
In fact, the single thing

2365
01:59:42,373 --> 01:59:45,619
that's most important
is that it not deflect.

2366
01:59:45,619 --> 01:59:49,666
If it deflects a foot in a
hundred years, it's too much.

2367
01:59:49,666 --> 01:59:51,737
If it deflects an inch in a hundred years,

2368
01:59:51,737 --> 01:59:53,253
you might not want that.

2369
01:59:53,253 --> 01:59:56,145
So the layer one of
Bitcoin is a foundation

2370
01:59:56,145 --> 01:59:57,819
upon which you put weight.

2371
01:59:57,819 --> 01:59:59,793
How much weight can you put on it?

2372
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:01,233
You put a trillion, 10 trillion,

2373
02:00:01,233 --> 02:00:04,613
a hundred trillion, a quadrillion.

2374
02:00:04,613 --> 02:00:08,350
How much weight's on the
bedrock in Manhattan, right?

2375
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:10,742
Think about a hundred story buildings.

2376
02:00:10,742 --> 02:00:15,435
So the real key there is
the foundational asset

2377
02:00:15,435 --> 02:00:17,173
needs to be there at all.

2378
02:00:17,172 --> 02:00:18,735
So the fact that you can create

2379
02:00:18,735 --> 02:00:21,550
a hundred trillion dollars layer one

2380
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:23,685
that would stand for a hundred years,

2381
02:00:23,685 --> 02:00:27,920
that is the revolutionary
breakthrough first time.

2382
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,872
And the fact that it's ethical, right?

2383
02:00:29,872 --> 02:00:32,240
It's ethical and it's common property.

2384
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:33,953
global, permissionless.

2385
02:00:33,953 --> 02:00:36,536
Extremely unlikely that would happen.

2386
02:00:36,536 --> 02:00:39,617
People tried 50 times
before and they all failed.

2387
02:00:39,617 --> 02:00:42,932
They tried 15,000 times
after, and they've all been,

2388
02:00:42,932 --> 02:00:44,690
they've all generally failed.

2389
02:00:44,690 --> 02:00:49,117
98% have failed and a couple
have like been less successful.

2390
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:54,085
But for the most part, that's
an extraordinary thing.

2391
02:00:54,085 --> 02:00:56,088
- Just really quickly pause

2392
02:00:56,088 --> 02:00:58,849
just to find some terms people don't know.

2393
02:00:58,849 --> 02:01:02,239
Layer one is that Michael's referring to

2394
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:05,792
is in general what people know of

2395
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:10,068
as the Bitcoin technology
originally defined,

2396
02:01:10,069 --> 02:01:11,916
which is there's blockchain,

2397
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:14,654
there's a consensus
mechanism of proof of work,

2398
02:01:14,654 --> 02:01:16,398
low number of transactions,

2399
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:20,231
but you can move a very
large amount of money.

2400
02:01:22,778 --> 02:01:24,664
The reason he's using the term layer one

2401
02:01:24,663 --> 02:01:27,677
is now that there's a lot of
ideas of layer two technologies

2402
02:01:27,677 --> 02:01:30,537
that built on top of this
bedrock that allow you

2403
02:01:30,537 --> 02:01:34,287
to move a much larger
number of transactions.

2404
02:01:36,759 --> 02:01:39,905
So sort of higher frequency,

2405
02:01:39,905 --> 02:01:41,493
I don't know what
terminology I wanna to use,

2406
02:01:41,493 --> 02:01:44,023
but basically be able to use now something

2407
02:01:44,023 --> 02:01:47,605
that is based on Bitcoin
to then buy stuff,

2408
02:01:48,457 --> 02:01:52,591
be a consumer to transfer
money, to use it as currency.

2409
02:01:52,591 --> 02:01:55,157
Just to define some terms.

2410
02:01:55,157 --> 02:01:58,657
- Yeah, so the layer one is the foundation

2411
02:02:00,354 --> 02:02:03,206
for the entire cyber economy,

2412
02:02:03,207 --> 02:02:06,039
and we don't want it to move fast.

2413
02:02:07,608 --> 02:02:11,690
What we want is immortality,
incorrupt, immortal,

2414
02:02:12,925 --> 02:02:16,204
incorruptible and destructible, right?

2415
02:02:16,203 --> 02:02:17,331
That's what you want.

2416
02:02:17,332 --> 02:02:19,146
Integrity from the layer one.

2417
02:02:19,146 --> 02:02:21,600
Now there's layer two and layer three.

2418
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:25,320
And layer two I would define
as an open, permissionless,

2419
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,988
non-custodial protocol that uses

2420
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:33,068
the underlying layer one
token as it's gas fee.

2421
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:36,198
- So what's custodial mean

2422
02:02:36,198 --> 02:02:38,492
and how does the different markets,

2423
02:02:38,493 --> 02:02:40,668
like is Lightning Network?

2424
02:02:40,667 --> 02:02:42,692
- So Lightning Network would be an example

2425
02:02:42,693 --> 02:02:44,987
of a layer two, non-custodial.

2426
02:02:44,987 --> 02:02:49,987
So the Lightning Network
will sit on top of layer one,

2427
02:02:50,014 --> 02:02:53,288
it'll sit on top of
Bitcoin and it solves the,

2428
02:02:53,287 --> 02:02:55,270
what you wanna do is solve the problem

2429
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:57,051
of it's well and fine,

2430
02:02:57,051 --> 02:02:59,853
I don't wanna move a
billion dollars every day.

2431
02:02:59,854 --> 02:03:03,686
What I wanna move is $5
a billion times a day.

2432
02:03:05,171 --> 02:03:08,570
So if I wanna move $5
a billion times a day,

2433
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:12,640
I don't really need to put
the entire trillion dollars

2434
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:16,119
of assets at risk every time I move $5.

2435
02:03:16,119 --> 02:03:17,574
All I really need to do

2436
02:03:17,574 --> 02:03:20,597
is put a hundred thousand
dollars in a channel

2437
02:03:20,597 --> 02:03:22,387
or a million dollars in a channel,

2438
02:03:22,387 --> 02:03:24,497
and then I do 10 million transactions

2439
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:27,265
where I have a million dollars at risk.

2440
02:03:27,265 --> 02:03:30,097
And of course it's kind of simple.

2441
02:03:31,979 --> 02:03:36,726
If I lower my security requirement
by a factor of a million,

2442
02:03:36,726 --> 02:03:39,811
I can probably move the stuff
a million times faster, right?

2443
02:03:39,811 --> 02:03:41,444
And that's how Lightning works.

2444
02:03:41,444 --> 02:03:45,239
It's non-custodial because
there's no corporation

2445
02:03:45,239 --> 02:03:50,239
or custodian or counterparty
you're trusting, right?

2446
02:03:50,359 --> 02:03:53,449
There's the risk of moving
through the channel,

2447
02:03:53,449 --> 02:03:55,699
but Lightning is an example

2448
02:03:57,399 --> 02:04:00,965
of how I go from 350,000
transactions a day

2449
02:04:00,965 --> 02:04:03,663
to 350 million transactions a day.

2450
02:04:03,663 --> 02:04:06,427
So on that layer two, you
could move the Bitcoin

2451
02:04:06,427 --> 02:04:08,615
in seconds for fractions of pennies.

2452
02:04:08,615 --> 02:04:11,000
Now that's not the end all be all

2453
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,082
because the truth is there
are a lot of open protocols.

2454
02:04:15,082 --> 02:04:17,551
Lightning probably won't be the only one.

2455
02:04:17,551 --> 02:04:19,198
There's a open market competition

2456
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:22,179
of other permissionless
open source protocols

2457
02:04:22,179 --> 02:04:23,623
to do this work.

2458
02:04:23,622 --> 02:04:26,872
And in theory, any other crypto network

2459
02:04:28,953 --> 02:04:33,953
that was deemed to be property,
deemed to be non security,

2460
02:04:34,368 --> 02:04:35,572
you could also think of

2461
02:04:35,572 --> 02:04:38,557
as potentially a layer
two to Bitcoin, right?

2462
02:04:38,557 --> 02:04:41,363
There's a debate about are
there any and what are they?

2463
02:04:41,363 --> 02:04:44,034
And we could leave that for a later time.

2464
02:04:44,034 --> 02:04:47,126
- But why do you think
of them as layer two

2465
02:04:47,126 --> 02:04:50,887
as opposed to contending for layer one?

2466
02:04:50,886 --> 02:04:53,381
- Yeah, actually if they're
using their own token,

2467
02:04:53,381 --> 02:04:55,259
then they are a layer one.

2468
02:04:55,259 --> 02:04:56,663
If you create an open protocol

2469
02:04:56,663 --> 02:04:59,565
that uses the Bitcoin
token got as the fee-

2470
02:04:59,565 --> 02:05:01,212
- [Lex] I got you, I got you.

2471
02:05:01,212 --> 02:05:02,528
- Then it becomes a layer two,

2472
02:05:02,529 --> 02:05:04,000
right?
- [Lex] Okay.

2473
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,744
- Bitcoin itself, right,
incentivizes its own transactions

2474
02:05:07,744 --> 02:05:08,989
with its own token.

2475
02:05:08,989 --> 02:05:11,789
And that's what makes it layer one.

2476
02:05:11,789 --> 02:05:14,384
- Okay, what's layer three then?

2477
02:05:14,384 --> 02:05:16,795
- Layer three is a custodial layer.

2478
02:05:16,795 --> 02:05:21,795
So if you wanna move Bitcoin
in milliseconds for free,

2479
02:05:21,863 --> 02:05:26,567
you move it through Binance
or Coinbase or Cash App.

2480
02:05:26,567 --> 02:05:28,247
So this is a very straightforward thing.

2481
02:05:28,247 --> 02:05:30,778
I mean it seems pretty obvious
when you think about it

2482
02:05:30,778 --> 02:05:33,001
that there are gonna be
hundreds of thousands

2483
02:05:33,001 --> 02:05:37,261
of layer threes, there may
be dozens of layer twos.

2484
02:05:37,261 --> 02:05:40,367
I mean Lightning is a one,
but it's not the only one.

2485
02:05:40,367 --> 02:05:43,149
Anybody can invent something, right?

2486
02:05:43,149 --> 02:05:48,066
And we can have this debate
about custodial, non-custodial.

2487
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:52,704
- Don't you think there's a

2488
02:05:52,704 --> 02:05:56,372
monopolization possibilities
at layer three?

2489
02:05:59,548 --> 02:06:03,216
So, you mentioned Binance, Coinbase,

2490
02:06:03,216 --> 02:06:05,259
what if they start to dominate

2491
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:09,007
and basically everybody's using
them practically speaking,

2492
02:06:09,007 --> 02:06:10,800
and then it becomes too costly

2493
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,300
to memorize the private key in your brain.

2494
02:06:15,832 --> 02:06:20,343
I mean, or like cold storage
of layer one technology.

2495
02:06:20,342 --> 02:06:22,967
- Well, the idealist fear the layer threes

2496
02:06:22,967 --> 02:06:25,389
because they think, and
especially they detest,

2497
02:06:25,389 --> 02:06:27,556
they would detest a bit...

2498
02:06:28,807 --> 02:06:31,457
There's almost like a layer
four by the way, if you want to.

2499
02:06:31,457 --> 02:06:35,475
A layer four would be, I've
got Bitcoin on an application,

2500
02:06:35,475 --> 02:06:38,128
but I can't withdraw it.

2501
02:06:38,128 --> 02:06:40,948
So, I've got an application
that's backed by Bitcoin,

2502
02:06:40,948 --> 02:06:43,168
but the Bitcoin is sealed.

2503
02:06:43,167 --> 02:06:44,929
It's a proprietary example.

2504
02:06:44,929 --> 02:06:45,836
And I'll give you an example of that.

2505
02:06:45,836 --> 02:06:48,994
That would be like gray scale.

2506
02:06:48,993 --> 02:06:53,161
If I own a share of GBTC,
and so I own a security.

2507
02:06:54,493 --> 02:06:56,826
Actually you could own MSTR.

2508
02:06:57,847 --> 02:06:59,926
If you own a security or you own a product

2509
02:06:59,926 --> 02:07:01,793
that has Bitcoin embedded in it,

2510
02:07:01,792 --> 02:07:04,381
you get the benefits of Bitcoin,

2511
02:07:04,381 --> 02:07:08,237
but you don't have the
ability to withdraw the asset.

2512
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,238
- You can the security
market at layer four.

2513
02:07:11,238 --> 02:07:13,387
Am I understanding this correctly?

2514
02:07:13,386 --> 02:07:16,018
- I don't know if I would say.

2515
02:07:16,019 --> 02:07:17,711
Not all securities are layer four,

2516
02:07:17,711 --> 02:07:21,609
but anything that's a proprietary product

2517
02:07:21,609 --> 02:07:24,442
based upon with Bitcoin embedded in it

2518
02:07:24,442 --> 02:07:26,579
where you can't withdraw the Bitcoin

2519
02:07:26,579 --> 02:07:29,453
is another application of Bitcoin.

2520
02:07:29,453 --> 02:07:34,063
So, if you think about
different ways you can use this,

2521
02:07:34,064 --> 02:07:36,722
you can either stay
completely on the layer one

2522
02:07:36,721 --> 02:07:39,304
and use the base chain
for your transactions

2523
02:07:39,304 --> 02:07:41,664
or you can limit yourself

2524
02:07:41,664 --> 02:07:44,244
to layer one in layer two Lightning.

2525
02:07:44,244 --> 02:07:46,543
And the purist would say, "We stay there.

2526
02:07:46,543 --> 02:07:49,072
Get your Bitcoin off the exchange."

2527
02:07:49,072 --> 02:07:51,417
But you could also go to the layer three.

2528
02:07:51,417 --> 02:07:55,063
When Cash App supported
Bitcoin, they made it very easy

2529
02:07:55,063 --> 02:07:58,283
to buy it and then they gave
you the ability of withdraw.

2530
02:07:58,283 --> 02:08:01,261
When PayPal or I think
Robinhood let you buy it,

2531
02:08:01,261 --> 02:08:02,690
they wouldn't let you withdraw it,

2532
02:08:02,690 --> 02:08:03,903
and it was a big community uproar.

2533
02:08:03,904 --> 02:08:06,926
And people want, they
want these layer threes

2534
02:08:06,926 --> 02:08:09,592
to make it possible to
withdraw the Bitcoin,

2535
02:08:09,591 --> 02:08:12,277
so you can take it to
your own private wallet

2536
02:08:12,278 --> 02:08:14,649
and get it off the exchange.

2537
02:08:14,649 --> 02:08:16,061
I think the answer to the question

2538
02:08:16,061 --> 02:08:18,259
of well is corruption possible?

2539
02:08:18,259 --> 02:08:22,703
Is corruption is possible
in all human institutions

2540
02:08:22,703 --> 02:08:25,431
and all governments everywhere.

2541
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:27,377
The difference between digital property

2542
02:08:27,377 --> 02:08:30,443
and physical property is
when you own a building

2543
02:08:30,444 --> 02:08:35,235
in Los Angeles and the city
politics turn against you,

2544
02:08:35,234 --> 02:08:36,762
you can't move the building.

2545
02:08:36,762 --> 02:08:37,595
- [Lex] Yeah.

2546
02:08:37,595 --> 02:08:41,190
- And when you own a share of a security

2547
02:08:41,190 --> 02:08:43,594
that's like a US traded security

2548
02:08:43,594 --> 02:08:46,791
and you wish to move
to some other country,

2549
02:08:46,791 --> 02:08:50,806
you can't take the
security with you either.

2550
02:08:50,805 --> 02:08:52,333
And when you own a bunch of gold

2551
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:53,947
and you try to get through the airport,

2552
02:08:53,948 --> 02:08:55,920
they might not let you take it.

2553
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,502
So Bitcoin is advantageous
versus all those

2554
02:09:01,042 --> 02:09:03,432
because you actually do have the option

2555
02:09:03,432 --> 02:09:06,970
to withdraw your asset from the exchange.

2556
02:09:06,970 --> 02:09:09,470
And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity

2557
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:11,859
and you had shares of stock with Fidelity

2558
02:09:11,859 --> 02:09:16,091
and if you had bonds and
sovereign debt with Fidelity,

2559
02:09:16,091 --> 02:09:18,758
and if you own some mutual funds

2560
02:09:20,271 --> 02:09:23,756
and some other random limited
partnerships with Fidelity,

2561
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:26,804
none of those things can be
removed from the custodian,

2562
02:09:26,804 --> 02:09:30,328
but the Bitcoin, you can
take off the exchange,

2563
02:09:30,328 --> 02:09:33,161
you can remove from the custodian.

2564
02:09:34,519 --> 02:09:36,275
- It's still possible though.

2565
02:09:36,274 --> 02:09:37,395
- [Michael] There's a deterrent.

2566
02:09:37,395 --> 02:09:38,308
- Yes.
- There's a deterrent.

2567
02:09:38,309 --> 02:09:40,711
That's an anti-corruption element.

2568
02:09:40,711 --> 02:09:42,818
And the phrase is an armed society

2569
02:09:42,818 --> 02:09:45,338
is a polite society, right?

2570
02:09:45,338 --> 02:09:48,735
Because you have the
optionality to withdraw

2571
02:09:48,735 --> 02:09:52,436
all your assets from the crypto exchange,

2572
02:09:52,436 --> 02:09:54,568
you can enforce fairness.

2573
02:09:54,568 --> 02:09:57,318
And at the point where you
disagree with their policies,

2574
02:09:57,318 --> 02:10:00,563
you can within an hour move your assets

2575
02:10:00,563 --> 02:10:02,033
to another counterparty

2576
02:10:02,033 --> 02:10:04,583
or take personal custody of those assets,

2577
02:10:04,582 --> 02:10:06,268
and you don't have that option

2578
02:10:06,268 --> 02:10:08,840
with most other forms of property.

2579
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:11,538
Maybe you don't have as much optionality

2580
02:10:11,538 --> 02:10:13,972
with any other form of property on earth.

2581
02:10:13,972 --> 02:10:17,528
And so what makes
digital property distinct

2582
02:10:17,528 --> 02:10:22,278
is the fact that it has the
most optionality for custody.

2583
02:10:23,662 --> 02:10:25,690
Now, coming back to this
digital energy issue.

2584
02:10:25,690 --> 02:10:29,247
The real key point is the
energy moves in milliseconds

2585
02:10:29,247 --> 02:10:33,541
for free on layer threes,
it moves in seconds

2586
02:10:33,542 --> 02:10:36,130
or less than seconds on layer twos.

2587
02:10:36,130 --> 02:10:39,663
It moves in minutes on the layer one.

2588
02:10:39,662 --> 02:10:42,701
And I don't think it makes any sense

2589
02:10:42,702 --> 02:10:44,997
to even think about trying to solve

2590
02:10:44,997 --> 02:10:47,113
all three problems on the layer one,

2591
02:10:47,113 --> 02:10:49,846
because it's impossible
to achieve the security

2592
02:10:49,845 --> 02:10:53,282
and the incorruptibility and immortality

2593
02:10:53,283 --> 02:10:55,220
if you try to build that much speed

2594
02:10:55,220 --> 02:10:58,253
and that functionality and performance.

2595
02:10:58,253 --> 02:11:01,842
In fact, if you come back
to the New York model,

2596
02:11:01,842 --> 02:11:03,983
you really wanted a block of granite,

2597
02:11:03,983 --> 02:11:06,373
a building, and a company.

2598
02:11:06,372 --> 02:11:08,861
That's what makes the economy, right?

2599
02:11:08,862 --> 02:11:11,567
If I said to you, "You're
gonna build a building,

2600
02:11:11,567 --> 02:11:13,398
but you can only have one company in it

2601
02:11:13,398 --> 02:11:16,761
for the life of the building,"
it would be very fragile.

2602
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:18,182
Like very brittle.

2603
02:11:18,181 --> 02:11:21,743
What company a hundred years
ago is still relevant today?

2604
02:11:21,743 --> 02:11:23,233
You want all three layers

2605
02:11:23,234 --> 02:11:26,709
because they all oscillate
at different frequencies.

2606
02:11:26,708 --> 02:11:30,063
And there's a tendency to think, "Well,

2607
02:11:30,063 --> 02:11:34,199
it's gotta be this L1
or that L1," not really.

2608
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:35,346
And sometimes people think,

2609
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:38,878
"Well, I don't really want any L3,"

2610
02:11:38,878 --> 02:11:41,246
but companies, it's not an even or.

2611
02:11:41,246 --> 02:11:45,938
Companies are better than
crypto asset networks

2612
02:11:45,938 --> 02:11:47,319
at certain things.

2613
02:11:47,319 --> 02:11:50,135
If you want complexity, you
want to implement complexity

2614
02:11:50,135 --> 02:11:53,682
or you wanna implement compliance

2615
02:11:53,682 --> 02:11:56,020
or customer service, right?

2616
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:59,215
Companies do these things well, right?

2617
02:11:59,216 --> 02:12:00,133
We know it.

2618
02:12:02,037 --> 02:12:06,488
You couldn't decentralize Apple
or Netflix or even YouTube.

2619
02:12:06,488 --> 02:12:08,659
The performance wouldn't be there

2620
02:12:08,659 --> 02:12:10,442
and the subtlety wouldn't be there.

2621
02:12:10,442 --> 02:12:15,115
And you can't really legally
decentralize certain forms

2622
02:12:15,115 --> 02:12:18,458
of banking and insurance because
they would become illegal

2623
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:20,322
in the political jurisdiction they're in.

2624
02:12:20,322 --> 02:12:22,737
So unless you're a crypto anarchist

2625
02:12:22,737 --> 02:12:27,737
and you believe in no companies
and no nation states, right?

2626
02:12:27,889 --> 02:12:30,798
Which is just not very practical.

2627
02:12:30,798 --> 02:12:32,385
Not anytime soon.

2628
02:12:32,385 --> 02:12:35,088
Once you allow that nation
states will continue

2629
02:12:35,087 --> 02:12:36,805
and companies have a role,

2630
02:12:36,805 --> 02:12:40,513
then the layered architecture follows,

2631
02:12:40,514 --> 02:12:43,846
and the free market determines who wins.

2632
02:12:45,782 --> 02:12:49,146
For example, there are layer threes

2633
02:12:49,146 --> 02:12:53,079
that's let you acquire
Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin.

2634
02:12:53,079 --> 02:12:55,792
There are other applications

2635
02:12:55,792 --> 02:12:58,488
that let you acquire but not withdraw it.

2636
02:12:58,488 --> 02:13:01,707
And they don't get the same market share,

2637
02:13:01,707 --> 02:13:05,014
but they might give you
some other advantage.

2638
02:13:05,014 --> 02:13:09,067
There are certain layer threes
like Jack Dorsey's Cash App

2639
02:13:09,067 --> 02:13:11,546
where they just incorporated Lightning

2640
02:13:11,546 --> 02:13:13,629
and implementation of it.

2641
02:13:14,971 --> 02:13:16,984
- Into Cash App.

2642
02:13:16,984 --> 02:13:19,750
- So that makes it more,
that makes it advantageous

2643
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:24,750
versus an application that
doesn't incorporate Lightning.

2644
02:13:25,278 --> 02:13:27,836
If you think about the big picture,

2645
02:13:27,836 --> 02:13:29,752
the big picture is 8 billion people

2646
02:13:29,752 --> 02:13:33,470
with mobile phones served
a hundred million companies

2647
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:36,720
doing billions of transactions an hour.

2648
02:13:39,038 --> 02:13:42,182
And the companies are
settling with each other

2649
02:13:42,182 --> 02:13:46,922
on the base layer in blocks
of 80 million at a time.

2650
02:13:46,922 --> 02:13:48,599
And then the companies are trading

2651
02:13:48,599 --> 02:13:51,027
with the consumers, right,

2652
02:13:51,027 --> 02:13:54,277
in proprietary layers like layer three.

2653
02:13:56,097 --> 02:13:59,822
And then on occasion,
people are shuffling assets

2654
02:13:59,822 --> 02:14:03,217
across custodians with
Lightning layer two,

2655
02:14:03,216 --> 02:14:06,238
because you don't wanna
pay $5 to move $50.

2656
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:10,770
You want to pay a 20th
of a penny to move $50.

2657
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:15,770
And so all of these things
create efficiency in the economy.

2658
02:14:16,868 --> 02:14:19,688
And, Lex, if you wanna
consider how much efficiency.

2659
02:14:19,689 --> 02:14:22,686
If you gave me a billion
dollars in 20 years,

2660
02:14:22,686 --> 02:14:25,802
I couldn't find a way to
trade with another company

2661
02:14:25,802 --> 02:14:28,220
or a counterparty in Nigeria.

2662
02:14:29,422 --> 02:14:32,056
Like no amount of money.

2663
02:14:32,056 --> 02:14:35,565
Gimme $10 billion, I couldn't do it.

2664
02:14:35,565 --> 02:14:38,673
Because you get shut down
at the banking level.

2665
02:14:38,673 --> 02:14:42,662
You can't link up a bank in
Nigeria with the bank in the US.

2666
02:14:42,662 --> 02:14:45,541
You get shut down at
this credit card level

2667
02:14:45,542 --> 02:14:46,969
because they don't have the credit card,

2668
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:48,760
so they won't clear.

2669
02:14:48,760 --> 02:14:52,927
You'll get shut down at
the compliance FCPA level,

2670
02:14:54,637 --> 02:14:59,020
because you wouldn't be
able to implement a system

2671
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:01,378
that interfaced with
somebody else's system

2672
02:15:01,378 --> 02:15:04,617
if it's not in the right
political jurisdiction.

2673
02:15:04,618 --> 02:15:07,284
On the other hand, three
entrepreneurs in Nigeria

2674
02:15:07,283 --> 02:15:09,598
on the weekend could create a website

2675
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,755
that would trade in this Lightning economy

2676
02:15:12,755 --> 02:15:16,782
using open protocols without
asking anybody's permission.

2677
02:15:16,782 --> 02:15:18,002
So you're talking about something

2678
02:15:18,002 --> 02:15:21,731
that's like a million times
cheaper, less friction

2679
02:15:21,730 --> 02:15:25,980
and faster to do it if you
wanna get money to move.

2680
02:15:28,005 --> 02:15:29,585
- What do you think that looks like?

2681
02:15:29,585 --> 02:15:31,503
So that now there's a
war going on in Ukraine,

2682
02:15:31,503 --> 02:15:35,663
there's other wars, Yemen,
going out throughout the world.

2683
02:15:35,663 --> 02:15:40,413
In this most difficult of
states than a nation can be in,

2684
02:15:42,532 --> 02:15:46,863
which is at war, civil war
or war with other nations,

2685
02:15:46,863 --> 02:15:50,445
what's the role of
Bitcoin in this context?

2686
02:15:52,193 --> 02:15:55,443
- I mean, Bitcoin's a universal
trust protocol, right?

2687
02:15:55,443 --> 02:15:58,828
A universal energy protocol, if you will.

2688
02:15:58,828 --> 02:16:01,028
English is one, okay.

2689
02:16:01,028 --> 02:16:04,807
What I see is a bunch of
fragmentation of applications.

2690
02:16:04,806 --> 02:16:07,961
For example, the Russian payment app

2691
02:16:07,961 --> 02:16:09,847
is not gonna work in Ukraine.

2692
02:16:09,847 --> 02:16:12,336
The Ukraine payment app is
not gonna work in Russia.

2693
02:16:12,337 --> 02:16:14,802
The US payment apps won't work either

2694
02:16:14,801 --> 02:16:17,551
of those places as far as I know.

2695
02:16:18,842 --> 02:16:21,170
And in Argentina, their payment app

2696
02:16:21,170 --> 02:16:24,182
may not work in certain parts of Africa.

2697
02:16:24,182 --> 02:16:27,932
So what you have is
different local economies

2698
02:16:29,735 --> 02:16:33,132
where people spin up their
own applications compliant

2699
02:16:33,132 --> 02:16:37,882
with their own local laws or
in war zones, not compliant,

2700
02:16:39,165 --> 02:16:42,185
but just spinning up, you know?

2701
02:16:42,184 --> 02:16:44,826
- So, how do you build
something that's not compliant?

2702
02:16:44,826 --> 02:16:48,684
What is the revolutionary
act here when you don't agree

2703
02:16:48,684 --> 02:16:51,704
with the government or what you want

2704
02:16:51,704 --> 02:16:53,189
to free yourself from the?

2705
02:16:53,189 --> 02:16:54,648
So, here's the thing.

2706
02:16:54,648 --> 02:16:57,231
When a nation is really at war,

2707
02:16:58,769 --> 02:17:01,967
especially if it's an
authoritarian regime,

2708
02:17:01,967 --> 02:17:04,960
it's going to try to control
the, like lock everything down.

2709
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:06,675
- [Michael] Yeah.
- The spread of information.

2710
02:17:06,675 --> 02:17:08,104
How do you break through that?

2711
02:17:08,104 --> 02:17:09,402
Do you do the thing that you mentioned,

2712
02:17:09,402 --> 02:17:12,261
which is you have to build
another app essentially

2713
02:17:12,261 --> 02:17:14,807
that allows you the flow of money

2714
02:17:14,807 --> 02:17:17,110
outside the legal constraints

2715
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:18,495
placed on you by the government.

2716
02:17:18,495 --> 02:17:20,828
So, basically break the law.

2717
02:17:22,807 --> 02:17:23,994
- Metaphorically speaking,

2718
02:17:23,994 --> 02:17:26,257
if you wanna break outta the
constraints of your culture,

2719
02:17:26,256 --> 02:17:28,310
you learn to speak English.

2720
02:17:28,310 --> 02:17:30,311
For example, it's not
illegal to speak English,

2721
02:17:30,311 --> 02:17:32,715
or even if it is, right, doesn't matter.

2722
02:17:32,715 --> 02:17:35,385
But English works everywhere in the world

2723
02:17:35,385 --> 02:17:38,148
if you can speak it, and
then you can tap into

2724
02:17:38,147 --> 02:17:42,052
a global commerce and
intelligence network.

2725
02:17:42,052 --> 02:17:45,629
So Bitcoin is a language, so
you learn to speak Bitcoin

2726
02:17:45,629 --> 02:17:47,525
or you learn to speak Lightning,

2727
02:17:47,525 --> 02:17:49,263
and then you tap into that network

2728
02:17:49,263 --> 02:17:51,513
in whatever manner you can.

2729
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:54,934
- But the problem is,
it's still very difficult

2730
02:17:54,933 --> 02:17:59,933
to move Bitcoin around in Russia
and Ukraine now during war.

2731
02:18:00,045 --> 02:18:02,063
And there was a sense to me

2732
02:18:02,063 --> 02:18:04,703
that the cryptocurrency in general

2733
02:18:04,703 --> 02:18:07,576
could be the savior for helping people.

2734
02:18:07,576 --> 02:18:11,262
There's millions of refugees,
they're moving all around.

2735
02:18:11,263 --> 02:18:14,596
It's very difficult to move money around

2736
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:18,653
in that space to help people.

2737
02:18:18,653 --> 02:18:20,862
- I think we're very early.

2738
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:22,705
Like we're very embryonic here.

2739
02:18:22,706 --> 02:18:24,742
If you look at the-
- Who's we, sorry.

2740
02:18:24,742 --> 02:18:26,047
We as a human civilization

2741
02:18:26,047 --> 02:18:28,501
or we operating in the
cryptocurrency space?

2742
02:18:28,501 --> 02:18:32,958
- I think the entire crypto
economy is very embryonic

2743
02:18:32,958 --> 02:18:36,778
and the human races
adoption of it is embryonic.

2744
02:18:36,778 --> 02:18:40,861
We're like one, 2% down
that adoption curve.

2745
02:18:41,884 --> 02:18:43,868
If you take Lightning, for example,

2746
02:18:43,868 --> 02:18:46,457
the first real commercial applications

2747
02:18:46,457 --> 02:18:48,694
of Lightning are just
in the last 12 months.

2748
02:18:48,694 --> 02:18:50,903
- [Lex] Yeah.
- So, we're like year one.

2749
02:18:50,903 --> 02:18:53,237
We might be approaching year two

2750
02:18:53,237 --> 02:18:54,903
of commercial Lightning adoption.

2751
02:18:54,904 --> 02:18:56,283
And if you look at Lightning adoption,

2752
02:18:56,282 --> 02:18:59,282
Lightning's not built into Coinbase,

2753
02:19:00,156 --> 02:19:04,213
it's not built into Binance,
it's not built into FTX.

2754
02:19:04,212 --> 02:19:08,074
Cash App just implemented
the first implementation,

2755
02:19:08,075 --> 02:19:10,061
but not all the features
are built into it.

2756
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:13,227
There's a few dozen, a
dozen Lightning wallets

2757
02:19:13,227 --> 02:19:15,527
circulating out there.

2758
02:19:15,527 --> 02:19:19,298
So, I think that we're
probably gonna be 36 months

2759
02:19:19,298 --> 02:19:22,298
of software development at the point

2760
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:26,647
that every Android phone and every iPhone

2761
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:33,500
has a Bitcoin wallet or a
crypto wallet in it of sorts.

2762
02:19:33,751 --> 02:19:34,584
That's a big deal.

2763
02:19:34,584 --> 02:19:38,377
If Apple embraced Lightning,
that's a big deal.

2764
02:19:38,377 --> 02:19:43,377
- So the adoption is the thing,
like in a war zone adoption,

2765
02:19:44,550 --> 02:19:47,522
the people who struggle
the most in war are people

2766
02:19:47,522 --> 02:19:51,572
who weren't doing that great
before the war started.

2767
02:19:51,573 --> 02:19:52,902
They don't have the
technological sophistication.

2768
02:19:52,902 --> 02:19:53,735
- [Michael] Sure.

2769
02:19:53,735 --> 02:19:57,467
- The hackers and all those
kinds of people will find a way.

2770
02:19:57,467 --> 02:19:59,452
It's just regular people
who are just struggling

2771
02:19:59,451 --> 02:20:02,173
to make day by day living.

2772
02:20:02,174 --> 02:20:05,880
And so if the adoption
permeates the entire culture,

2773
02:20:05,879 --> 02:20:07,342
then you can start to move money

2774
02:20:07,343 --> 02:20:09,676
around in the digital space.

2775
02:20:14,117 --> 02:20:17,860
If you can psychoanalyze
Jack Dorsey for a second.

2776
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:19,386
So he's one of the early adopters,

2777
02:20:19,386 --> 02:20:21,802
or he's one of the people
pushing the early adoption,

2778
02:20:21,802 --> 02:20:25,645
this layer three, so inside Cash App.

2779
02:20:25,645 --> 02:20:28,051
What do you make of the man

2780
02:20:28,050 --> 02:20:31,595
of this decision as a business owner,

2781
02:20:31,595 --> 02:20:34,492
as somebody playing in the space?

2782
02:20:34,492 --> 02:20:38,742
Why did he do it and what
does that mean for others

2783
02:20:39,993 --> 02:20:42,180
at this scale that
might be doing the same?

2784
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,376
So incorporating Lightning Networking,

2785
02:20:44,376 --> 02:20:46,823
incorporating Bitcoin into their products.

2786
02:20:46,823 --> 02:20:49,859
- I think he's been
pretty clear about this.

2787
02:20:49,859 --> 02:20:51,477
He feels that Bitcoin is an instrument

2788
02:20:51,477 --> 02:20:54,517
of economic empowerment
for billions of people

2789
02:20:54,516 --> 02:20:59,516
that are unbanked and have no
property rights in the world.

2790
02:20:59,977 --> 02:21:03,394
If you want to give an incorruptible bank

2791
02:21:07,770 --> 02:21:10,603
to 8 billion people on the planet,

2792
02:21:13,076 --> 02:21:15,435
that's the same as asking the question,

2793
02:21:15,435 --> 02:21:18,102
how do you give a full education

2794
02:21:19,406 --> 02:21:22,999
through PhD to 8 billion
people on the planet?

2795
02:21:22,998 --> 02:21:25,915
And the answer is a digital version

2796
02:21:26,983 --> 02:21:30,832
of the 20th century thing,
running on a mobile phone.

2797
02:21:30,832 --> 02:21:32,614
And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace.

2798
02:21:32,614 --> 02:21:34,462
It's run by incorruptible software

2799
02:21:34,462 --> 02:21:36,663
and it's for everybody on earth.

2800
02:21:36,664 --> 02:21:38,207
So I think when Jack looks at it,

2801
02:21:38,207 --> 02:21:41,923
he's very sensitive to the
plight of everybody in Africa.

2802
02:21:41,923 --> 02:21:43,077
If you look at Africans, right,

2803
02:21:43,076 --> 02:21:44,400
like you're gonna give them banks,

2804
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,417
you're not gonna put a bank
branch on every corner.

2805
02:21:46,417 --> 02:21:48,461
That's an obscene waste of energy.

2806
02:21:48,461 --> 02:21:51,059
You're not gonna run copper
wires across the continent.

2807
02:21:51,059 --> 02:21:53,984
That's an obscene waste of energy.

2808
02:21:53,984 --> 02:21:56,650
You're not gonna give them gold.

2809
02:21:57,977 --> 02:22:01,342
And so, how are you going to provide

2810
02:22:01,343 --> 02:22:03,983
people with a decent life?

2811
02:22:03,983 --> 02:22:06,301
The metaphor I think is relevant here.

2812
02:22:06,301 --> 02:22:10,706
The biological metaphor,
Lex, is a type one diabetic.

2813
02:22:10,706 --> 02:22:13,394
If you're a type one
diabetic, you can't form fat.

2814
02:22:13,394 --> 02:22:14,595
And if you can't form fat,

2815
02:22:14,595 --> 02:22:17,144
then you can't store excess energy.

2816
02:22:17,144 --> 02:22:19,743
So that means that, I mean,

2817
02:22:19,743 --> 02:22:21,765
fat is the ultimate organic battery,

2818
02:22:21,764 --> 02:22:23,110
and if you've got 30 pounds of it,

2819
02:22:23,111 --> 02:22:25,743
you can go 60 days without eating.

2820
02:22:25,743 --> 02:22:29,676
But if you can't generate
insulin, you can't form fat cells.

2821
02:22:29,676 --> 02:22:32,622
And if you can't form fat
cells and store energy,

2822
02:22:32,622 --> 02:22:34,859
then you can eat yourself to death.

2823
02:22:34,859 --> 02:22:36,900
I mean, you will eat and you will die.

2824
02:22:36,900 --> 02:22:38,307
You'll starve to death.

2825
02:22:38,307 --> 02:22:40,891
So the lack of property rights

2826
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:43,703
is like being a type one diabetic.

2827
02:22:43,703 --> 02:22:48,344
And so if you look at most
people everywhere in the world,

2828
02:22:48,344 --> 02:22:50,534
they don't have property rights,

2829
02:22:50,534 --> 02:22:53,518
they don't have effective bank,

2830
02:22:53,518 --> 02:22:56,242
and their currency is broken.

2831
02:22:56,242 --> 02:22:58,653
Like what are the two
things that in theory

2832
02:22:58,653 --> 02:23:02,903
would serve as the equivalent
of an organic battery

2833
02:23:04,081 --> 02:23:06,209
or an economic battery to civilization?

2834
02:23:06,209 --> 02:23:09,337
It would be, I have a
currency which holds its value

2835
02:23:09,336 --> 02:23:11,768
and I can store it in a bank.

2836
02:23:11,768 --> 02:23:14,768
So, a risk-free currency derivative.

2837
02:23:18,896 --> 02:23:21,655
I pay you your money, you
take your life savings,

2838
02:23:21,655 --> 02:23:24,346
you put it in a bank, you
save up for your retirement,

2839
02:23:24,346 --> 02:23:25,844
you'll have happily ever after.

2840
02:23:25,844 --> 02:23:28,358
That's the American dream, right?

2841
02:23:28,358 --> 02:23:31,201
That's the idyllic situation.

2842
02:23:31,201 --> 02:23:34,325
The real situation is there are no banks.

2843
02:23:34,325 --> 02:23:36,009
You can't get a bank account.

2844
02:23:36,010 --> 02:23:39,388
So I give you your pay in currency

2845
02:23:39,388 --> 02:23:42,770
and then I double the supply
and I give it to my cousin,

2846
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:44,653
or I give it to whatever cause I want,

2847
02:23:44,653 --> 02:23:46,195
or I use it to buy weapons.

2848
02:23:46,195 --> 02:23:49,074
And then you find a loaf of
bread cost triple next month

2849
02:23:49,074 --> 02:23:53,559
is what it costs, and your
life savings is worthless.

2850
02:23:53,558 --> 02:23:56,360
And so in that environment,
everybody's ripped back

2851
02:23:56,361 --> 02:23:58,689
to stone age barter.

2852
02:23:58,689 --> 02:24:01,179
And the problem with that,
even stone age barter

2853
02:24:01,179 --> 02:24:04,201
is you're gonna carry your
life savings on your back.

2854
02:24:04,201 --> 02:24:05,608
And what happens when the
guy with a machine gun

2855
02:24:05,609 --> 02:24:09,448
points it at your head and
just takes your life savings?

2856
02:24:09,448 --> 02:24:11,703
So, I think from Jack's point of view,

2857
02:24:11,703 --> 02:24:15,726
he thinks that life is,
this is maybe too strong,

2858
02:24:15,726 --> 02:24:16,610
but these are my words,

2859
02:24:16,610 --> 02:24:19,990
life is hopeless for a lot of people.

2860
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:22,532
And Bitcoin is hope, right?

2861
02:24:22,532 --> 02:24:27,032
Because it gives everyone
an engineered monetary asset

2862
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,436
that's a bearer instrument,

2863
02:24:32,435 --> 02:24:36,228
and it gives them a bank
on their mobile phone

2864
02:24:36,228 --> 02:24:40,288
and they don't have to
trust their government

2865
02:24:40,289 --> 02:24:44,122
or another counterparty
with their life force.

2866
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:51,101
So there's a secondary thing
I think he's in interested in,

2867
02:24:51,101 --> 02:24:54,409
which is the first thing
is the human rights issue.

2868
02:24:54,408 --> 02:24:58,200
And the second thing would be the friction

2869
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:01,700
to trade cross borders is so great, right?

2870
02:25:03,051 --> 02:25:04,135
- [Lex] Yeah.

2871
02:25:06,236 --> 02:25:10,581
- You like AI, so I'll give
you a beautiful notion.

2872
02:25:10,582 --> 02:25:14,386
Maybe one day there'll be
an artificially intelligent

2873
02:25:14,386 --> 02:25:19,052
creature in cyberspace that
is self-sufficient and rich.

2874
02:25:21,331 --> 02:25:24,019
- Like that, it would've
sovereignty, you mean.

2875
02:25:24,019 --> 02:25:27,019
- Can a robot own money or property?

2876
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,034
How about, can a Tesla car?

2877
02:25:31,034 --> 02:25:33,930
Can I actually put enough money in a car

2878
02:25:33,930 --> 02:25:36,788
for it to drive itself and
maintain itself forever?

2879
02:25:36,788 --> 02:25:40,082
Or can I create an artificially
intelligent creature

2880
02:25:40,082 --> 02:25:43,390
in cyberspace that is endowed such

2881
02:25:43,389 --> 02:25:45,417
that it would live a thousand years

2882
02:25:45,417 --> 02:25:48,492
and continue to do its job, right?

2883
02:25:48,492 --> 02:25:51,829
We have a word for that in
the real world is institution.

2884
02:25:51,829 --> 02:25:54,588
Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford, right?

2885
02:25:54,588 --> 02:25:56,245
There are institutions with endowments

2886
02:25:56,245 --> 02:25:58,328
that go on in perpetuity.

2887
02:25:59,275 --> 02:26:03,775
But what if I wanted to
perpetuate a software program?

2888
02:26:05,259 --> 02:26:08,675
And with something like digital property,

2889
02:26:09,827 --> 02:26:13,773
with Bitcoin and
Lightning, you could do it.

2890
02:26:13,773 --> 02:26:16,523
And on the other hand, with banks

2891
02:26:17,959 --> 02:26:21,126
and credit cards, you couldn't, right?

2892
02:26:22,538 --> 02:26:24,997
You couldn't ever, so
you can create things

2893
02:26:24,997 --> 02:26:27,581
that are beautiful and lasting.

2894
02:26:29,574 --> 02:26:31,593
And what's the difference in speed?

2895
02:26:31,593 --> 02:26:34,684
Well, it's, so I can either trade

2896
02:26:34,683 --> 02:26:38,893
with everybody in the world
at the speed of light,

2897
02:26:38,894 --> 02:26:42,735
friction free in 24 hours
writing a Python script,

2898
02:26:42,735 --> 02:26:46,886
or I can spend a hundred
billion dollars to trade

2899
02:26:46,886 --> 02:26:49,614
with a few million people in the world

2900
02:26:49,614 --> 02:26:53,396
after it takes them six
months of application.

2901
02:26:53,396 --> 02:26:56,229
The impedance is like a 10 million

2902
02:26:57,075 --> 02:26:59,790
to one difference, right?

2903
02:26:59,790 --> 02:27:02,342
And the metaphors are literally
like launching something

2904
02:27:02,342 --> 02:27:07,092
in orbit versus almost orbit
or vacuum sealing something.

2905
02:27:08,253 --> 02:27:10,810
Does it last forever and
does it orbit forever,

2906
02:27:10,809 --> 02:27:14,528
or does it go up and come
down and burn up, right?

2907
02:27:14,528 --> 02:27:17,028
And I think Jack is interested

2908
02:27:18,147 --> 02:27:21,064
in putting freedom in orbit, right?

2909
02:27:22,059 --> 02:27:23,739
- (chuckles) Putting freedom.

2910
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:24,754
- Putting freedom in orbit.

2911
02:27:24,754 --> 02:27:27,527
And he said it many times, he said,

2912
02:27:27,528 --> 02:27:29,597
"The internet needs a native currency,"

2913
02:27:29,597 --> 02:27:30,920
right?
- [Lex] Yeah.

2914
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:34,253
- And no political construct or security

2915
02:27:35,889 --> 02:27:37,769
can be a native currency.

2916
02:27:37,770 --> 02:27:39,727
You need a property
and you need a property

2917
02:27:39,727 --> 02:27:42,755
that can be moved a
million times a second.

2918
02:27:42,754 --> 02:27:47,426
Can you oscillate it at 10
kilohertz or a hundred kilohertz?

2919
02:27:47,426 --> 02:27:51,336
And the answer is only
if it's a pure digital

2920
02:27:51,336 --> 02:27:54,253
construct, permissionless and open.

2921
02:27:55,531 --> 02:27:58,945
And so I think that he's
enthusiastic as the technologist

2922
02:27:58,945 --> 02:28:03,003
and he is enthusiastic
as the humanitarian.

2923
02:28:03,003 --> 02:28:06,402
And what he's doing is to
support both those areas.

2924
02:28:06,402 --> 02:28:08,915
He's supporting the Bitcoin
and the Lightning protocol

2925
02:28:08,915 --> 02:28:10,135
by building them into his products,

2926
02:28:10,136 --> 02:28:13,058
but he is also building the applications

2927
02:28:13,058 --> 02:28:15,918
which you need at the Cash App level

2928
02:28:15,917 --> 02:28:19,759
in order to commercialize
and deliver the functionality

2929
02:28:19,759 --> 02:28:21,247
and the compliance necessary.

2930
02:28:21,247 --> 02:28:22,914
And they're related.

2931
02:28:24,093 --> 02:28:27,936
- And I should also say he's
just a fascinating person.

2932
02:28:27,936 --> 02:28:31,947
For a random reason that
I couldn't even explain

2933
02:28:31,947 --> 02:28:34,947
if I tried, I met him a few days ago

2934
02:28:36,024 --> 02:28:38,610
and gave him a great big hug
in the middle of nowhere.

2935
02:28:38,611 --> 02:28:40,418
There was no explanation.

2936
02:28:40,417 --> 02:28:41,895
He just appeared.

2937
02:28:41,895 --> 02:28:45,072
That's a fascinating human,
his relationship with art,

2938
02:28:45,072 --> 02:28:47,359
with the world, with human suffering,

2939
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:50,386
with technology is fascinating.

2940
02:28:50,386 --> 02:28:54,078
I don't know what his path looks like,

2941
02:28:54,078 --> 02:28:57,360
but it's interesting that
people like that exist.

2942
02:28:57,361 --> 02:28:59,587
And in part I'm saddened that he no longer

2943
02:28:59,586 --> 02:29:03,170
is involved with Twitter
directly as a CEO,

2944
02:29:04,097 --> 02:29:06,367
because I was hoping
something inside Twitter

2945
02:29:06,367 --> 02:29:09,917
would also integrate some of these ideas

2946
02:29:09,917 --> 02:29:13,001
of what you're calling digital energy

2947
02:29:14,120 --> 02:29:15,674
to see how social networks,

2948
02:29:15,674 --> 02:29:17,545
something I'm really interested in

2949
02:29:17,545 --> 02:29:19,618
and passionate about could be transformed.

2950
02:29:19,618 --> 02:29:24,618
Let me ask you just for
educational purposes. (chuckles)

2951
02:29:25,868 --> 02:29:28,140
Can you please explain to me what Web3

2952
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:31,870
and the beef between Jack and
Marc Andreesen is exactly?

2953
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:33,554
Did you see what happened?

2954
02:29:33,554 --> 02:29:36,814
Sorry to have you analyze
Twitter like it's Shakespeare,

2955
02:29:36,814 --> 02:29:39,253
but can you please explain to me

2956
02:29:39,253 --> 02:29:43,193
why there was any drama over this topic?

2957
02:29:43,192 --> 02:29:46,452
- First of all, Web3 is a term that's used

2958
02:29:46,452 --> 02:29:51,202
to refer to the part of the
economy that's token finance.

2959
02:29:52,361 --> 02:29:55,405
So if I'm launching an
application and my ideas to

2960
02:29:55,406 --> 02:29:59,218
is to create a token
along with the application

2961
02:29:59,218 --> 02:30:01,050
and issue the token to the community

2962
02:30:01,049 --> 02:30:05,307
so as to finance the application
and build support for it.

2963
02:30:05,308 --> 02:30:10,308
I think that that's the most
common interpretation of Web3.

2964
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:12,459
There are other interpretation too,

2965
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:14,904
so I'm just gonna refer to that one.

2966
02:30:14,905 --> 02:30:18,525
And I think the beef in a
nutshell, not articulated,

2967
02:30:18,525 --> 02:30:22,084
but I'll articulate it, is whether or not

2968
02:30:22,084 --> 02:30:24,978
you should focus all your
energy creating applications

2969
02:30:24,978 --> 02:30:28,590
on top of an ethical digital
property like Bitcoin

2970
02:30:28,591 --> 02:30:33,507
or whether you should attempt
to create a competitor to it,

2971
02:30:34,756 --> 02:30:37,340
which generally would be deemed

2972
02:30:38,458 --> 02:30:40,939
as a security by the Bitcoin community.

2973
02:30:40,939 --> 02:30:42,914
So, I'm gonna put on my Bitcoin hat here,

2974
02:30:42,914 --> 02:30:44,101
right?
- Yeah.

2975
02:30:44,101 --> 02:30:45,490
- All the tokens that are being,

2976
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:47,190
if it's driven by a venture capitalist,

2977
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:48,505
well, it's a security.

2978
02:30:48,504 --> 02:30:51,165
If there's a CEO and a
CTO, it's a security.

2979
02:30:51,165 --> 02:30:54,086
All these projects, they're companies.

2980
02:30:54,086 --> 02:30:56,118
Foundations are companies, right?

2981
02:30:56,118 --> 02:30:58,615
If you call them a
project or a foundation,

2982
02:30:58,615 --> 02:31:01,174
it doesn't make it not a security.

2983
02:31:01,174 --> 02:31:04,812
They're all, in essence,
collections of individuals

2984
02:31:04,811 --> 02:31:09,369
that are issuing equity
in the form of a token.

2985
02:31:09,369 --> 02:31:13,952
And if there's a pre mine,
an IPO, an ICO, a foundation

2986
02:31:17,484 --> 02:31:22,484
or any kind of protocol where
there's a group of engineers

2987
02:31:22,854 --> 02:31:27,521
that have influence over it,
then to a securities lawyer

2988
02:31:28,570 --> 02:31:32,155
or to most Bitcoiners
and definitely to anybody

2989
02:31:32,156 --> 02:31:34,513
that's steeped in securities
law, you look at and say,

2990
02:31:34,513 --> 02:31:37,073
"Well, that passes the Howie test."

2991
02:31:37,073 --> 02:31:40,497
It looks like a security,
it should be sold

2992
02:31:40,497 --> 02:31:44,914
to the public pursuant to
disclosures and regulations

2993
02:31:46,363 --> 02:31:50,275
and you're just ducking
the IPO process, right?

2994
02:31:50,275 --> 02:31:54,147
And so, now we get back
to the ethical issue.

2995
02:31:54,147 --> 02:31:58,139
Well, the ethical issue
is if you're trading it

2996
02:31:58,139 --> 02:32:01,680
as a commodity and
representing it as a commodity,

2997
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:03,897
while truthfully it's a security,

2998
02:32:03,897 --> 02:32:05,617
then it's a violation of ethics rules

2999
02:32:05,617 --> 02:32:07,550
and it's probably illegal.

3000
02:32:07,549 --> 02:32:08,943
- Well, you keep leaning on this.

3001
02:32:08,943 --> 02:32:09,981
Let me push back on that part.

3002
02:32:09,981 --> 02:32:11,435
- [Michael] Yeah.
- Maybe you can educate me.

3003
02:32:11,435 --> 02:32:14,539
But you keep leaning on
this line of securities law

3004
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:18,040
as if it, with all due respect to lawyers,

3005
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:24,110
as if that line somehow defines
what is and isn't ethical.

3006
02:32:24,701 --> 02:32:27,895
I think there's a lot of
correlation as you've discussed,

3007
02:32:27,896 --> 02:32:31,661
but I'd like to leave the line aside.

3008
02:32:31,661 --> 02:32:34,063
If the law calls something a security,

3009
02:32:34,063 --> 02:32:38,985
it doesn't mean in my eyes
that it's is unethical.

3010
02:32:38,985 --> 02:32:41,998
I mean, there could be some
technicalities and lawyers

3011
02:32:41,998 --> 02:32:44,296
and people play games with this
kind of stuff all the time.

3012
02:32:44,296 --> 02:32:47,653
But I take your bigger
point that if there's a CEO,

3013
02:32:47,653 --> 02:32:50,153
there's a project lead
that's fundamentally,

3014
02:32:50,153 --> 02:32:52,202
well, that to you is
fundamentally different

3015
02:32:52,201 --> 02:32:55,056
than the structure of Bitcoin.

3016
02:32:55,057 --> 02:32:57,433
- It's not that creating
securities is unethical.

3017
02:32:57,433 --> 02:32:58,608
I created a security.

3018
02:32:58,608 --> 02:33:01,050
I took a company public, right?

3019
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:02,576
That's not the unethical part.

3020
02:33:02,576 --> 02:33:05,497
It's completely ethical
to create securities.

3021
02:33:05,497 --> 02:33:08,108
Block is a security, all
companies are securities.

3022
02:33:08,108 --> 02:33:11,144
The unethical part is to
represent it as property

3023
02:33:11,144 --> 02:33:16,060
when it's a security and to
promote it or trade it as such.

3024
02:33:17,290 --> 02:33:21,230
- This whole promotion,
that's also a technical thing.

3025
02:33:21,229 --> 02:33:25,572
'cause like what counts
as not as promotion

3026
02:33:25,572 --> 02:33:28,147
is a legal thing and you get in trouble

3027
02:33:28,147 --> 02:33:32,420
for all these things, but that
the game that lawyers play.

3028
02:33:32,420 --> 02:33:33,613
There's an ethical thing here,

3029
02:33:33,613 --> 02:33:37,363
which is like what's
right to promote or not.

3030
02:33:38,353 --> 02:33:41,463
To me, propaganda is unethical,

3031
02:33:41,463 --> 02:33:45,092
but it's usually not illegal. (chuckles)

3032
02:33:45,092 --> 02:33:48,916
- You roll the clock back 20 years, right?

3033
02:33:48,915 --> 02:33:51,010
All the boiler room pump and dump schemes

3034
02:33:51,011 --> 02:33:53,430
were all about someone
pitching a penny stock.

3035
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:54,263
- [Lex] Sure.

3036
02:33:54,263 --> 02:33:57,309
- Selling swamp land in Florida.

3037
02:33:57,308 --> 02:33:59,623
And if you roll the clock
back forward 20 years,

3038
02:33:59,623 --> 02:34:02,421
and I create my own company

3039
02:34:02,421 --> 02:34:03,880
and I represented it as the same thing

3040
02:34:03,879 --> 02:34:05,963
and I don't make the disclosures, right?

3041
02:34:05,963 --> 02:34:10,710
You're just one step removed
from the boiler room scheme.

3042
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:11,543
- [Lex] Yeah.

3043
02:34:11,543 --> 02:34:14,273
- And that's what's distasteful about it.

3044
02:34:14,273 --> 02:34:16,346
There are ways to sell
securities to the public,

3045
02:34:16,346 --> 02:34:18,994
but there are expectations.

3046
02:34:18,995 --> 02:34:22,838
Maybe we could forget about
whether the security laws

3047
02:34:22,837 --> 02:34:24,533
are ethical or not, right?

3048
02:34:24,533 --> 02:34:26,346
I will leave that alone.

3049
02:34:26,346 --> 02:34:30,029
We'll just start with the
Biblical definition of ethics.

3050
02:34:30,029 --> 02:34:32,166
- [Lex] Yes.
- Don't lie, cheat or steal.

3051
02:34:32,165 --> 02:34:34,855
So if I'm going to sell something to you,

3052
02:34:34,855 --> 02:34:38,511
I need to fully disclose what
I'm selling to you, right?

3053
02:34:38,511 --> 02:34:42,344
And that's a matter of
great debate right now.

3054
02:34:44,709 --> 02:34:47,664
And so I think that
that's part of the debate.

3055
02:34:47,664 --> 02:34:48,826
But the other part of the debate

3056
02:34:48,825 --> 02:34:52,658
is whether or not we
need more than one token.

3057
02:34:54,833 --> 02:34:57,583
Like we need at least one, right?

3058
02:34:58,835 --> 02:34:59,668
- [Lex] Yes.

3059
02:34:59,668 --> 02:35:01,949
- We need at least one digital property.

3060
02:35:01,949 --> 02:35:02,796
- [Lex] One is better than zero.

3061
02:35:02,796 --> 02:35:05,765
- Because zero means there
is no digital economy.

3062
02:35:05,765 --> 02:35:06,599
- [Lex] Yes.

3063
02:35:06,599 --> 02:35:10,434
- And by the way, the
conventional view of maximalist

3064
02:35:10,434 --> 02:35:12,861
is they think there's only
one and everything else isn't.

3065
02:35:12,861 --> 02:35:15,063
That's not the point I'm gonna make.

3066
02:35:15,064 --> 02:35:19,822
I would say we know there is
at least one digital property,

3067
02:35:19,822 --> 02:35:22,180
and that is Bitcoin.

3068
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:25,220
If you can create a truly decentralized

3069
02:35:25,220 --> 02:35:27,804
non-custodial bearer instrument

3070
02:35:30,692 --> 02:35:32,833
that is not under the control

3071
02:35:32,834 --> 02:35:36,942
of any organization that
is fairly distributed,

3072
02:35:36,941 --> 02:35:39,974
then you might create another or multiple.

3073
02:35:39,975 --> 02:35:42,443
And there may be others out there.

3074
02:35:42,442 --> 02:35:46,692
But I think that the
frustration of a lot of people

3075
02:35:49,394 --> 02:35:51,979
in the Bitcoin community
and I share this with Jack,

3076
02:35:51,979 --> 02:35:55,524
is we could create a hundred
trillion dollars of value

3077
02:35:55,524 --> 02:35:58,111
in the real world simply
by building applications

3078
02:35:58,111 --> 02:36:00,944
on top of Bitcoin as a foundation.

3079
02:36:02,861 --> 02:36:06,094
And so continually trying
to reinvent the wheel

3080
02:36:06,093 --> 02:36:10,843
and create competitive things
is a massive waste of time.

3081
02:36:15,129 --> 02:36:18,379
And it's diversion of human creativity.

3082
02:36:19,665 --> 02:36:22,627
It's like we have an ethical good thing.

3083
02:36:22,627 --> 02:36:23,525
- [Lex] Yeah.

3084
02:36:23,525 --> 02:36:25,796
- And now we're going to try to create

3085
02:36:25,796 --> 02:36:28,515
a third or a fourth one.

3086
02:36:28,515 --> 02:36:29,475
Why?

3087
02:36:29,475 --> 02:36:30,695
- Well, let's talk about it.

3088
02:36:30,695 --> 02:36:31,965
So first of all, I'm with you,

3089
02:36:31,965 --> 02:36:35,023
but let me ask you this
interesting question

3090
02:36:35,023 --> 02:36:37,412
because we talked about
properties and securities.

3091
02:36:37,413 --> 02:36:39,817
Let's talk about conflict of interest.

3092
02:36:39,816 --> 02:36:42,349
So you said you could advertise public,

3093
02:36:42,350 --> 02:36:44,666
you have a popular Twitter account.

3094
02:36:44,666 --> 02:36:47,166
It's hilarious and insightful.

3095
02:36:48,951 --> 02:36:51,784
You do promote Bitcoin in a sense.

3096
02:36:52,870 --> 02:36:54,326
I don't know if you would say that.

3097
02:36:54,326 --> 02:36:57,115
But do you think there's
a conflict of interest

3098
02:36:57,115 --> 02:37:00,395
in anyone who owns
Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin?

3099
02:37:00,395 --> 02:37:04,382
Is it the same as you
promoting the farming?

3100
02:37:04,382 --> 02:37:06,362
- I would say no.

3101
02:37:06,362 --> 02:37:08,761
There's an interest.

3102
02:37:08,762 --> 02:37:12,929
I think that you can promote
a property or an idea

3103
02:37:15,568 --> 02:37:19,345
to the extent that you don't control it.

3104
02:37:19,345 --> 02:37:21,746
I think that the point at which you start

3105
02:37:21,746 --> 02:37:24,837
to have a conflict of interest

3106
02:37:24,837 --> 02:37:27,860
is when you're promoting
a proprietary product

3107
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:29,418
or proprietary security.

3108
02:37:29,417 --> 02:37:31,858
A security in general
is a proprietary asset.

3109
02:37:31,858 --> 02:37:35,395
So for example, if you look at my Twitter,

3110
02:37:35,395 --> 02:37:38,558
you'll find that I make lots
of statements about Bitcoin.

3111
02:37:38,558 --> 02:37:40,696
You won't ever see me making a statement

3112
02:37:40,695 --> 02:37:43,838
that say MicroStrategy
stock will go up forever.

3113
02:37:43,838 --> 02:37:47,825
Right, I'm not promoting a security, MSTR,

3114
02:37:47,825 --> 02:37:51,791
because at the end of the
day, MSTR is a security,

3115
02:37:51,791 --> 02:37:52,941
it is proprietary.

3116
02:37:52,941 --> 02:37:55,106
I have proprietary interest in it.

3117
02:37:55,106 --> 02:37:58,386
I have a disproportionate
amount of control

3118
02:37:58,386 --> 02:38:01,612
and influence on the direction whereas-

3119
02:38:01,611 --> 02:38:02,577
- The control is the problem.

3120
02:38:02,577 --> 02:38:03,842
The control is the problem

3121
02:38:03,843 --> 02:38:06,353
because you have interest in both.

3122
02:38:06,352 --> 02:38:09,870
You can very, if Bitcoin is a successful,

3123
02:38:09,870 --> 02:38:13,248
as we're talking about,
you are very possibly

3124
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:15,680
can become the richest human on earth

3125
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,815
given how much you own in Bitcoin, right?

3126
02:38:19,815 --> 02:38:21,430
The wealthiest, not the richest.

3127
02:38:21,430 --> 02:38:23,104
I don't know what those words mean.

3128
02:38:23,103 --> 02:38:24,653
- I would benefit economically.

3129
02:38:24,653 --> 02:38:26,693
- [Lex] Economic, you
would benefit economically.

3130
02:38:26,692 --> 02:38:27,527
- That's true.

3131
02:38:27,527 --> 02:38:30,736
- So, the reason that's
not conflict of interest

3132
02:38:30,736 --> 02:38:35,153
is because the word property,
that Bitcoin is an idea

3133
02:38:37,161 --> 02:38:38,770
and it's Bitcoin is open.

3134
02:38:38,770 --> 02:38:40,310
- [Michael] It's because I don't own it.

3135
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:42,416
- You don't.
- I don't control it.

3136
02:38:42,416 --> 02:38:45,810
In essence, the ethical line here

3137
02:38:45,810 --> 02:38:49,118
is could I print myself
10 million more Bitcoin

3138
02:38:49,118 --> 02:38:51,001
or not, right?

3139
02:38:51,001 --> 02:38:53,126
I could.
- Or can anyone, right?

3140
02:38:53,126 --> 02:38:56,043
It's not just you, it's can anyone.

3141
02:38:56,043 --> 02:38:57,829
Because can you promote somebody else's?

3142
02:38:57,829 --> 02:39:00,231
Yes, I guess you can.

3143
02:39:00,231 --> 02:39:03,895
Like can you promote Apple (chuckles)

3144
02:39:03,895 --> 02:39:05,068
when you have no stake.

3145
02:39:05,067 --> 02:39:06,715
- It's like you could
have a Twitter account

3146
02:39:06,715 --> 02:39:11,048
where you promote oil
or you promote camping

3147
02:39:11,048 --> 02:39:15,452
or you promote family values
or promote a carnivore diet

3148
02:39:15,451 --> 02:39:17,472
or promote the Iron Man, right?

3149
02:39:17,472 --> 02:39:22,168
- But you're not gonna get
wealthier if you promote camping.

3150
02:39:22,168 --> 02:39:23,730
'cause you can't own a stake in.

3151
02:39:23,730 --> 02:39:26,584
I mean, you own a lot of Bitcoin.

3152
02:39:26,584 --> 02:39:28,033
What is that?

3153
02:39:28,033 --> 02:39:32,253
Don't you own the stake
in the idea of Bitcoin?

3154
02:39:32,254 --> 02:39:34,837
- Yeah, I would grant you that.

3155
02:39:35,811 --> 02:39:39,945
- But the lack of control is
the fundamental ethical line

3156
02:39:39,945 --> 02:39:41,271
that you just, you don't have.

3157
02:39:41,271 --> 02:39:43,686
All you are is you're a fan of the idea.

3158
02:39:43,685 --> 02:39:47,854
You believe in the idea
and the power of the idea.

3159
02:39:47,854 --> 02:39:50,988
You can't take that idea away from others.

3160
02:39:50,988 --> 02:39:52,917
- Let's come back to, let me give you

3161
02:39:52,917 --> 02:39:54,568
some maybe easier examples.

3162
02:39:54,568 --> 02:39:58,568
If you were the head of
the Marine Corps, right?

3163
02:40:00,503 --> 02:40:04,441
And someone came to you and
said, I created Marine coin.

3164
02:40:04,441 --> 02:40:08,402
And the twist on Marine coin is I want you

3165
02:40:08,402 --> 02:40:12,671
to tell every Marine that
they'll get an extra Marine coin

3166
02:40:12,671 --> 02:40:15,726
when they get their next stripe.

3167
02:40:15,726 --> 02:40:16,878
And then I'm gonna give you,

3168
02:40:16,878 --> 02:40:19,201
and I'm gonna let you buy Marine coin now,

3169
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:20,693
and then after you buy Marine coin,

3170
02:40:20,693 --> 02:40:24,443
I want you to like
promote it to them, right?

3171
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:29,629
At some point, if you start to have

3172
02:40:29,629 --> 02:40:32,183
a disproportional influence on it,

3173
02:40:32,183 --> 02:40:33,965
or if you're in a conversation with people

3174
02:40:33,965 --> 02:40:36,505
with disproportionate influence
becomes conflict of interest

3175
02:40:36,505 --> 02:40:39,811
and it would make you profoundly
uncomfortable, I think.

3176
02:40:39,811 --> 02:40:40,645
- [Lex] Yeah.

3177
02:40:40,645 --> 02:40:41,665
- If the head of the Marine Corps

3178
02:40:41,665 --> 02:40:45,517
started promoting anything
that looked like a security.

3179
02:40:45,516 --> 02:40:47,323
Now if the head of the Marine Corps

3180
02:40:47,323 --> 02:40:49,573
started promoting canoeing,

3181
02:40:50,661 --> 02:40:52,039
you might think he's kind of wacky.

3182
02:40:52,039 --> 02:40:53,971
Like maybe like that's kind of

3183
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:56,720
a waste of time at a distraction.

3184
02:40:57,609 --> 02:41:02,500
But to the extent that
canoeing is not a security,

3185
02:41:02,500 --> 02:41:04,343
not a problem unless you...

3186
02:41:04,343 --> 02:41:07,746
Ultimately the issue of decentralization

3187
02:41:07,746 --> 02:41:11,002
is really a critical one.
- So not having a head.

3188
02:41:11,003 --> 02:41:14,836
So is it something, can
Bitcoin be replicated?

3189
02:41:18,387 --> 02:41:20,358
So all the things that you're saying

3190
02:41:20,358 --> 02:41:22,636
that make it a property,
can that be replicated,

3191
02:41:22,636 --> 02:41:23,595
have any other-

3192
02:41:23,594 --> 02:41:26,997
- I think it's possible to
create other crypto properties.

3193
02:41:26,997 --> 02:41:30,497
- Does the having a head like of a project

3194
02:41:32,114 --> 02:41:35,453
a thing that limits its
ability to be a property

3195
02:41:35,453 --> 02:41:38,287
if you try to replicate a project?

3196
02:41:39,227 --> 02:41:41,730
Or is that the fundamental flaw?

3197
02:41:41,729 --> 02:41:44,185
- Look, I think the real fundamental issue

3198
02:41:44,185 --> 02:41:47,185
is you just never want it to change.

3199
02:41:48,195 --> 02:41:51,755
Like if you really want
something decentralized,

3200
02:41:51,755 --> 02:41:55,795
you want a genetic
template that substantially

3201
02:41:55,795 --> 02:41:59,433
is not gonna change for a thousand years.

3202
02:41:59,433 --> 02:42:01,475
So I think Satoshi said it at one point.

3203
02:42:01,476 --> 02:42:02,873
He said the nature of the software

3204
02:42:02,872 --> 02:42:07,872
is such that by version 0.1,
it's genetic code was set.

3205
02:42:08,123 --> 02:42:10,182
If there was any development team

3206
02:42:10,182 --> 02:42:14,395
that's continually changing
it on a routine basis,

3207
02:42:14,395 --> 02:42:16,233
it becomes harder and harder

3208
02:42:16,233 --> 02:42:18,469
to maintain is decentralization

3209
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:20,572
because now there's the issue

3210
02:42:20,573 --> 02:42:23,628
of who's influencing the changes.

3211
02:42:23,628 --> 02:42:26,073
- [Lex] Yeah.
- So what you really want

3212
02:42:26,073 --> 02:42:28,989
is a very, very simple idea, right?

3213
02:42:30,902 --> 02:42:32,519
The simplest idea, I'm
just gonna keep track

3214
02:42:32,519 --> 02:42:35,769
of who owns 21 million parts of energy.

3215
02:42:36,772 --> 02:42:40,939
And when someone proposes
big functional upgrades,

3216
02:42:41,897 --> 02:42:43,562
you don't really want that development

3217
02:42:43,561 --> 02:42:44,804
to go on the base layer.

3218
02:42:44,804 --> 02:42:47,065
You want that development
to go on the layer threes

3219
02:42:47,065 --> 02:42:52,065
because now Cash App has a
proprietary set of functionality

3220
02:42:52,389 --> 02:42:54,056
and it's a security.

3221
02:42:55,024 --> 02:42:59,200
And if you're gonna promote
the use of this thing,

3222
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:03,108
you're not gonna promote
the layer three security

3223
02:43:03,109 --> 02:43:06,456
because that's an edge to a given entity

3224
02:43:06,456 --> 02:43:07,935
and you're trusting the counterparty.

3225
02:43:07,935 --> 02:43:12,685
You're gonna promote the layer
one or most the layer two.

3226
02:43:14,290 --> 02:43:19,191
- Okay, so one of the
fascinating things about Bitcoin,

3227
02:43:19,191 --> 02:43:21,858
and sorry to romanticize certain notions,

3228
02:43:21,858 --> 02:43:26,216
but Satoshi Nakamoto, that
the founder is anonymous.

3229
02:43:26,216 --> 02:43:30,194
Maybe you can speak to
whether that's useful,

3230
02:43:30,194 --> 02:43:32,507
but also I just like
the psychology of that

3231
02:43:32,507 --> 02:43:34,591
to imagine that there's a
human being that was able

3232
02:43:34,591 --> 02:43:37,639
to create something special and walk away.

3233
02:43:37,638 --> 02:43:40,940
So first, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?

3234
02:43:40,941 --> 02:43:42,904
- I'm certain I'm not. (chuckles)

3235
02:43:42,904 --> 02:43:45,118
(Lex chuckles)

3236
02:43:45,118 --> 02:43:49,109
No, actually, I think the
providence is really important

3237
02:43:49,109 --> 02:43:52,128
and if I were to look at
the highlighted points,

3238
02:43:52,128 --> 02:43:55,725
I think having a founder
that was anonymous

3239
02:43:55,725 --> 02:43:57,567
or synonymous is important.

3240
02:43:57,566 --> 02:44:00,604
I think the founder
disappearing is also important.

3241
02:44:00,604 --> 02:44:02,725
I think that the fact
that the Satoshi coins

3242
02:44:02,725 --> 02:44:05,225
never moved is also important.

3243
02:44:06,078 --> 02:44:09,396
I think the lack of an
initial coin offering

3244
02:44:09,397 --> 02:44:10,675
is also important.

3245
02:44:10,674 --> 02:44:14,590
I think the lack of a
corporate sponsor is important.

3246
02:44:14,590 --> 02:44:17,277
I think the fact that
it traded for 15 months

3247
02:44:17,277 --> 02:44:20,943
with no commercial value
was also important.

3248
02:44:22,084 --> 02:44:25,667
I think that the
simplicity of the protocol

3249
02:44:28,359 --> 02:44:29,550
is very important.

3250
02:44:29,550 --> 02:44:32,252
I think that the outcome
of the block size wars

3251
02:44:32,253 --> 02:44:34,203
is very important.

3252
02:44:34,202 --> 02:44:38,369
And all of those things
add up to common property.

3253
02:44:39,950 --> 02:44:43,734
They're all indicia, indicators
of a digital property

3254
02:44:43,734 --> 02:44:45,662
as opposed to security.

3255
02:44:45,662 --> 02:44:47,781
If there was a Satoshi sitting around,

3256
02:44:47,781 --> 02:44:51,698
sitting on top of $50
billion worth of Bitcoin,

3257
02:44:52,703 --> 02:44:56,953
I don't think it would
cripple Bitcoin as property,

3258
02:44:58,315 --> 02:45:02,665
but I think it would undermine
its digital property.

3259
02:45:02,665 --> 02:45:05,906
And if I wanted to undermine
a crypto asset network,

3260
02:45:05,906 --> 02:45:08,611
I would do the opposite
of all those things.

3261
02:45:08,611 --> 02:45:10,168
I would launch one myself.

3262
02:45:10,167 --> 02:45:13,850
I would sell 25% or 50%
to the general public.

3263
02:45:13,850 --> 02:45:15,879
I would keep some of the initial,

3264
02:45:15,879 --> 02:45:18,130
I would pre mine some
stuff or early mine it,

3265
02:45:18,129 --> 02:45:20,851
and I would keep an influence on it.

3266
02:45:20,852 --> 02:45:24,704
Those are all the opposite
of what you would do

3267
02:45:24,703 --> 02:45:27,620
in order to create common property.

3268
02:45:29,041 --> 02:45:31,307
And so I see the entire story as Satoshi

3269
02:45:31,308 --> 02:45:34,708
giving a gift of digital property

3270
02:45:34,708 --> 02:45:37,625
to the human race and disappearing.

3271
02:45:39,202 --> 02:45:40,596
- Do you think it was one person?

3272
02:45:40,596 --> 02:45:43,130
Do you have ideas of who it could be?

3273
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:45,251
- I don't care to speculate. (laughs)

3274
02:45:45,251 --> 02:45:48,120
- [Lex] Okay, but do you
think it was one person?

3275
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:51,151
- I think it was one
person, maybe in conjunction

3276
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:52,373
with a bunch of others.

3277
02:45:52,373 --> 02:45:53,887
I mean, it might have
been a group of people

3278
02:45:53,887 --> 02:45:56,617
that were working together, but
certainly there's a Satoshi.

3279
02:45:56,617 --> 02:45:58,611
- I mean, it's just so fascinating to me

3280
02:45:58,611 --> 02:46:02,713
that one person could be
so brave and thoughtful.

3281
02:46:02,713 --> 02:46:03,986
Or do you think a lot of his accent,

3282
02:46:03,986 --> 02:46:05,679
like the block size wars,

3283
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:09,021
the decision to make a
block a certain size.

3284
02:46:09,021 --> 02:46:10,478
All the things you mentioned led up

3285
02:46:10,477 --> 02:46:15,414
to the characteristics
that make Bitcoin property.

3286
02:46:15,415 --> 02:46:17,473
Do you think that's an accident,

3287
02:46:17,472 --> 02:46:20,168
or was it deeply thought through?

3288
02:46:20,168 --> 02:46:22,466
This is almost like a
history of science question.

3289
02:46:22,466 --> 02:46:23,299
- I think people tried it.

3290
02:46:23,299 --> 02:46:24,933
They tried 40 of them, right?

3291
02:46:24,933 --> 02:46:26,344
I mean, I think there's a history

3292
02:46:26,343 --> 02:46:28,763
of attempting to create
something like this.

3293
02:46:28,763 --> 02:46:30,234
And it was tried many, many times

3294
02:46:30,235 --> 02:46:32,954
and they failed for different reasons.

3295
02:46:32,954 --> 02:46:35,040
And I think that it's like Prometheus

3296
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,197
tried to start a fire 47 times

3297
02:46:37,197 --> 02:46:39,917
and maybe the 48th time it sparked.

3298
02:46:39,917 --> 02:46:44,386
And that's how I see this is
the first one that sparked

3299
02:46:44,386 --> 02:46:46,806
and it sets a roadmap for us.

3300
02:46:46,806 --> 02:46:51,145
And I think if you're
looking for any one word

3301
02:46:51,145 --> 02:46:52,843
that characterize, it's fair, right?

3302
02:46:52,843 --> 02:46:54,338
The whole point of the network

3303
02:46:54,337 --> 02:46:57,921
is it's a fair launch,
a fair distribution.

3304
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:02,462
Like yeah, I have
Bitcoin, but I bought it.

3305
02:47:04,402 --> 02:47:08,068
In fact, at this point
we've paid $4 billion

3306
02:47:09,236 --> 02:47:11,465
of real cash to buy it.

3307
02:47:11,465 --> 02:47:16,465
If I was sitting on the same
position and I had it for free,

3308
02:47:17,022 --> 02:47:19,530
then there's always this
question of did I pay,

3309
02:47:19,530 --> 02:47:22,577
or I bought it for a nickel,
a coin, or a penny of coin.

3310
02:47:22,576 --> 02:47:24,557
The question is, was it fair?

3311
02:47:24,558 --> 02:47:28,143
And that's a very hard
question to answer, right?

3312
02:47:28,143 --> 02:47:32,837
Did you acquire the Bitcoin
that you own fairly?

3313
02:47:32,837 --> 02:47:34,780
And if you rolled the clock back,

3314
02:47:34,781 --> 02:47:37,635
you could have bought it
for a nickel or a dime,

3315
02:47:37,635 --> 02:47:39,119
but that was when it was a million times

3316
02:47:39,119 --> 02:47:41,474
more likely to fail, right?

3317
02:47:41,474 --> 02:47:44,718
When the risk was greater,
the cost was lower,

3318
02:47:44,718 --> 02:47:48,191
and then over time the risk became lower

3319
02:47:48,191 --> 02:47:50,809
and the cost became greater.

3320
02:47:50,808 --> 02:47:55,167
And the real critical thing
was to allow the marketplace

3321
02:47:55,167 --> 02:47:59,572
absent any powerful,
interested actor, right?

3322
02:47:59,572 --> 02:48:01,861
It's almost like if Satoshi
held a million coins

3323
02:48:01,861 --> 02:48:03,989
and then stayed engaged for 10 more years,

3324
02:48:03,988 --> 02:48:06,452
tweaking things in the background,

3325
02:48:06,452 --> 02:48:09,185
there'd still be that question.

3326
02:48:09,185 --> 02:48:11,635
But what we've got is
really a beautiful thing.

3327
02:48:11,635 --> 02:48:14,728
We've got a chain reaction in cyberspace

3328
02:48:14,727 --> 02:48:18,477
or an ideology spreading
virally in the world

3329
02:48:21,113 --> 02:48:24,863
that has seasoned in a
fair, ethical fashion.

3330
02:48:27,415 --> 02:48:29,856
Sometimes it's a very
violent, brutal fashion

3331
02:48:29,855 --> 02:48:32,472
with all the volatility, right?

3332
02:48:32,472 --> 02:48:36,702
And there's been a lot of
sound and fury along the way.

3333
02:48:36,702 --> 02:48:38,450
- How do you psychoanalyze,

3334
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:42,342
how do you deal from a financial,
from a human perspective

3335
02:48:42,343 --> 02:48:43,800
with the volatility?

3336
02:48:43,799 --> 02:48:46,278
You mentioned you could
have gotten it for a nickel,

3337
02:48:46,279 --> 02:48:47,841
and the risk was great.

3338
02:48:47,841 --> 02:48:49,293
Where's the risk today?

3339
02:48:49,293 --> 02:48:50,912
What's your sense?

3340
02:48:50,912 --> 02:48:54,569
- We're 13 years into
this entire activity.

3341
02:48:54,569 --> 02:48:57,352
I think the risk has never been lower.

3342
02:48:57,352 --> 02:48:59,745
If you look at all the risks, right?

3343
02:48:59,745 --> 02:49:03,268
The risks in the early years are,

3344
02:49:03,268 --> 02:49:05,543
is the engineering protocol proper?

3345
02:49:05,543 --> 02:49:08,153
Like one megabyte block size,

3346
02:49:08,153 --> 02:49:12,878
10 minute clock frequency
cryptography is first,

3347
02:49:12,878 --> 02:49:16,961
will it be hacked or will
it crash 730,000 blocks

3348
02:49:17,939 --> 02:49:19,435
and it hasn't crashed?

3349
02:49:19,435 --> 02:49:20,269
Will it be hacked?

3350
02:49:20,269 --> 02:49:21,443
Hasn't been hacked.

3351
02:49:21,442 --> 02:49:22,760
But it's a lengthy thing, right?

3352
02:49:22,761 --> 02:49:25,220
You wait 13 years to
see if it'll be hacked.

3353
02:49:25,220 --> 02:49:28,263
But on the other hand,
with a billion dollars,

3354
02:49:28,263 --> 02:49:29,584
it's not as interesting a target

3355
02:49:29,584 --> 02:49:31,473
as it is with a hundred billion.

3356
02:49:31,474 --> 02:49:34,127
And when it gets to be worth a trillion,

3357
02:49:34,127 --> 02:49:36,997
then it's a bigger target.

3358
02:49:36,996 --> 02:49:40,786
So, the risk has been
bleeding off over time

3359
02:49:40,786 --> 02:49:42,869
as the network monetized.

3360
02:49:43,769 --> 02:49:47,081
I think the second question
is, will it be banned?

3361
02:49:47,081 --> 02:49:47,914
You couldn't know.

3362
02:49:47,914 --> 02:49:51,863
It literally could have been
banned at many times early on.

3363
02:49:51,862 --> 02:49:53,825
In fact, in 2013 I tweeted on the subject,

3364
02:49:53,825 --> 02:49:55,507
I thought it would be banned.

3365
02:49:55,507 --> 02:49:58,521
I made a very infamous tweet.
- Infamous tweet, yeah.

3366
02:49:58,522 --> 02:50:00,699
- I thought it was gonna be banned.

3367
02:50:00,699 --> 02:50:04,871
In 2014, the IRS designated it as property

3368
02:50:04,870 --> 02:50:06,986
and gave it property tax treatment, okay?

3369
02:50:06,986 --> 02:50:10,022
So they could have
given it a tax treatment

3370
02:50:10,022 --> 02:50:11,584
where you had to pay tax

3371
02:50:11,584 --> 02:50:15,238
on the unrealized
capital gains every year,

3372
02:50:15,238 --> 02:50:19,460
and it probably would've
crushed it to death, right?

3373
02:50:19,460 --> 02:50:22,521
So it could have been in any number

3374
02:50:22,522 --> 02:50:25,147
of places banned by a government,

3375
02:50:25,147 --> 02:50:28,806
but in fact it was
legitimized as property.

3376
02:50:28,806 --> 02:50:29,951
And then the question is,

3377
02:50:29,950 --> 02:50:31,343
would it be hacked or would it be copied?

3378
02:50:31,343 --> 02:50:32,347
Will it be something better than that?

3379
02:50:32,347 --> 02:50:35,354
And it was copied 15,000 times.

3380
02:50:35,354 --> 02:50:39,623
And the story of all those
and they either diverged

3381
02:50:39,623 --> 02:50:42,707
to be something totally
different and not comparable,

3382
02:50:42,707 --> 02:50:45,144
or someone trying to copy

3383
02:50:45,144 --> 02:50:48,416
a non sovereign bearer
instrument store of value

3384
02:50:48,415 --> 02:50:50,509
found that their networks crashed

3385
02:50:50,509 --> 02:50:52,549
to be 1% of what Bitcoin is.

3386
02:50:52,549 --> 02:50:55,132
So now we're sitting at a point

3387
02:50:56,182 --> 02:50:59,639
where all those risks are out of the way.

3388
02:50:59,638 --> 02:51:03,421
I would say that year one of
institutional adoption is,

3389
02:51:03,422 --> 02:51:07,622
it started August, 2020, that's
when MicroStrategy bought

3390
02:51:07,621 --> 02:51:09,965
$250 million worth of Bitcoin.

3391
02:51:09,966 --> 02:51:11,385
And we put that out on the wire.

3392
02:51:11,385 --> 02:51:13,255
We were the first publicly traded company

3393
02:51:13,255 --> 02:51:15,255
to actually buy Bitcoin.

3394
02:51:16,172 --> 02:51:18,195
I don't think you could have
found a $5 million purchase

3395
02:51:18,195 --> 02:51:20,949
from a public company before we did that.

3396
02:51:20,949 --> 02:51:24,322
So that was kinda like a gun going off.

3397
02:51:24,322 --> 02:51:28,082
And then in the next 12
months, Tesla bought Bitcoin,

3398
02:51:28,082 --> 02:51:31,683
Square bought Bitcoin, and
I'd say now we're in year two

3399
02:51:31,683 --> 02:51:35,355
of institutional adoption, and about 24,

3400
02:51:35,354 --> 02:51:37,948
should be 24 publicly
traded Bitcoin miners

3401
02:51:37,948 --> 02:51:40,213
by the end of this quarter.

3402
02:51:40,213 --> 02:51:44,289
So you're looking at 36
publicly traded companies,

3403
02:51:44,289 --> 02:51:48,872
and you've got 50, at least
in the range of $50 billion

3404
02:51:51,460 --> 02:51:55,367
of Bitcoin on the balance sheet
of publicly traded companies

3405
02:51:55,367 --> 02:51:57,722
and hundreds of billions of dollars

3406
02:51:57,722 --> 02:52:01,306
of market cap of Bitcoin
exposed companies.

3407
02:52:02,146 --> 02:52:04,313
So, I would say the asset,

3408
02:52:05,274 --> 02:52:08,941
decade one was
entrepreneurial experimental,

3409
02:52:11,233 --> 02:52:15,746
decade two is a rotation from
entrepreneurs to institutions

3410
02:52:15,745 --> 02:52:17,609
and is becoming institutionalized.

3411
02:52:17,610 --> 02:52:19,824
So maybe decade one, you
go from zero to a trillion,

3412
02:52:19,824 --> 02:52:21,521
and a decade two, you go from 1 trillion

3413
02:52:21,521 --> 02:52:23,145
to a hundred trillion.

3414
02:52:23,145 --> 02:52:25,578
- What about governments,
government adoption?

3415
02:52:25,577 --> 02:52:27,708
You said institutional adoption.

3416
02:52:27,709 --> 02:52:29,743
Are governments important in this?

3417
02:52:29,743 --> 02:52:33,388
Maybe making it some
governments incorporating it

3418
02:52:33,388 --> 02:52:38,388
into as a currency into their
banks, all that kind of stuff.

3419
02:52:38,430 --> 02:52:39,693
Is that important?

3420
02:52:39,693 --> 02:52:43,177
And if it is, when will it happen?

3421
02:52:43,177 --> 02:52:46,360
- It's not essential for the
success of the asset class,

3422
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:51,360
but I think it's inevitable
in various degrees over time.

3423
02:52:51,369 --> 02:52:53,757
But the most likely thing to happen next

3424
02:52:53,757 --> 02:52:57,757
is large acquisitions by
institutional investors

3425
02:53:01,297 --> 02:53:04,083
of Bitcoin as a digital gold

3426
02:53:04,083 --> 02:53:07,350
where they're just swapping
out gold for digital gold

3427
02:53:07,350 --> 02:53:09,140
and thinking of it like that.

3428
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:11,074
And the government entities
most likely to be involved

3429
02:53:11,075 --> 02:53:13,582
with that would be sovereign wealth funds.

3430
02:53:13,582 --> 02:53:15,179
If you look at all the
sovereign wealth funds

3431
02:53:15,179 --> 02:53:18,699
that are holding big tech stock, equities,

3432
02:53:18,699 --> 02:53:21,867
the Swiss, the Norwegians,
the Middle Easterners,

3433
02:53:21,867 --> 02:53:25,454
if you can hold big tech
then holding digital gold

3434
02:53:25,454 --> 02:53:28,371
would be not far removed from that.

3435
02:53:29,591 --> 02:53:32,591
That's a non-controversial adoption.

3436
02:53:34,101 --> 02:53:36,842
I think there are
opportunities for governments

3437
02:53:36,842 --> 02:53:39,666
that are much more profound, right?

3438
02:53:39,665 --> 02:53:43,653
If a government started to adopt Bitcoin

3439
02:53:43,654 --> 02:53:45,987
as a treasury reserve asset,

3440
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:50,269
that's much bigger than
just an asset investment

3441
02:53:50,269 --> 02:53:51,852
that's 100X bigger.

3442
02:53:53,674 --> 02:53:55,211
And you could imagine

3443
02:53:55,211 --> 02:53:57,769
that's like a trillion dollar opportunity.

3444
02:53:57,769 --> 02:53:59,725
Like any government
that wanted to adopt it

3445
02:53:59,725 --> 02:54:01,299
as a treasury reserve asset

3446
02:54:01,299 --> 02:54:04,496
would probably generate
trillions of dollars,

3447
02:54:04,495 --> 02:54:06,789
a trillion or more of value.

3448
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:10,325
And then the thing that
people think about is,

3449
02:54:10,325 --> 02:54:13,134
well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin

3450
02:54:13,134 --> 02:54:15,634
or any other export commodity?

3451
02:54:16,818 --> 02:54:18,218
I think there's like $1.8 trillion

3452
02:54:18,218 --> 02:54:22,356
or more of export
commodities in the world.

3453
02:54:22,356 --> 02:54:24,266
And right now they're
all priced in dollars.

3454
02:54:24,266 --> 02:54:26,501
I think that this is a colorful thing,

3455
02:54:26,501 --> 02:54:28,567
but it not really that relevant.

3456
02:54:28,566 --> 02:54:31,072
Like you could sell all
that stuff in dollars.

3457
02:54:31,073 --> 02:54:34,088
The relevant decision that
any institution makes,

3458
02:54:34,088 --> 02:54:37,120
whether they're a non-profit university,

3459
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:38,801
a corporation or a government,

3460
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:41,236
is what's your treasury reserve asset?

3461
02:54:41,236 --> 02:54:44,739
And if your treasury
reserve asset is the peso,

3462
02:54:44,739 --> 02:54:49,739
and if the peso is losing 20%
or 30% of its value a year,

3463
02:54:50,941 --> 02:54:55,608
then your balance sheet is
collapsing within five years.

3464
02:54:57,688 --> 02:55:01,354
And if the treasury
reserve asset is dollars

3465
02:55:02,199 --> 02:55:05,301
in currency derivatives and US treasuries,

3466
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:07,816
then you're getting your seven.

3467
02:55:07,816 --> 02:55:12,816
Right now it's probably 15%
or more monetary inflation.

3468
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:16,213
We're running double the historic average.

3469
02:55:16,213 --> 02:55:17,047
You could argue triple.

3470
02:55:17,047 --> 02:55:18,314
Somewhere between double and triple

3471
02:55:18,314 --> 02:55:21,790
depending upon what your metric is.

3472
02:55:21,790 --> 02:55:23,367
So, do I think it'll happen?

3473
02:55:23,367 --> 02:55:25,006
I think that they're conservative,

3474
02:55:25,006 --> 02:55:26,020
but they have to be shocked.

3475
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:28,808
And I think there is a shock.

3476
02:55:28,808 --> 02:55:32,786
The late Russian sanctions are a big shock

3477
02:55:32,786 --> 02:55:36,297
that when the West sees $300
billion worth of Russian gold

3478
02:55:36,297 --> 02:55:39,332
and currency derivatives,
I think it, you know,

3479
02:55:39,332 --> 02:55:40,894
you got the famous quote by Putin

3480
02:55:40,894 --> 02:55:44,810
that we have to rethink
our treasury strategies

3481
02:55:45,700 --> 02:55:49,088
and that pushes everybody
toward a commodity strategy.

3482
02:55:49,088 --> 02:55:52,040
What commodities do I wanna hold?

3483
02:55:52,040 --> 02:55:53,516
I think that's got a
lot of people thinking.

3484
02:55:53,516 --> 02:55:55,664
I think it's got the Chinese thinking.

3485
02:55:55,665 --> 02:55:57,933
Everybody wants to be the
reserve currency, right?

3486
02:55:57,933 --> 02:56:02,074
So if I buy $50 billion
worth of dollars every year,

3487
02:56:02,074 --> 02:56:05,074
then I buy 500 billion over a decade

3488
02:56:07,847 --> 02:56:12,014
and I probably pay $250
billion of inflation costs

3489
02:56:15,658 --> 02:56:18,992
on the backs of my citizens in a decade.

3490
02:56:20,380 --> 02:56:24,016
- So inflation could be one
of the sources of shock.

3491
02:56:24,016 --> 02:56:27,682
And you wonder if there
is a switch to Bitcoin,

3492
02:56:27,683 --> 02:56:30,170
whether it would be a bang or a whimper.

3493
02:56:30,170 --> 02:56:32,823
Like what is the nature of
the shock or the transition?

3494
02:56:32,823 --> 02:56:36,823
- I think that the year
2022 is pretty catalytic

3495
02:56:37,855 --> 02:56:42,602
for digital assets in general
and for Bitcoin in particular.

3496
02:56:42,602 --> 02:56:44,985
The Canadian trucker crisis,

3497
02:56:44,986 --> 02:56:47,682
I think educated hundreds
of millions of people

3498
02:56:47,682 --> 02:56:51,040
and made them start questioning

3499
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:53,638
their property rights and their banks.

3500
02:56:53,638 --> 02:56:56,888
I think the Ukraine was a second shock,

3501
02:56:59,898 --> 02:57:04,898
but I think that the Russian
sanctions was a third shock.

3502
02:57:05,073 --> 02:57:06,858
- [Lex] Yeah.
- I think all three of the,

3503
02:57:06,858 --> 02:57:10,108
and I think hyperinflation
in the rest of the world

3504
02:57:10,108 --> 02:57:12,647
is a fourth shock and
then persistent inflation

3505
02:57:12,647 --> 02:57:15,035
in the US is a fifth shock.

3506
02:57:15,034 --> 02:57:18,076
So, I think it's a perfect storm.

3507
02:57:18,076 --> 02:57:21,100
And if you put all these events together,

3508
02:57:21,101 --> 02:57:21,934
what do they signify?

3509
02:57:21,933 --> 02:57:24,484
They signify the rational conclusion

3510
02:57:24,485 --> 02:57:27,772
for any person thinking about this is,

3511
02:57:27,772 --> 02:57:31,105
I'm not sure if I can trust my property,

3512
02:57:31,948 --> 02:57:33,773
I don't know if I have property rights,

3513
02:57:33,772 --> 02:57:35,856
I don't know if I can trust the bank.

3514
02:57:35,856 --> 02:57:40,317
And if I'm politically
at odds with the leader

3515
02:57:40,317 --> 02:57:43,610
of my own country, I'm
gonna lose my property.

3516
02:57:43,611 --> 02:57:46,212
And if I'm politically
at odds with the owner

3517
02:57:46,211 --> 02:57:51,208
of another country, I'm
still gonna lose my property.

3518
02:57:51,209 --> 02:57:53,382
And when push comes to shove,

3519
02:57:53,381 --> 02:57:56,819
the banks will freeze my
assets and seize them.

3520
02:57:56,819 --> 02:57:59,270
And I think that is playing out

3521
02:57:59,271 --> 02:58:02,104
in front of everybody in the world

3522
02:58:03,331 --> 02:58:06,747
such that your logical response would be,

3523
02:58:10,040 --> 02:58:15,040
I'm going to convert my weak
currency to a strong currency.

3524
02:58:15,341 --> 02:58:18,774
Like I'll convert my peso
and lira to the dollar.

3525
02:58:18,774 --> 02:58:23,240
I'm going to convert my weak
property to strong property.

3526
02:58:23,240 --> 02:58:27,525
I'm gonna sell my
building downtown Moscow,

3527
02:58:27,525 --> 02:58:31,405
and I'd rather own a
building in New York City.

3528
02:58:31,405 --> 02:58:34,215
I'd rather own in a powerful nation

3529
02:58:34,215 --> 02:58:37,273
than be stuck with a building in Nigeria

3530
02:58:37,273 --> 02:58:40,122
or a building in Argentina or whatever.

3531
02:58:40,122 --> 02:58:42,145
So, I'm gonna sell my weak properties,

3532
02:58:42,146 --> 02:58:44,998
buy strong properties, I'm
gonna convert my physical assets

3533
02:58:44,997 --> 02:58:46,497
to digital assets.

3534
02:58:47,494 --> 02:58:49,184
I'd rather own a digital building

3535
02:58:49,183 --> 02:58:51,978
than own a physical building.

3536
02:58:51,978 --> 02:58:54,960
Because if I had a billion
dollar building in Moscow,

3537
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:56,592
who can I rent that to?

3538
02:58:56,593 --> 02:58:58,930
But if I have a billion
dollar digital building,

3539
02:58:58,930 --> 02:59:02,233
I can rent it to anybody
in any city in the world,

3540
02:59:02,233 --> 02:59:04,780
anybody with money and
the maintenance cost

3541
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:06,509
is almost nothing.

3542
02:59:06,509 --> 02:59:08,297
And I can hold it for
a hundred years, okay?

3543
02:59:08,297 --> 02:59:10,195
So it's an indestructible building.

3544
02:59:10,195 --> 02:59:14,498
And then finally, I wanna
move from having my assets

3545
02:59:14,498 --> 02:59:19,323
in a bank with a counterparty
to self custody assets, right?

3546
02:59:19,323 --> 02:59:21,836
And this is not, it's not just Ukraine,

3547
02:59:21,835 --> 02:59:24,664
but this is like the
story in Turkey, Lebanon,

3548
02:59:24,665 --> 02:59:27,998
Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America,

3549
02:59:29,198 --> 02:59:30,529
you don't really wanna be sitting

3550
02:59:30,529 --> 02:59:34,447
with $10 million in a bank in Istanbul.

3551
02:59:34,447 --> 02:59:37,802
The bank's gonna freeze your
money, convert it to lira,

3552
02:59:37,802 --> 02:59:40,396
devalue the lira, and then feed it

3553
02:59:40,397 --> 02:59:42,912
back to you over 17 years, right?

3554
02:59:42,912 --> 02:59:46,895
- So self custody assets
would be layer one Bitcoin?

3555
02:59:46,895 --> 02:59:49,935
- Self custody assets, it's like if I got

3556
02:59:49,935 --> 02:59:52,277
my own hardware wallet

3557
02:59:52,277 --> 02:59:56,693
and I've either got your
highest form of self custody

3558
02:59:57,653 --> 03:00:00,572
would be Bitcoin on
your own hardware wallet

3559
03:00:00,572 --> 03:00:02,701
or Bitcoin on your own self custody.

3560
03:00:02,701 --> 03:00:04,661
And the other thing people think about

3561
03:00:04,662 --> 03:00:06,795
is how do I get crypto dollars

3562
03:00:06,795 --> 03:00:09,969
like Tether, like some stable coin?

3563
03:00:09,968 --> 03:00:10,801
- [Lex] Yeah.

3564
03:00:10,801 --> 03:00:12,422
- Like I'd rather, if you had a choice,

3565
03:00:12,422 --> 03:00:14,417
would you rather have your money in a bank

3566
03:00:14,416 --> 03:00:16,440
in a war zone in dollars,

3567
03:00:16,441 --> 03:00:19,477
or have your money in a stable coin

3568
03:00:19,477 --> 03:00:22,727
on your mobile phone in dollars, right?

3569
03:00:23,824 --> 03:00:25,666
I mean, you would take the latter risk

3570
03:00:25,665 --> 03:00:27,231
rather than the former risk.

3571
03:00:27,231 --> 03:00:29,009
- In a war zone, definitely yeah.

3572
03:00:29,009 --> 03:00:30,476
- [Michael] And you
can see that happening,

3573
03:00:30,476 --> 03:00:31,440
like we've gone from 5 billion

3574
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:33,852
in stable coins to 200 billion.

3575
03:00:33,852 --> 03:00:34,693
- Yeah.

3576
03:00:34,692 --> 03:00:36,390
- [Michael] In the last 24 months.

3577
03:00:36,390 --> 03:00:37,224
- Yeah.

3578
03:00:37,224 --> 03:00:38,711
- So, I do think there's massive demand

3579
03:00:38,711 --> 03:00:43,045
for crypto dollars in the
form of a US dollar asset.

3580
03:00:45,691 --> 03:00:50,007
And everybody in the world
would say, "Yeah, I want that."

3581
03:00:50,007 --> 03:00:53,209
Well, unless you're
just an extreme patriot,

3582
03:00:53,209 --> 03:00:55,185
but most people in the world
would say, "I want that."

3583
03:00:55,185 --> 03:00:57,235
And then a lesser group
of people would say,

3584
03:00:57,235 --> 03:00:59,605
"I think I want to be
able to carry my property

3585
03:00:59,604 --> 03:01:04,604
in the palm of my hand, so
I have self custody of it."

3586
03:01:04,753 --> 03:01:08,940
- So Bitcoin price has gone
through quite a rollercoaster.

3587
03:01:08,940 --> 03:01:12,717
What do you think is the
high point is gonna hit?

3588
03:01:12,717 --> 03:01:14,427
- I think it'll go forever, right?

3589
03:01:14,427 --> 03:01:18,262
I mean, I think the Bitcoin is going to,

3590
03:01:18,263 --> 03:01:20,749
it's going to climb in
a serpentine fashion.

3591
03:01:20,748 --> 03:01:23,304
It's going to advance and come back

3592
03:01:23,304 --> 03:01:25,720
and it's gonna keep climbing.

3593
03:01:27,296 --> 03:01:29,299
I think that the volatility attracts

3594
03:01:29,299 --> 03:01:32,451
all the capital into the marketplace.

3595
03:01:32,450 --> 03:01:35,495
And so the volatility makes
it the most interesting thing

3596
03:01:35,495 --> 03:01:36,799
in the financial universe.

3597
03:01:36,799 --> 03:01:38,899
It also generates massive yield

3598
03:01:38,899 --> 03:01:43,899
and massive returns for traders,
and that attracts capital.

3599
03:01:44,334 --> 03:01:45,603
Like we're talking about the difference

3600
03:01:45,603 --> 03:01:49,488
between 5% return and 500% return.

3601
03:01:49,488 --> 03:01:53,572
So the fast money is
attracted by the volatility.

3602
03:01:55,533 --> 03:01:59,014
The volatility's been
decreasing year by year by year.

3603
03:01:59,014 --> 03:02:01,514
I think that it's stabilizing.

3604
03:02:02,934 --> 03:02:04,543
I don't think we'll see as much volatility

3605
03:02:04,543 --> 03:02:07,260
in the future as we have in the past.

3606
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:10,093
I think that if we look at Bitcoin

3607
03:02:10,985 --> 03:02:14,235
and model it as digital gold, you know,

3608
03:02:15,112 --> 03:02:19,279
the market cap goes to
between 10 and 20 trillion.

3609
03:02:20,245 --> 03:02:25,245
Remember gold is defective
property, gold is dead money.

3610
03:02:25,254 --> 03:02:26,556
You have a billion dollars of gold

3611
03:02:26,557 --> 03:02:28,224
that sits in a vault for a decade.

3612
03:02:28,224 --> 03:02:30,110
It's very hard to mortgage the gold.

3613
03:02:30,110 --> 03:02:32,434
It's also very hard to rent the gold.

3614
03:02:32,433 --> 03:02:33,579
You can't loan the gold.

3615
03:02:33,579 --> 03:02:36,947
No one's going to create
a business with your gold.

3616
03:02:36,947 --> 03:02:39,728
So gold doesn't generate much of a yield.

3617
03:02:39,728 --> 03:02:41,674
So for that reason, most
people wouldn't store

3618
03:02:41,674 --> 03:02:44,227
a billion dollars for a decade in gold.

3619
03:02:44,227 --> 03:02:45,060
They would buy a billion dollars

3620
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:47,768
of commercial real estate, property.

3621
03:02:47,768 --> 03:02:50,115
And the reason why is
because I can rent it

3622
03:02:50,115 --> 03:02:52,281
and generate a yield on it

3623
03:02:52,281 --> 03:02:54,368
that's in excess of the maintenance cost.

3624
03:02:54,369 --> 03:02:57,113
So if you consider digital property,

3625
03:02:57,112 --> 03:03:01,529
that's a hundred to $200
trillion addressable market.

3626
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:05,967
So I would think it goes from 10 trillion

3627
03:03:05,967 --> 03:03:06,967
to a hundred trillion as people

3628
03:03:06,967 --> 03:03:08,953
start to think of it as digital property.

3629
03:03:08,952 --> 03:03:12,413
- What does that mean in
terms of price per coin?

3630
03:03:12,414 --> 03:03:14,081
- At 500,000, right?

3631
03:03:15,181 --> 03:03:17,477
That's a $10 trillion asset-
- [Lex] Essentially.

3632
03:03:17,477 --> 03:03:21,552
- At 5 million, that's a
hundred trillion dollars asset.

3633
03:03:21,551 --> 03:03:24,743
- So you think it crosses a
million, it can go even higher.

3634
03:03:24,744 --> 03:03:26,734
- Yeah, I think it keeps going up forever.

3635
03:03:26,734 --> 03:03:27,567
I mean, there's no reason

3636
03:03:27,566 --> 03:03:29,315
we can't go to 10 million a coin, right?

3637
03:03:29,316 --> 03:03:32,863
Because digital property
isn't the highest form, right?

3638
03:03:32,862 --> 03:03:35,826
Gold was that low frequency money.

3639
03:03:35,826 --> 03:03:38,358
Property is mid frequency money.

3640
03:03:38,359 --> 03:03:41,525
But when I start to program it faster,

3641
03:03:43,313 --> 03:03:46,396
it starts to look like digital energy

3642
03:03:47,659 --> 03:03:50,868
and then it doesn't just replace property,

3643
03:03:50,868 --> 03:03:54,166
then you're starting to replace bonds.

3644
03:03:54,165 --> 03:03:55,733
It's a hundred trillion in bonds.

3645
03:03:55,734 --> 03:03:57,649
There's 50 to hundred trillion

3646
03:03:57,648 --> 03:04:00,522
in other currency derivatives.

3647
03:04:00,522 --> 03:04:03,717
And then and these are all
conventional use cases, right?

3648
03:04:03,718 --> 03:04:06,468
I think that there's 350 trillion

3649
03:04:09,055 --> 03:04:12,459
to $500 trillion worth of currency,

3650
03:04:12,459 --> 03:04:15,266
currency derivatives in the world.

3651
03:04:15,265 --> 03:04:16,689
And when I say that, I mean things

3652
03:04:16,689 --> 03:04:20,416
that are valued based
upon fiat cash flows.

3653
03:04:20,416 --> 03:04:23,965
Any commercial real estate,
any bond, any sovereign debt,

3654
03:04:23,965 --> 03:04:28,638
any currency itself, any
derivatives to those things,

3655
03:04:28,638 --> 03:04:32,592
they're all derivatives
and they're all defective.

3656
03:04:32,592 --> 03:04:33,745
And they're all defective

3657
03:04:33,745 --> 03:04:37,912
because of this persistent
seven to 14% lapse

3658
03:04:39,092 --> 03:04:42,246
which we call inflation
or monetary expansion.

3659
03:04:42,245 --> 03:04:43,240
Can we switch?

3660
03:04:43,240 --> 03:04:45,966
So I'm just gonna talk
about the energy side of it.

3661
03:04:45,966 --> 03:04:46,799
- Sure.

3662
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:48,313
- [Michael] Like the innovative piece.

3663
03:04:48,313 --> 03:04:49,146
- Yeah.

3664
03:04:49,146 --> 03:04:52,702
- Let's just start with this
idea that I've got a hotel

3665
03:04:52,701 --> 03:04:55,411
worth a billion dollars
with a thousand rooms.

3666
03:04:55,412 --> 03:04:58,503
When it becomes a dematerialized hotel.

3667
03:04:58,503 --> 03:05:00,083
- I love that word so much, by the way,

3668
03:05:00,083 --> 03:05:01,577
dematerialized hotel.

3669
03:05:01,576 --> 03:05:02,745
- Wait, we're across from
the fountain blow here.

3670
03:05:02,745 --> 03:05:04,829
Imagine the fountain
blow is dematerialized.

3671
03:05:04,829 --> 03:05:05,738
- [Lex] Yeah.

3672
03:05:05,738 --> 03:05:07,182
- The problem with the physical hotel

3673
03:05:07,183 --> 03:05:08,858
is it gotta hire real people

3674
03:05:08,858 --> 03:05:10,974
moving subject to the speed of sound

3675
03:05:10,974 --> 03:05:13,760
and physics laws and Newton's laws.

3676
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:16,934
And I can rent it to
people in Miami Beach.

3677
03:05:16,933 --> 03:05:19,938
But if it was a digital
hotel, I could rent the room

3678
03:05:19,939 --> 03:05:23,884
to people in Paris, London,
and New York every night,

3679
03:05:23,884 --> 03:05:26,128
and I can run it with robots.

3680
03:05:26,128 --> 03:05:28,668
And as soon as I do that, I
can rent it by the room hour

3681
03:05:28,667 --> 03:05:30,841
and I can rent it by the room minute.

3682
03:05:30,841 --> 03:05:33,655
And so I start to chop my hotel

3683
03:05:33,655 --> 03:05:37,927
up into a hundred thousand
room hours that I sell

3684
03:05:37,926 --> 03:05:41,422
to the highest bidder
anywhere in the world.

3685
03:05:41,422 --> 03:05:44,527
And you can see, all
of a sudden the yield,

3686
03:05:44,527 --> 03:05:47,734
the rent and the income of the property

3687
03:05:47,734 --> 03:05:49,900
is dramatically increased.

3688
03:05:51,282 --> 03:05:55,057
I can also see the maintenance
cost of the property falls.

3689
03:05:55,058 --> 03:05:58,644
I get on Moore's law and
I'm operating in cyberspace.

3690
03:05:58,644 --> 03:06:02,033
So I got rid of Newton's laws,
I got rid of all the friction

3691
03:06:02,033 --> 03:06:04,350
and all those problems.
- [Lex] Yeah.

3692
03:06:04,351 --> 03:06:08,324
- I tapped into the
benefits of cyberspace.

3693
03:06:08,324 --> 03:06:11,016
I created a global property.

3694
03:06:11,016 --> 03:06:14,393
I started monetizing at
different frequencies.

3695
03:06:14,393 --> 03:06:15,921
And of course now I can mortgage it

3696
03:06:15,921 --> 03:06:18,765
to anybody in the world, right?

3697
03:06:18,765 --> 03:06:20,949
I mean, you're not gonna
be able to get a mortgage

3698
03:06:20,949 --> 03:06:24,640
on a Turkish building from
someone in South Africa.

3699
03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:26,418
You have to find someone that's local

3700
03:06:26,418 --> 03:06:28,502
to the culture you're in.

3701
03:06:29,754 --> 03:06:33,685
So when you start to
move from analog property

3702
03:06:33,684 --> 03:06:36,814
to digital property, it's
not just a little bit better,

3703
03:06:36,815 --> 03:06:38,206
it's a lot better.

3704
03:06:38,206 --> 03:06:40,045
And what I just described, Lex,

3705
03:06:40,045 --> 03:06:42,420
is like the DeFi vision, right?

3706
03:06:42,420 --> 03:06:45,952
It's the beauty of DeFi flash loans,

3707
03:06:45,952 --> 03:06:48,959
money moving at high velocity.

3708
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:52,709
At some point if the
hotel is dematerialized,

3709
03:06:55,698 --> 03:06:59,934
then what's the difference
between renting a hotel room

3710
03:06:59,933 --> 03:07:02,770
and loaning a block of stock, right?

3711
03:07:02,771 --> 03:07:05,628
I'm just finding the highest
best use of the thing.

3712
03:07:05,628 --> 03:07:08,210
- It feels like the magic
really emerges though,

3713
03:07:08,209 --> 03:07:11,794
when you build a lot a market of layer two

3714
03:07:11,795 --> 03:07:14,442
and layer three
technologies on top of that.

3715
03:07:14,442 --> 03:07:18,644
So like, maybe you can
correct me if I'm wrong,

3716
03:07:18,645 --> 03:07:21,620
but for all these hotels and
all these kinds of ideas,

3717
03:07:21,620 --> 03:07:24,317
it's always touching humans at some point

3718
03:07:24,316 --> 03:07:28,983
and the consumers or humans,
business holders and so on,

3719
03:07:31,014 --> 03:07:32,619
so you have to create interface,

3720
03:07:32,620 --> 03:07:34,606
you have to create services

3721
03:07:34,606 --> 03:07:38,281
that make all of that super
efficient, super fun to use,

3722
03:07:38,281 --> 03:07:41,367
pleasant, effective, all
those kinds of things.

3723
03:07:41,367 --> 03:07:43,774
And so you have to build a
whole economy on top of that.

3724
03:07:43,774 --> 03:07:46,215
- Yeah, and I happen to
think that won't be done

3725
03:07:46,215 --> 03:07:47,567
by the crypto industry at all.

3726
03:07:47,567 --> 03:07:51,605
I think that'll be done by
centralized applications.

3727
03:07:51,605 --> 03:07:54,452
I think it'll be the
Citadels of the world,

3728
03:07:54,452 --> 03:07:58,007
the high speed traders of
the world, the New Yorkers,

3729
03:07:58,007 --> 03:08:01,507
I think it'll be Binance, FTX and Coinbase

3730
03:08:02,475 --> 03:08:06,010
as a layer three exchange
that will give you the yield

3731
03:08:06,010 --> 03:08:09,701
and will give you the
loan and the best terms

3732
03:08:09,700 --> 03:08:14,028
because ultimately you have to
jump these compliance hoops.

3733
03:08:14,029 --> 03:08:17,417
It comes, like BlockFi can give you yield,

3734
03:08:17,416 --> 03:08:19,873
but they have to do it in compliant way

3735
03:08:19,873 --> 03:08:22,020
with the United States jurisdiction.

3736
03:08:22,020 --> 03:08:24,039
So ultimately those applications

3737
03:08:24,039 --> 03:08:28,956
to use that digital property
and either generate a loan on,

3738
03:08:30,430 --> 03:08:32,382
give you a loan on it,
or give you yield on it,

3739
03:08:32,382 --> 03:08:34,050
are gonna come from companies.

3740
03:08:34,050 --> 03:08:37,132
But the difference, the
fundamental difference

3741
03:08:37,132 --> 03:08:41,745
is it could be companies
anywhere in the world.

3742
03:08:41,745 --> 03:08:44,421
So if a company in Singapore comes up

3743
03:08:44,422 --> 03:08:47,635
with a better offering, right?

3744
03:08:47,635 --> 03:08:50,461
Then the capital is gonna
start to flow to Singapore.

3745
03:08:50,461 --> 03:08:55,042
I can't send 10 steady
blocks of LA to Singapore

3746
03:08:55,042 --> 03:08:57,870
to rent during a festival.
- [Lex] Yeah.

3747
03:08:57,870 --> 03:09:02,058
- But I can send 10 blocks
of Bitcoin to Singapore.

3748
03:09:02,058 --> 03:09:05,112
So you've got a truly global
market that's functioning

3749
03:09:05,112 --> 03:09:08,305
and this asset and is
their second order asset.

3750
03:09:08,306 --> 03:09:11,119
For example, maybe you're
an American citizen

3751
03:09:11,119 --> 03:09:13,664
and you own 10 Bitcoin
and someone in Singapore

3752
03:09:13,664 --> 03:09:16,793
will generate 27% yield in the Bitcoin,

3753
03:09:16,793 --> 03:09:19,421
but legally you can't
send the money to them

3754
03:09:19,421 --> 03:09:21,413
or the Bitcoin to them, it doesn't matter,

3755
03:09:21,413 --> 03:09:23,531
because the fact that that exists

3756
03:09:23,531 --> 03:09:25,247
means that someone in Hong Kong

3757
03:09:25,246 --> 03:09:29,592
will borrow the 10 Bitcoin
from somebody in New York,

3758
03:09:29,593 --> 03:09:32,905
and then they will put on
the trade in Singapore,

3759
03:09:32,905 --> 03:09:35,113
and that will create a demand for Bitcoin,

3760
03:09:35,112 --> 03:09:36,906
which will drive up the price of Bitcoin,

3761
03:09:36,906 --> 03:09:40,634
which will result in an
effective tax-free yield

3762
03:09:40,635 --> 03:09:41,797
for the person in the US

3763
03:09:41,797 --> 03:09:44,068
that's not even in the jurisdiction.

3764
03:09:44,067 --> 03:09:47,127
So there's nothing that's
going on in Singapore

3765
03:09:47,128 --> 03:09:50,639
to drive up the price of your land in LA.

3766
03:09:50,638 --> 03:09:53,770
But there is something going
on everywhere in the world

3767
03:09:53,771 --> 03:09:56,962
to drive up the price of
property and cyberspace

3768
03:09:56,962 --> 03:10:00,033
if there's only one digital Manhattan.

3769
03:10:00,033 --> 03:10:02,717
And so there's a dynamic there,

3770
03:10:02,717 --> 03:10:06,188
which is profound because it's global.

3771
03:10:06,188 --> 03:10:07,819
But now let's go to the next extreme.

3772
03:10:07,819 --> 03:10:11,418
I'm still giving you a
fairly conventional idea,

3773
03:10:11,418 --> 03:10:15,988
which is let's just loan the
money fast on a global network

3774
03:10:15,988 --> 03:10:19,836
and let's just rent the hotel
room fast in cyberspace.

3775
03:10:19,836 --> 03:10:24,086
But now let's move to maybe
a more innovative idea.

3776
03:10:24,936 --> 03:10:27,191
The first generation of internet

3777
03:10:27,191 --> 03:10:29,281
brought a lot of productivity,

3778
03:10:29,281 --> 03:10:32,136
but there's also just
a lot of flaws in it.

3779
03:10:32,137 --> 03:10:34,764
For example, Twitter is full of garbage.

3780
03:10:34,763 --> 03:10:37,615
Instagram DMs are full of garbage.

3781
03:10:37,615 --> 03:10:39,856
Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage.

3782
03:10:39,856 --> 03:10:42,344
YouTube is full of scams.

3783
03:10:42,344 --> 03:10:45,101
Every 15 minutes there's a
Michael Saylor Bitcoin giveaway

3784
03:10:45,102 --> 03:10:46,681
spun up on YouTube.
- [Lex] Yep.

3785
03:10:46,681 --> 03:10:50,254
- My Office 365 inbox,
it's full of garbage,

3786
03:10:50,254 --> 03:10:53,083
millions of spam messages.

3787
03:10:53,083 --> 03:10:57,097
I'm running four different email filters.

3788
03:10:57,097 --> 03:10:59,102
My company spends million dollars a year

3789
03:10:59,102 --> 03:11:00,765
to fight denial of service attacks

3790
03:11:00,764 --> 03:11:03,305
and all sorts of other security things.

3791
03:11:03,306 --> 03:11:05,837
There are denial of
service attacks everywhere

3792
03:11:05,837 --> 03:11:09,649
against everybody in
cyberspace all the time.

3793
03:11:09,649 --> 03:11:10,600
It's extreme.

3794
03:11:10,601 --> 03:11:12,905
And we're all beset with hostility, right?

3795
03:11:12,905 --> 03:11:14,974
You've been a victim of it on Twitter.

3796
03:11:14,974 --> 03:11:18,933
You go on Twitter and people post stuff

3797
03:11:18,933 --> 03:11:20,633
they would never say to your face.

3798
03:11:20,632 --> 03:11:21,875
And then if you look, you find out

3799
03:11:21,875 --> 03:11:25,097
that the account was
created like three days ago

3800
03:11:25,097 --> 03:11:27,807
and it's not even a real person.

3801
03:11:27,808 --> 03:11:30,949
So, we're beset with phishing attacks

3802
03:11:30,949 --> 03:11:35,372
and scams and spam bots
and garbage and why?

3803
03:11:35,371 --> 03:11:37,555
And the answer is because
the first generation

3804
03:11:37,555 --> 03:11:41,270
of internet was digital
information and there's no energy.

3805
03:11:41,270 --> 03:11:44,771
There's no conservation
of energy in cyberspace.

3806
03:11:44,771 --> 03:11:47,076
The thing that makes the universe work

3807
03:11:47,075 --> 03:11:49,044
is conservation of energy.

3808
03:11:49,045 --> 03:11:51,628
Like if I went to a hotel room,

3809
03:11:52,978 --> 03:11:54,521
I'd have to post a credit card,

3810
03:11:54,522 --> 03:11:57,633
and then if I smashed the place up,

3811
03:11:57,632 --> 03:11:59,828
there'd be economic consequences,

3812
03:11:59,828 --> 03:12:02,976
maybe there'd be criminal consequences,

3813
03:12:02,977 --> 03:12:06,073
there might be reputational consequences.

3814
03:12:06,073 --> 03:12:08,130
A lamp might fall on me.

3815
03:12:08,129 --> 03:12:09,283
But in the worst case thing,

3816
03:12:09,283 --> 03:12:11,787
I can only smash up one hotel room.

3817
03:12:11,787 --> 03:12:15,347
Now imagine I could actually
write a Python script

3818
03:12:15,347 --> 03:12:18,432
to send myself to every
hotel room in the world,

3819
03:12:18,432 --> 03:12:21,104
every minute, not post a credit card

3820
03:12:21,103 --> 03:12:23,936
and smash them all up anonymously.

3821
03:12:25,994 --> 03:12:29,298
The thing that makes the
universe work is friction,

3822
03:12:29,298 --> 03:12:31,850
speed of sound, speed of light.

3823
03:12:31,850 --> 03:12:35,527
And the fact that it's
ultimately, it's conservative.

3824
03:12:35,527 --> 03:12:37,493
You're either energy or your matter,

3825
03:12:37,493 --> 03:12:39,899
but once you've used
the energy, it's gone.

3826
03:12:39,898 --> 03:12:42,897
And you can't do infinite everything.

3827
03:12:42,897 --> 03:12:46,106
That's missing in cyberspace right now.

3828
03:12:46,106 --> 03:12:49,826
And if you look at all
of the moral hazards

3829
03:12:49,826 --> 03:12:52,859
and all of the product
defects that we have

3830
03:12:52,860 --> 03:12:57,527
in all of these products,
most of them, 99% of them

3831
03:12:58,496 --> 03:13:02,131
could be cured if we
introduced conservation

3832
03:13:02,131 --> 03:13:04,298
of energy into cyberspace.

3833
03:13:05,393 --> 03:13:06,615
And that's what you can do

3834
03:13:06,615 --> 03:13:10,361
with high speed digital
property, high speed Bitcoin.

3835
03:13:10,361 --> 03:13:13,787
And by high speed, I mean,
not 20 transactions a day.

3836
03:13:13,787 --> 03:13:16,697
I mean, 20,000 transactions a day.

3837
03:13:16,697 --> 03:13:19,239
So, how do you do that?

3838
03:13:19,239 --> 03:13:23,239
Well, I let everybody on
Twitter post a thousand

3839
03:13:24,390 --> 03:13:27,472
or 10,000 satoshis via Lightning wallet,

3840
03:13:27,472 --> 03:13:31,618
a Lightning badge, gimme an orange check.

3841
03:13:31,618 --> 03:13:34,181
If you put up 20 bucks once in your life,

3842
03:13:34,181 --> 03:13:39,131
you could give 300 million
people an orange check.

3843
03:13:39,130 --> 03:13:42,242
Right now you don't
have a blue check, Lex.

3844
03:13:42,243 --> 03:13:43,076
You're a famous person.

3845
03:13:43,075 --> 03:13:45,277
I don't know why you
don't have a blue check.

3846
03:13:45,278 --> 03:13:47,134
Have you ever applied for a blue check?

3847
03:13:47,134 --> 03:13:47,967
- No.

3848
03:13:47,967 --> 03:13:51,444
- There are 360,000 people
on Twitter with a blue check.

3849
03:13:51,444 --> 03:13:54,725
There are 300 million people on Twitter.

3850
03:13:54,725 --> 03:13:58,225
So the conventional way to verify accounts

3851
03:14:00,279 --> 03:14:02,442
is elitist, archaic.

3852
03:14:02,441 --> 03:14:03,898
- Yeah, how does it work?

3853
03:14:03,898 --> 03:14:05,182
How do you get blue check?

3854
03:14:05,183 --> 03:14:07,142
- You gotta apply and wait six months

3855
03:14:07,141 --> 03:14:10,441
and you have to post like three articles

3856
03:14:10,441 --> 03:14:12,847
in the public mainstream media.

3857
03:14:12,847 --> 03:14:13,681
- Sure.

3858
03:14:13,681 --> 03:14:15,456
- That illustrates you're
a person of interest.

3859
03:14:15,456 --> 03:14:16,289
- [Lex] Interesting.

3860
03:14:16,289 --> 03:14:17,358
- Generally, they would grant them

3861
03:14:17,358 --> 03:14:19,691
to CEOs of public companies,

3862
03:14:20,689 --> 03:14:24,171
or the whole idea is
to verify that you are

3863
03:14:24,171 --> 03:14:26,389
who you say you are.
- [Lex] Yeah, who you are.

3864
03:14:26,389 --> 03:14:27,222
Right.

3865
03:14:27,222 --> 03:14:29,576
- But the question is, why
isn't everybody verified?

3866
03:14:29,576 --> 03:14:31,756
And there's a couple of threads on that.

3867
03:14:31,756 --> 03:14:34,306
One, is some people don't wanna be doxed,

3868
03:14:34,306 --> 03:14:36,550
they wanna be anonymous.
- [Lex] Sure.

3869
03:14:36,549 --> 03:14:40,581
- But they're even anonymous
people that should be verified.

3870
03:14:40,582 --> 03:14:45,582
Because otherwise you're
subjecting their entire following

3871
03:14:45,759 --> 03:14:50,255
to phishing attacks and
scams and hostility.

3872
03:14:50,255 --> 03:14:51,292
But the other-

3873
03:14:51,292 --> 03:14:53,180
- What's the orange verification?

3874
03:14:53,180 --> 03:14:55,595
So this idea, can you actually elaborate

3875
03:14:55,594 --> 03:14:57,879
a little bit more if you put up 20 bucks?

3876
03:14:57,879 --> 03:14:59,998
- Yeah, I think everybody
on Twitter ought be able

3877
03:14:59,998 --> 03:15:03,257
to get an orange check if they
could come up with like $10.

3878
03:15:03,257 --> 03:15:06,075
- And what is the power
of that orange check?

3879
03:15:06,075 --> 03:15:08,693
What does that verify exactly?

3880
03:15:08,693 --> 03:15:11,475
- You basically post a security deposit

3881
03:15:11,475 --> 03:15:14,200
for your safe patches through cyberspace.

3882
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:16,018
So the way it would work is

3883
03:15:16,018 --> 03:15:19,179
if you've got $10 once in your life,

3884
03:15:19,179 --> 03:15:22,316
you can basically show
that you're credit worthy.

3885
03:15:22,316 --> 03:15:24,935
And that's your pledge to me

3886
03:15:24,934 --> 03:15:27,595
that you're gonna act responsibly.

3887
03:15:27,595 --> 03:15:31,574
So you put the 10 of the $20
into the Lightning wallet,

3888
03:15:31,575 --> 03:15:33,547
you get an orange check.

3889
03:15:33,547 --> 03:15:36,675
Then Twitter just gives you
a setting where I can say,

3890
03:15:36,674 --> 03:15:38,662
the only people that can
DM me are orange checks.

3891
03:15:38,663 --> 03:15:39,975
The only people that can post on my tweets

3892
03:15:39,975 --> 03:15:41,806
are orange checks.

3893
03:15:41,806 --> 03:15:43,599
So instead of locking out the public

3894
03:15:43,599 --> 03:15:46,807
and just letting your followers comment,

3895
03:15:46,807 --> 03:15:49,856
you lock out all the unverified.

3896
03:15:49,856 --> 03:15:51,421
And that means people
that don't wanna post

3897
03:15:51,421 --> 03:15:54,896
$10 security deposit can't comment.

3898
03:15:54,896 --> 03:15:57,112
Once you've done those two things,

3899
03:15:57,111 --> 03:16:01,394
then you're in a position
to monetize malice.

3900
03:16:01,395 --> 03:16:04,331
Right, monetize motion or
malice for that matter.

3901
03:16:04,331 --> 03:16:06,561
But let's just say for
the sake of argument,

3902
03:16:06,561 --> 03:16:10,061
you post something and 9,700 bots spin up,

3903
03:16:11,670 --> 03:16:14,170
and pitch their whatever scam.

3904
03:16:15,645 --> 03:16:18,363
Right now you sit and
you go report, report,

3905
03:16:18,363 --> 03:16:20,774
report, report, report, report.

3906
03:16:20,774 --> 03:16:23,877
And if you spend an hour,
you get through half of them,

3907
03:16:23,878 --> 03:16:25,868
you waste an hour of your life

3908
03:16:25,868 --> 03:16:27,924
and they just spin up another 97 kazillion

3909
03:16:27,924 --> 03:16:29,942
because they've got a Python
script spinning it up,

3910
03:16:29,941 --> 03:16:31,686
so it's hopeless.

3911
03:16:31,686 --> 03:16:33,837
But on the other hand, if you report them

3912
03:16:33,837 --> 03:16:37,093
and they really are a bot,
Twitter's got a method

3913
03:16:37,093 --> 03:16:39,905
to actually delete the account.

3914
03:16:39,906 --> 03:16:41,369
They know that they're bots.

3915
03:16:41,369 --> 03:16:42,891
The problem is not they don't know

3916
03:16:42,891 --> 03:16:44,055
how to delete the account.

3917
03:16:44,055 --> 03:16:45,740
The problem is there are no consequences

3918
03:16:45,740 --> 03:16:47,003
when they delete the account.

3919
03:16:47,003 --> 03:16:51,298
So if there are consequences
Twitter could give,

3920
03:16:51,298 --> 03:16:54,110
they could just seize
the $10 or seize the $20,

3921
03:16:54,110 --> 03:16:57,507
'cause it's a bot, it's
a malicious criminal act

3922
03:16:57,506 --> 03:17:01,880
or whatever as a violation
of the platform rules.

3923
03:17:01,880 --> 03:17:04,871
You end up seizing $10,000,
give half the money

3924
03:17:04,871 --> 03:17:08,649
to the reporter and half the
money to the Twitter platform.

3925
03:17:08,649 --> 03:17:10,021
- That's a really powerful idea,

3926
03:17:10,022 --> 03:17:13,171
but that's tying it,
that's adding friction

3927
03:17:13,171 --> 03:17:16,738
akin to the kind of friction
you have in the physical world.

3928
03:17:16,738 --> 03:17:18,296
You're tying, you have consequences.

3929
03:17:18,296 --> 03:17:19,751
You have real consequences.

3930
03:17:19,751 --> 03:17:21,764
- [Michael] There's putting
conservation of energy.

3931
03:17:21,764 --> 03:17:22,751
- Conservation of energy.

3932
03:17:22,752 --> 03:17:23,753
- There's no friction,

3933
03:17:23,753 --> 03:17:26,202
there's no nothing on this earth, right?

3934
03:17:26,201 --> 03:17:28,217
I mean, you can't walk across the room

3935
03:17:28,218 --> 03:17:29,539
without friction, right?

3936
03:17:29,539 --> 03:17:32,039
So friction is not bad, right?

3937
03:17:32,989 --> 03:17:35,323
Unnecessary friction is bad.

3938
03:17:38,343 --> 03:17:39,325
So in this particular case,

3939
03:17:39,325 --> 03:17:42,615
you're introducing conservation of energy

3940
03:17:42,615 --> 03:17:44,259
and in essence you're
introducing the concept

3941
03:17:44,259 --> 03:17:47,592
of consequence or truth into cyberspace.

3942
03:17:48,603 --> 03:17:52,253
And that means if you do wanna
spin up 10 million fakes,

3943
03:17:52,254 --> 03:17:55,141
fake Lex Fridmans, right?

3944
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:56,103
- [Lex] Its gonna cost.

3945
03:17:56,103 --> 03:17:58,050
- It's gonna cost you a
hundred million dollars

3946
03:17:58,050 --> 03:18:00,497
to spin up 10 million fake Lexes.

3947
03:18:00,497 --> 03:18:02,422
- But the thing is, you could
do that with the dollar,

3948
03:18:02,423 --> 03:18:06,423
but your case, you're
saying that it's more tied

3949
03:18:07,358 --> 03:18:10,495
to physical reality when
you do that with Bitcoin?

3950
03:18:10,495 --> 03:18:14,061
- Yeah, well, let's follow
up on that idea a bit more.

3951
03:18:14,061 --> 03:18:17,614
If you did do it with the
dollar, then the question is,

3952
03:18:17,614 --> 03:18:21,884
how does 6 billion people
deposit the dollars, right?

3953
03:18:21,884 --> 03:18:23,856
Because what you're doing is, yeah,

3954
03:18:23,856 --> 03:18:25,975
could you do it with a credit card?

3955
03:18:25,975 --> 03:18:28,067
Like how do you send dollars?

3956
03:18:28,066 --> 03:18:30,525
Well, you have to dox yourself.

3957
03:18:30,525 --> 03:18:31,592
Like, it's not easy.

3958
03:18:31,592 --> 03:18:35,654
So you're talking about inputting
a credit card transaction,

3959
03:18:35,654 --> 03:18:38,118
doxing yourself, and now
you've just eliminated

3960
03:18:38,118 --> 03:18:40,352
the 2 billion people that
don't have credit cards

3961
03:18:40,352 --> 03:18:41,658
or don't have banks.

3962
03:18:41,657 --> 03:18:43,157
You've also got a problem with everybody

3963
03:18:43,157 --> 03:18:44,948
that wants to remain anonymous.

3964
03:18:44,948 --> 03:18:47,532
But you've also got this other problem,

3965
03:18:47,532 --> 03:18:51,615
which is credit cards are
expensive transactions,

3966
03:18:52,493 --> 03:18:55,872
low frequency, slow settlement.

3967
03:18:55,871 --> 03:18:58,867
So do you really want to pay 2.5%

3968
03:18:58,867 --> 03:19:02,868
every time you actually
show a $20 deposit?

3969
03:19:02,868 --> 03:19:05,629
And maybe you could do a kludgy version

3970
03:19:05,629 --> 03:19:08,758
of this for a subset of people.

3971
03:19:08,757 --> 03:19:12,060
It's 10% as good if you did it

3972
03:19:12,060 --> 03:19:15,097
with conventional payment rails.

3973
03:19:15,097 --> 03:19:18,347
But what you can't do is the next idea,

3974
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,569
which is I want the orange badge

3975
03:19:22,569 --> 03:19:25,324
to be used to give me safe passage

3976
03:19:25,325 --> 03:19:29,492
through cyberspace tripping
across every platform.

3977
03:19:30,686 --> 03:19:33,327
How do I solve the
denial of service attacks

3978
03:19:33,327 --> 03:19:34,557
against a website?

3979
03:19:34,558 --> 03:19:39,225
I publish a website, you hit
it with a million requests.

3980
03:19:40,370 --> 03:19:42,920
Okay, now how do I deal with that?

3981
03:19:42,921 --> 03:19:44,554
Well, I can lock you out

3982
03:19:44,554 --> 03:19:46,826
and I can make it a zero trust website,

3983
03:19:46,825 --> 03:19:48,693
and then you have to be coming at me

3984
03:19:48,693 --> 03:19:50,416
through a trusted firewall

3985
03:19:50,416 --> 03:19:51,745
or with a trusted credential.

3986
03:19:51,745 --> 03:19:55,000
But that's a pretty draconian thing.

3987
03:19:55,000 --> 03:19:58,656
Or I could put it behind a Lightning wall.

3988
03:19:58,656 --> 03:20:02,254
A Lightning wall would
be I just challenge you,

3989
03:20:02,254 --> 03:20:05,304
Lex, you wanna browse my website?

3990
03:20:05,305 --> 03:20:08,412
You have to show me your a
hundred thousand satoshis.

3991
03:20:08,412 --> 03:20:10,807
Do you have a hundred thousand satoshis?

3992
03:20:10,807 --> 03:20:11,640
Click.

3993
03:20:11,639 --> 03:20:14,338
Okay, now you click away a hundred times

3994
03:20:14,338 --> 03:20:16,069
or a thousand times.

3995
03:20:16,069 --> 03:20:18,167
And after a thousand times, I'm like,

3996
03:20:18,167 --> 03:20:19,574
"Well, now, Lex, you're getting offensive

3997
03:20:19,574 --> 03:20:21,272
to take a satoshi from you,

3998
03:20:21,272 --> 03:20:24,081
or 10 satoshis a micro transaction."

3999
03:20:24,081 --> 03:20:24,956
You wanna hit me a million times?

4000
03:20:24,956 --> 03:20:28,611
I'm taking all your satoshis
and locking you out.

4001
03:20:28,611 --> 03:20:30,454
What you wanna do is you want

4002
03:20:30,453 --> 03:20:35,443
to go through 200 websites
a day and what you want,

4003
03:20:35,443 --> 03:20:39,578
every time you cross a
domain, you need to be able to

4004
03:20:39,578 --> 03:20:43,949
in a split second, prove
that you've got some asset.

4005
03:20:43,949 --> 03:20:46,640
And now when you cross
back, when you exit domain,

4006
03:20:46,640 --> 03:20:49,123
you wanna fetch your asset back.

4007
03:20:49,123 --> 03:20:52,165
So how do I, in a friction free fashion,

4008
03:20:52,165 --> 03:20:55,712
browse through dozens
or hundreds of websites,

4009
03:20:55,712 --> 03:20:58,317
post a security deposit for safe passage,

4010
03:20:58,317 --> 03:21:00,463
and then get it back.

4011
03:21:00,463 --> 03:21:04,221
You couldn't afford to pay
a credit card fee each time.

4012
03:21:04,221 --> 03:21:06,413
When you think about
two point a half percent

4013
03:21:06,414 --> 03:21:09,931
as a transaction fee, it
means you trade the money

4014
03:21:09,931 --> 03:21:11,847
40 times and it's gone.

4015
03:21:13,395 --> 03:21:15,003
- [Lex] (chuckles) Yeah.
- It's gone.

4016
03:21:15,003 --> 03:21:17,393
- Yeah, so you can't do
this kind of hopping around

4017
03:21:17,393 --> 03:21:20,906
through the internet with
this kind of verification

4018
03:21:20,906 --> 03:21:23,146
that grounds you to a physical reality.

4019
03:21:23,146 --> 03:21:25,459
It's a really, really interesting idea.

4020
03:21:25,459 --> 03:21:27,936
Why hasn't that been done?

4021
03:21:27,935 --> 03:21:30,615
- I think you need two things.

4022
03:21:30,615 --> 03:21:34,198
You need an idea like a
digital asset like Bitcoin

4023
03:21:34,198 --> 03:21:36,773
that's a bearer instrument
for final settlement.

4024
03:21:36,772 --> 03:21:40,038
And then you need a high
speed transaction network

4025
03:21:40,039 --> 03:21:43,105
like Lightning where the transaction cost

4026
03:21:43,104 --> 03:21:46,021
might be a 20th of a penny or less.

4027
03:21:47,032 --> 03:21:50,912
And if you roll the clock back 24 months,

4028
03:21:50,912 --> 03:21:54,145
I don't think you had
the Lightning Network

4029
03:21:54,145 --> 03:21:55,840
in a stable point.

4030
03:21:55,840 --> 03:21:57,745
It's really just the past 12 months.

4031
03:21:57,745 --> 03:22:01,725
It's an idea you could
think about this year.

4032
03:22:01,725 --> 03:22:05,308
And I think you need
to be aware of Bitcoin

4033
03:22:06,727 --> 03:22:10,641
as something other than like
a scary speculative asset.

4034
03:22:10,641 --> 03:22:12,703
So I really think we're
just the beginning,

4035
03:22:12,703 --> 03:22:14,376
- The embryonic stage.

4036
03:22:14,376 --> 03:22:16,647
I have to ask Michael Saylor,

4037
03:22:16,647 --> 03:22:20,696
you said before there's
no second best to Bitcoin.

4038
03:22:20,695 --> 03:22:22,398
What would be the second best?

4039
03:22:22,398 --> 03:22:24,555
Traditionally there's
Ethereum with smart contracts,

4040
03:22:24,555 --> 03:22:29,555
Cardano with proof of stake,
Polkadot with interoperability

4041
03:22:29,716 --> 03:22:34,108
between blockchains, Dogecoin
has the incredible power

4042
03:22:34,108 --> 03:22:36,858
of the meme, privacy with Monero.

4043
03:22:38,618 --> 03:22:39,842
I just can keep going.

4044
03:22:39,842 --> 03:22:43,509
There's of course after
the block size wars,

4045
03:22:45,791 --> 03:22:48,742
the different offshoots of Bitcoin.

4046
03:22:48,743 --> 03:22:52,658
- I think if you decompose
or segment the crypto market,

4047
03:22:52,658 --> 03:22:55,074
you've got crypto property,

4048
03:22:55,074 --> 03:22:57,101
Bitcoin is the king of that, you know,

4049
03:22:57,101 --> 03:22:58,386
and other Bitcoin forks that wanted

4050
03:22:58,386 --> 03:23:01,719
to be a bearer instrument store of value

4051
03:23:02,674 --> 03:23:06,117
would be a property, a
Bitcoin Cash or a Litecoin,

4052
03:23:06,118 --> 03:23:07,550
something like that.

4053
03:23:07,549 --> 03:23:11,078
Then you've got cryptocurrencies.

4054
03:23:11,078 --> 03:23:12,746
I don't think Bitcoin's a currency

4055
03:23:12,746 --> 03:23:16,819
because a currency, I define
in nation states sense.

4056
03:23:16,819 --> 03:23:21,069
A currency is a digital
asset that you can transfer

4057
03:23:22,013 --> 03:23:25,924
in a transaction without
incurring a taxable obligation.

4058
03:23:25,924 --> 03:23:27,906
So that means it has to be a stable dollar

4059
03:23:27,906 --> 03:23:31,100
or a stable euro or a
stable yen, a stable coin.

4060
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:33,193
So I think you've got
cryptocurrencies, Tether,

4061
03:23:33,193 --> 03:23:36,700
Circle, most famous, I think
you've got crypto platforms,

4062
03:23:36,700 --> 03:23:40,281
and Ethereum is the most
famous of the crypto platforms,

4063
03:23:40,281 --> 03:23:41,893
the platform upon which, you know,

4064
03:23:41,893 --> 03:23:46,345
with smart contract
functionality, et cetera.

4065
03:23:46,345 --> 03:23:48,315
And then I think you've
got just crypto securities.

4066
03:23:48,316 --> 03:23:52,016
It's just like my favorite
whatever, meme coin.

4067
03:23:52,016 --> 03:23:54,462
And I love it, 'cause I love
it and it's attached to my game

4068
03:23:54,462 --> 03:23:57,518
or my company or my
persona or my whatever.

4069
03:23:57,518 --> 03:24:00,818
I think if you pushed me and said,

4070
03:24:00,818 --> 03:24:02,038
"Well, what's the second best?"

4071
03:24:02,039 --> 03:24:04,591
I would say the world wants two things.

4072
03:24:04,591 --> 03:24:07,397
It wants crypto property
as a savings account,

4073
03:24:07,397 --> 03:24:10,421
and it wants cryptocurrency
as a checking account.

4074
03:24:10,421 --> 03:24:13,597
And that means that the most popular thing

4075
03:24:13,597 --> 03:24:17,637
really is going to be a
stable coin dollar, right?

4076
03:24:17,637 --> 03:24:20,452
There's a maybe a fight right now.

4077
03:24:20,451 --> 03:24:22,112
It might be Tether, right?

4078
03:24:22,112 --> 03:24:25,792
But a stable dollar because I feel like

4079
03:24:25,792 --> 03:24:29,020
the market opportunity, it's not clear

4080
03:24:29,020 --> 03:24:31,013
that there'll be one that will win.

4081
03:24:31,013 --> 03:24:32,851
The class of stable dollars is probably

4082
03:24:32,851 --> 03:24:35,851
a one to $10 trillion market easily.

4083
03:24:37,222 --> 03:24:39,807
I think that in the crypto platform space,

4084
03:24:39,808 --> 03:24:42,257
Ethereum will compete with Solana

4085
03:24:42,256 --> 03:24:45,021
and Binance Smart Chain and the like.

4086
03:24:45,022 --> 03:24:46,831
And are there certain
characteristics of any of them

4087
03:24:46,831 --> 03:24:49,158
that kind of stand out to you?

4088
03:24:49,158 --> 03:24:51,458
Don't you think the competition

4089
03:24:51,458 --> 03:24:53,673
is based on a set of features?

4090
03:24:53,673 --> 03:24:57,931
Also, so the set of features
that a cryptocurrency provides,

4091
03:24:57,931 --> 03:25:00,208
but also the community that it provides.

4092
03:25:00,208 --> 03:25:01,468
Don't you think the community matters

4093
03:25:01,468 --> 03:25:04,300
and sort of the adoption,
the dynamic of the adoption

4094
03:25:04,299 --> 03:25:05,939
both across the developers
and the investors.

4095
03:25:05,940 --> 03:25:10,697
- And if I'm looking at them,
I mean the first question

4096
03:25:10,697 --> 03:25:12,608
is what's the regulatory risk,

4097
03:25:12,608 --> 03:25:15,996
how likely is it to be deemed
a property versus security?

4098
03:25:15,995 --> 03:25:19,516
And the second is what's
the competitive risk?

4099
03:25:19,516 --> 03:25:22,932
And the third is what's the
speed and the performance.

4100
03:25:22,933 --> 03:25:26,614
And all those things lead to the question

4101
03:25:26,613 --> 03:25:28,509
of what's the security risk?

4102
03:25:28,509 --> 03:25:30,736
How likely is it to crash and burn,

4103
03:25:30,736 --> 03:25:33,486
and how stable or unstable is it?

4104
03:25:34,450 --> 03:25:36,896
And then there's the marketing risk.

4105
03:25:36,896 --> 03:25:38,141
I mean, there are different teams

4106
03:25:38,141 --> 03:25:42,266
behind each of these things
and communities behind them.

4107
03:25:42,266 --> 03:25:47,183
I think that the big cloud
looming over the crypto industry

4108
03:25:49,135 --> 03:25:51,529
is regulatory treatment
of cryptocurrencies

4109
03:25:51,529 --> 03:25:53,988
and regulatory treatment
of crypto securities

4110
03:25:53,988 --> 03:25:55,251
and crypto platforms.

4111
03:25:55,251 --> 03:25:56,447
And I think that won't be determined

4112
03:25:56,447 --> 03:25:58,933
until the end of the first
Biden administration.

4113
03:25:58,933 --> 03:26:02,459
For example, there are
people that would like

4114
03:26:02,459 --> 03:26:07,154
only US FDIC insured banks
to issue cryptocurrencies.

4115
03:26:07,154 --> 03:26:08,766
They want JP Morgan to issue

4116
03:26:08,766 --> 03:26:12,171
a crypto dollar backed one-to-one.

4117
03:26:12,171 --> 03:26:14,338
But then in the US
right now we have Circle

4118
03:26:14,338 --> 03:26:18,054
and we have other companies
that are licensed entities

4119
03:26:18,054 --> 03:26:20,279
that are backed by cash
and cash equivalents,

4120
03:26:20,279 --> 03:26:22,757
but they're not FDIC insured banks.

4121
03:26:22,757 --> 03:26:24,550
There's also a debate in Congress about

4122
03:26:24,550 --> 03:26:26,674
whether state chartered
banks should be able

4123
03:26:26,674 --> 03:26:27,885
to issue these things.

4124
03:26:27,886 --> 03:26:30,719
And then we have Tether and others

4125
03:26:31,822 --> 03:26:34,996
that are outside of the US jurisdiction,

4126
03:26:34,995 --> 03:26:37,157
they're probably not backed
by cash and cash equivalents.

4127
03:26:37,157 --> 03:26:38,706
They're backed by stuff.

4128
03:26:38,706 --> 03:26:40,676
And we don't know what stuff.

4129
03:26:40,676 --> 03:26:43,676
And then finally you have UST and D,

4130
03:26:45,070 --> 03:26:47,467
which are algorithmic stable coins, right?

4131
03:26:47,467 --> 03:26:50,614
That are even more innovative,

4132
03:26:50,614 --> 03:26:53,027
further outside the compliance framework.

4133
03:26:53,027 --> 03:26:54,677
So if you ask who's gonna win?

4134
03:26:54,677 --> 03:26:58,689
The question is really, I don't
know, will the market decide

4135
03:26:58,689 --> 03:27:00,721
or will the regulators decide.

4136
03:27:00,721 --> 03:27:03,558
If the regulator get outta the
way and the market fought up?

4137
03:27:03,558 --> 03:27:05,500
Well, then it's an interesting discussion.

4138
03:27:05,501 --> 03:27:06,334
- [Lex] Yeah.

4139
03:27:06,334 --> 03:27:09,005
- And then I think that all bets are off

4140
03:27:09,004 --> 03:27:12,009
if the regulators get more
heavy handed with this.

4141
03:27:12,010 --> 03:27:13,380
And I think you could
have the same discussion

4142
03:27:13,379 --> 03:27:16,839
with crypto properties
like the DeFi exchanges

4143
03:27:16,840 --> 03:27:18,255
and the crypto exchanges.

4144
03:27:18,255 --> 03:27:21,255
The SEC would like to
regulate the crypto exchanges.

4145
03:27:21,255 --> 03:27:23,201
They like to regulate the DeFi exchanges.

4146
03:27:23,201 --> 03:27:25,777
That means they may regulate
the crypto platforms

4147
03:27:25,777 --> 03:27:29,690
and at what rate and in what fashion.

4148
03:27:29,690 --> 03:27:32,676
And so I think that I
could give you an opinion

4149
03:27:32,676 --> 03:27:34,445
if it was limited to competition

4150
03:27:34,445 --> 03:27:37,445
under the current regulatory regime.

4151
03:27:38,414 --> 03:27:43,414
But I think that the
regulations are so fast moving

4152
03:27:43,462 --> 03:27:48,296
and it's so uncertain that
it's, you can't make a decision

4153
03:27:51,709 --> 03:27:56,423
without considering the potential
actions of the regulators.

4154
03:27:56,423 --> 03:27:58,574
- I hope the regulators
get out of the way.

4155
03:27:58,574 --> 03:28:02,085
Can you steelman the
case that Dogecoin is,

4156
03:28:02,084 --> 03:28:04,197
I guess the second best cryptocurrency

4157
03:28:04,198 --> 03:28:06,900
or if you don't consider
Bitcoin a cryptocurrency,

4158
03:28:06,900 --> 03:28:09,448
but instead of crypto property.

4159
03:28:09,448 --> 03:28:11,768
- I would classify it as crypto property

4160
03:28:11,768 --> 03:28:13,823
because the US dollar is a currency.

4161
03:28:13,823 --> 03:28:17,416
So unless your crypto asset
is pegged algorithmically

4162
03:28:17,415 --> 03:28:20,349
or stably to the value of
the dollar is not a currency,

4163
03:28:20,350 --> 03:28:23,279
it's a property or it's an asset.

4164
03:28:23,279 --> 03:28:25,908
- So then can you steelman the case

4165
03:28:25,907 --> 03:28:29,546
that Dogecoin is the
best cryptocurrency then,

4166
03:28:29,546 --> 03:28:33,238
because Bitcoin is not even in that list.

4167
03:28:33,238 --> 03:28:36,620
- The debate is gonna be whether
it's property or security,

4168
03:28:36,620 --> 03:28:39,618
and there's a debate whether
it's decentralized enough.

4169
03:28:39,619 --> 03:28:42,177
So let's assume it was decentralized.

4170
03:28:42,177 --> 03:28:43,070
- Yep.

4171
03:28:43,070 --> 03:28:45,808
- Well, it's increasing at not quite five,

4172
03:28:45,808 --> 03:28:47,545
what 5% a year inflation rate.

4173
03:28:47,546 --> 03:28:50,274
But it's not 5% exponentially,

4174
03:28:50,274 --> 03:28:55,274
it's like a plus 5 million, 5%,
something capped in is less.

4175
03:28:56,623 --> 03:28:58,158
I forget the exact number,

4176
03:28:58,158 --> 03:29:00,578
but it's an inflationary property.

4177
03:29:00,578 --> 03:29:05,105
It's got a lower inflation
rate than the US dollar,

4178
03:29:05,105 --> 03:29:07,721
and it's got a much lower inflation rate

4179
03:29:07,721 --> 03:29:10,506
than many other fiat currencies.

4180
03:29:10,506 --> 03:29:12,287
So, I think you could say that.

4181
03:29:12,287 --> 03:29:16,927
- But don't you see the power
of meme, the power of ideas,

4182
03:29:16,927 --> 03:29:20,430
the power of fun or whatever mechanism

4183
03:29:20,430 --> 03:29:23,180
is used to captivate a community?

4184
03:29:25,851 --> 03:29:27,506
- I do, but there are meme stocks.

4185
03:29:27,505 --> 03:29:30,296
It doesn't absolve you of your ethical

4186
03:29:30,296 --> 03:29:34,288
and securities liabilities
if you're promoting it.

4187
03:29:34,288 --> 03:29:36,177
So like I don't have a problem

4188
03:29:36,177 --> 03:29:39,476
with like people buying a stock.

4189
03:29:39,476 --> 03:29:43,663
It's just the way I
divide the world is right,

4190
03:29:43,663 --> 03:29:45,745
there's investment, there's saving

4191
03:29:45,745 --> 03:29:49,412
and there's speculation
and there's trading.

4192
03:29:50,691 --> 03:29:53,721
So Bitcoin is an asset for saving.

4193
03:29:53,720 --> 03:29:56,049
If you wanna save money
for a hundred years,

4194
03:29:56,049 --> 03:29:59,663
you don't really want to
take on execution risk

4195
03:29:59,664 --> 03:30:01,380
or the like, so you're just buying

4196
03:30:01,379 --> 03:30:03,288
something to hold forever.

4197
03:30:03,289 --> 03:30:07,969
For you to actually endorse
something as a property.

4198
03:30:07,968 --> 03:30:09,015
Like if you said to me, "Mike,

4199
03:30:09,015 --> 03:30:11,636
what should I buy for the
next a hundred years?"

4200
03:30:11,637 --> 03:30:13,293
I say, "Well, some amount of real estate,

4201
03:30:13,292 --> 03:30:15,488
some amount of scarce collectibles,

4202
03:30:15,488 --> 03:30:17,841
some amount of Bitcoin," right?

4203
03:30:17,842 --> 03:30:19,986
You can run your company, right?

4204
03:30:19,986 --> 03:30:22,137
But running your company as an investment,

4205
03:30:22,137 --> 03:30:24,805
so the savings are properties.

4206
03:30:24,805 --> 03:30:25,939
If you said, "What should I invest in?"

4207
03:30:25,939 --> 03:30:28,594
I'd say, "Well, here's a
list of good companies,

4208
03:30:28,593 --> 03:30:30,427
private companies, you could
start your own company."

4209
03:30:30,427 --> 03:30:32,761
That's an investment, right?

4210
03:30:34,474 --> 03:30:36,667
If you said, "What should I trade?"

4211
03:30:36,667 --> 03:30:39,101
Well, I'm trading as
like a proprietary thing.

4212
03:30:39,101 --> 03:30:43,409
Like I don't have any
special insight into that.

4213
03:30:43,409 --> 03:30:44,858
If you're a good trader, you know you are.

4214
03:30:44,858 --> 03:30:48,233
If you said to me, "What
should you speculate in?"

4215
03:30:48,233 --> 03:30:52,032
We talk about meme stocks,
right, and meme coins,

4216
03:30:52,031 --> 03:30:54,947
and it's kind of sits up there.

4217
03:30:54,947 --> 03:30:56,197
It sits right in the same space

4218
03:30:56,197 --> 03:30:58,413
with what horse should you bet on

4219
03:30:58,413 --> 03:31:00,947
and what sports team should you gamble on?

4220
03:31:00,947 --> 03:31:03,070
And should you bet on
black six times in a row

4221
03:31:03,070 --> 03:31:04,887
and double down each time?

4222
03:31:04,888 --> 03:31:09,038
I mean, it's fun, but
at the end of the day

4223
03:31:09,038 --> 03:31:11,204
it's a speculation, right?

4224
03:31:12,513 --> 03:31:15,160
You can't build a civilization-

4225
03:31:15,159 --> 03:31:16,096
- On speculation.

4226
03:31:16,096 --> 03:31:16,930
- On it.

4227
03:31:16,930 --> 03:31:18,605
It's not an institutional asset.

4228
03:31:18,605 --> 03:31:21,145
And in fact, where I'd leave it, right,

4229
03:31:21,145 --> 03:31:23,690
is Bitcoin is clearly digital,

4230
03:31:23,690 --> 03:31:27,388
which makes it an institutional
grade investible asset

4231
03:31:27,388 --> 03:31:29,404
for a public company, a public figure,

4232
03:31:29,404 --> 03:31:33,128
a public investor or
anybody that's risk adverse.

4233
03:31:33,128 --> 03:31:37,612
I think that the other,
the top 100 other cryptos

4234
03:31:37,611 --> 03:31:40,177
are like venture capital investments.

4235
03:31:40,177 --> 03:31:41,432
And if you're a VC

4236
03:31:41,433 --> 03:31:43,581
and if you're a qualified
technical investor

4237
03:31:43,581 --> 03:31:44,777
and you have a pool of capital

4238
03:31:44,777 --> 03:31:46,581
and you can take that kind of risk,

4239
03:31:46,581 --> 03:31:49,755
then you can parse through
that and form opinions.

4240
03:31:49,755 --> 03:31:52,815
It's just orders of magnitude more risky

4241
03:31:52,816 --> 03:31:55,181
because of competition,
because of ambition

4242
03:31:55,181 --> 03:31:57,347
and because of regulation.

4243
03:31:58,203 --> 03:31:59,712
And if you take the meme coins,

4244
03:31:59,712 --> 03:32:03,777
it's like when some rapper
comes out with a meme coin,

4245
03:32:03,777 --> 03:32:07,585
it's like maybe it'll peak
when I hear about it, right?

4246
03:32:07,584 --> 03:32:11,367
It's like, I mean, Shib
was created as the coin

4247
03:32:11,368 --> 03:32:15,056
such that it had so many
zeros after the decimal point

4248
03:32:15,056 --> 03:32:18,079
that when you looked
at it on the exchanges,

4249
03:32:18,079 --> 03:32:19,913
it always showed 0000.

4250
03:32:21,012 --> 03:32:24,462
And it wasn't until like six
months after it got popular

4251
03:32:24,461 --> 03:32:26,365
that they started expanding the display,

4252
03:32:26,365 --> 03:32:27,915
so you could see whether
the price had changed.

4253
03:32:27,915 --> 03:32:29,665
- That's speculation.

4254
03:32:31,091 --> 03:32:32,796
Maybe you can correct me,

4255
03:32:32,796 --> 03:32:34,396
but you've been critical of Elon Musk

4256
03:32:34,396 --> 03:32:37,431
in the past in the crypto space.

4257
03:32:37,431 --> 03:32:40,060
Where do you stand on
Elon's effect on Bitcoin

4258
03:32:40,060 --> 03:32:42,744
and cryptocurrency in general these days?

4259
03:32:42,744 --> 03:32:46,284
- I believe that Bitcoin
is a massive breakthrough

4260
03:32:46,283 --> 03:32:49,331
for the human race that
will cure half the problems

4261
03:32:49,331 --> 03:32:52,197
in the world and generate
hundreds of trillions of dollars

4262
03:32:52,197 --> 03:32:55,231
of economic value to the civilization.

4263
03:32:55,231 --> 03:32:58,648
And I believe that it's in an early stage

4264
03:32:59,889 --> 03:33:02,224
where many people don't understand it

4265
03:33:02,224 --> 03:33:03,833
and they're afraid of it.

4266
03:33:03,833 --> 03:33:07,191
And there's FUD and there's
uncertainty, there's doubt

4267
03:33:07,191 --> 03:33:10,875
and there's fear and there's
a very noisy crypto world

4268
03:33:10,875 --> 03:33:15,875
and there's 15,000 other cryptos
that are seeking relevance.

4269
03:33:17,127 --> 03:33:20,742
And I think most of the
FUD is actually fueled

4270
03:33:20,742 --> 03:33:23,130
by the other crypto entrepreneurs.

4271
03:33:23,129 --> 03:33:27,846
So the environmental FUD and
the other types of uncertainty

4272
03:33:27,846 --> 03:33:30,954
that surround Bitcoin,
generally they're not coming

4273
03:33:30,954 --> 03:33:33,230
from legitimate environmentalists.

4274
03:33:33,230 --> 03:33:36,452
They don't come from legitimate critics.

4275
03:33:36,452 --> 03:33:39,756
They actually are guerilla
marketing campaigns

4276
03:33:39,756 --> 03:33:42,220
that are being financed and fueled

4277
03:33:42,220 --> 03:33:45,250
by other crypto entrepreneurs

4278
03:33:45,250 --> 03:33:48,813
because they have an interest in doing so.

4279
03:33:48,813 --> 03:33:52,646
So if I look at the
constructive path forward.

4280
03:33:54,122 --> 03:33:56,565
First, I think it'd be very constructive

4281
03:33:56,566 --> 03:34:00,121
for corporations to embrace Bitcoin

4282
03:34:00,120 --> 03:34:03,534
and build applications on top of it.

4283
03:34:03,534 --> 03:34:05,968
You don't need to fix it.

4284
03:34:05,968 --> 03:34:07,861
There's nothing wrong with it, right?

4285
03:34:07,861 --> 03:34:10,093
Like when you put it on a
layer two and a layer three,

4286
03:34:10,093 --> 03:34:13,671
it moves a billion times a
second at the speed of light.

4287
03:34:13,671 --> 03:34:17,171
So every beautiful, cool DeFi application,

4288
03:34:18,236 --> 03:34:21,320
every crypto application,
everything you could imagine

4289
03:34:21,319 --> 03:34:25,986
you might wanna do, you can
do with a legitimate company

4290
03:34:27,219 --> 03:34:30,567
and a legitimate website
or mobile application

4291
03:34:30,567 --> 03:34:35,067
sitting on top of Bitcoin
or Lightning if you want to.

4292
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:40,653
So I think that to the
extent that people do that,

4293
03:34:40,653 --> 03:34:43,172
that's gonna be better for the world.

4294
03:34:43,172 --> 03:34:45,007
If you consider what holds people back,

4295
03:34:45,007 --> 03:34:49,591
I think it's just misperceptions
about what Bitcoin is.

4296
03:34:50,797 --> 03:34:54,917
So I'm a big fan of just educating people.

4297
03:34:54,916 --> 03:34:57,697
If you're not going to commercialize it,

4298
03:34:57,697 --> 03:34:59,876
then just educate people on what it is.

4299
03:34:59,876 --> 03:35:03,542
So for example, Bitcoin's
the most efficient

4300
03:35:04,497 --> 03:35:07,432
use of energy in the world by far, right?

4301
03:35:07,433 --> 03:35:09,714
Most people don't, they don't
necessarily perceive that

4302
03:35:09,713 --> 03:35:10,888
or realize that.

4303
03:35:10,888 --> 03:35:14,772
But if you were to take any
metric energy intensity,

4304
03:35:14,772 --> 03:35:17,680
you put like $2 billion
worth of electricity

4305
03:35:17,681 --> 03:35:22,585
in the network every year
and it's worth $850 billion.

4306
03:35:22,584 --> 03:35:26,495
There is no industry in
the real world, right,

4307
03:35:26,495 --> 03:35:29,055
that is that energy efficient.

4308
03:35:29,056 --> 03:35:30,310
Not only that energy efficient,

4309
03:35:30,309 --> 03:35:32,722
it's also the most sustainable industry.

4310
03:35:32,722 --> 03:35:37,722
We do surveys, 58% of Bitcoin
mining energy is sustainable.

4311
03:35:38,506 --> 03:35:41,200
So there's a very good story.

4312
03:35:41,200 --> 03:35:43,780
In fact every other industry,
planes, trains, automobiles,

4313
03:35:43,781 --> 03:35:47,614
construction, food,
medicine, everything else,

4314
03:35:48,654 --> 03:35:51,320
it's less clean, less efficient.

4315
03:35:53,058 --> 03:35:54,088
- So the basic debate was-

4316
03:35:54,087 --> 03:35:56,486
- I would like to, I wouldn't
say there is a debate,

4317
03:35:56,486 --> 03:35:58,268
I would just say that to the extent

4318
03:35:58,269 --> 03:36:00,658
that the Bitcoin community
had any issue with Elon,

4319
03:36:00,658 --> 03:36:04,158
it was just this environmental uncertainty

4320
03:36:07,207 --> 03:36:10,899
that he fueled in a couple
of his tweets, right?

4321
03:36:10,899 --> 03:36:13,664
Which I think just is very distracting.

4322
03:36:13,665 --> 03:36:14,916
- Well, that was one of them.

4323
03:36:14,915 --> 03:36:17,358
But I think it's like
the Bitcoin maximalist,

4324
03:36:17,359 --> 03:36:19,049
but generally the crypto community,

4325
03:36:19,049 --> 03:36:23,064
what you call the crypto entrepreneurs are

4326
03:36:23,064 --> 03:36:28,064
it's also they're using it
for, I mean, for investment,

4327
03:36:28,270 --> 03:36:32,386
for speculation, and
therefore get very passionate

4328
03:36:32,386 --> 03:36:35,739
about people's kind of celebrities,

4329
03:36:35,739 --> 03:36:38,202
including you, like famous people

4330
03:36:38,202 --> 03:36:40,452
saying positive stuff about

4331
03:36:41,587 --> 03:36:43,754
any one particular crypto,

4332
03:36:46,802 --> 03:36:49,252
a thing you can buy in Coinbase.

4333
03:36:49,252 --> 03:36:52,031
And so they might be
unhappy with Elon Musk

4334
03:36:52,031 --> 03:36:55,117
that he's promoting Bitcoin and then not,

4335
03:36:55,117 --> 03:36:57,666
and then promoting Dogecoin, then not.

4336
03:36:57,665 --> 03:37:00,998
And this kind of there's so much emotion

4337
03:37:01,968 --> 03:37:06,126
tied up in the
communication on this topic.

4338
03:37:06,126 --> 03:37:08,297
I think that's where a lot of the-

4339
03:37:08,297 --> 03:37:12,078
- Look, I don't have a
criticism of Elon Musk.

4340
03:37:12,078 --> 03:37:13,979
He's free to do whatever he wishes to do.

4341
03:37:13,979 --> 03:37:14,813
It's his life.

4342
03:37:14,813 --> 03:37:18,146
In fact, Elon Musk is the second largest

4343
03:37:19,372 --> 03:37:21,777
supporter of Bitcoin in the world.

4344
03:37:21,777 --> 03:37:23,201
So I think that the Bitcoin community

4345
03:37:23,201 --> 03:37:25,076
tends to eat its own quite a bit.

4346
03:37:25,076 --> 03:37:25,909
- [Lex] Yeah.

4347
03:37:25,909 --> 03:37:29,414
- Like it tends to be very self-critical.

4348
03:37:29,415 --> 03:37:33,808
And instead of saying, well,
Elon is more supportive

4349
03:37:33,808 --> 03:37:38,805
of Bitcoin than the other
10,000 people in the world,

4350
03:37:38,805 --> 03:37:41,036
with serious amounts
of money, they're like,

4351
03:37:41,036 --> 03:37:43,050
they focus upon, you know?

4352
03:37:43,050 --> 03:37:44,787
- Yeah, this is strange.

4353
03:37:44,788 --> 03:37:46,525
Eating your own is just-

4354
03:37:46,525 --> 03:37:49,522
- So, I mean, I think he's
free to do what he wants to do.

4355
03:37:49,522 --> 03:37:53,393
And I think he's done a
lot of good for Bitcoin

4356
03:37:53,393 --> 03:37:56,718
in putting it on the balance
sheet of Tesla and holding it.

4357
03:37:56,718 --> 03:38:00,584
And I think that sent a
very powerful message.

4358
03:38:00,584 --> 03:38:02,840
- Do you have advice for young people?

4359
03:38:02,841 --> 03:38:06,202
So, you've had a heck of a life.

4360
03:38:06,202 --> 03:38:09,626
You've done quite a lot
of things before MIT,

4361
03:38:09,626 --> 03:38:11,908
but starting with MIT.

4362
03:38:11,908 --> 03:38:13,594
Is there advice you have for young people

4363
03:38:13,594 --> 03:38:15,592
in high school and college,

4364
03:38:15,593 --> 03:38:19,093
how to have a career they can be proud of,

4365
03:38:21,606 --> 03:38:24,389
how to have a life they can be proud of?

4366
03:38:24,389 --> 03:38:28,628
- I was asked by somebody for quick advice

4367
03:38:28,629 --> 03:38:31,962
for his young children, he had twins,

4368
03:38:31,961 --> 03:38:34,476
when they enter adulthood.

4369
03:38:34,477 --> 03:38:38,144
He said, "Give me your
advice for them in a letter.

4370
03:38:38,144 --> 03:38:42,977
I'm gonna give it to them when
they turn 21 or something."

4371
03:38:43,933 --> 03:38:45,897
I was at a party and then he handed me

4372
03:38:45,897 --> 03:38:46,924
this sheet of paper and I thought,

4373
03:38:46,924 --> 03:38:48,842
"Oh, he wants me to
write it down right now."

4374
03:38:48,842 --> 03:38:50,845
So I sat down, I started
writing and I figured,

4375
03:38:50,844 --> 03:38:54,380
"Well, what would you want
to tell someone at age 21?"

4376
03:38:54,380 --> 03:38:55,465
- You wrote it down?

4377
03:38:55,465 --> 03:38:56,298
- [Michael] So I wrote it down.

4378
03:38:56,298 --> 03:38:57,131
- Awesome.

4379
03:38:57,130 --> 03:38:58,208
Then I tweeted it and
it's sitting on Twitter.

4380
03:38:58,209 --> 03:38:59,364
But I tell you what I said.

4381
03:38:59,363 --> 03:39:02,727
I said my advice if
you're entering adulthood.

4382
03:39:02,727 --> 03:39:05,644
Focus your energy, guard your time,

4383
03:39:08,431 --> 03:39:12,847
train your mind, train your
body, think for yourself,

4384
03:39:16,851 --> 03:39:20,601
curate your friends,
curate your environment,

4385
03:39:23,130 --> 03:39:25,880
keep your promises, stay cheerful

4386
03:39:27,087 --> 03:39:30,421
and constructive, and upgrade the world.

4387
03:39:31,565 --> 03:39:32,873
Like that was the 10.

4388
03:39:32,872 --> 03:39:33,752
- Upgrade the world.

4389
03:39:33,752 --> 03:39:36,162
That's an interesting choice of words.

4390
03:39:36,162 --> 03:39:39,245
Upgrade the world, upgrade the world.

4391
03:39:40,239 --> 03:39:41,255
- [Michael] It's like an engineering-

4392
03:39:41,255 --> 03:39:42,406
- Focus your energy.

4393
03:39:42,406 --> 03:39:45,573
Yeah, it is a very engineering themed.

4394
03:39:47,093 --> 03:39:49,640
Keep your promises too.

4395
03:39:49,639 --> 03:39:51,064
That's an interesting one.

4396
03:39:51,064 --> 03:39:55,564
- I think most people suffer
because they don't focus.

4397
03:39:56,772 --> 03:39:57,917
Like you gotta figure out,

4398
03:39:57,916 --> 03:39:59,700
I think the big risk in this world

4399
03:39:59,700 --> 03:40:01,626
is there's too much of everything.

4400
03:40:01,627 --> 03:40:02,518
- [Lex] Yeah.

4401
03:40:02,518 --> 03:40:04,320
- Like you can sit and watch chess videos

4402
03:40:04,320 --> 03:40:06,897
a hundred hours a week and
you'll never get through

4403
03:40:06,897 --> 03:40:09,295
all the chess videos, right?

4404
03:40:09,295 --> 03:40:13,497
There's too much of every possible thing,

4405
03:40:13,497 --> 03:40:15,179
too much of every good thing.

4406
03:40:15,179 --> 03:40:17,929
So figuring out what you wanna do

4407
03:40:18,859 --> 03:40:22,224
and then everything will
suck up your time, right?

4408
03:40:22,224 --> 03:40:24,926
There's a hundred streaming
channels to binge watch on.

4409
03:40:24,926 --> 03:40:28,670
So you gotta guard your time
and then train your body,

4410
03:40:28,670 --> 03:40:33,103
train your mind, and
control who's around you,

4411
03:40:33,102 --> 03:40:35,352
control what surrounds you.

4412
03:40:36,525 --> 03:40:38,914
So ultimately in a world
where there's too much

4413
03:40:38,914 --> 03:40:41,664
of everything, then your success-

4414
03:40:42,994 --> 03:40:44,381
- It's like those laser eyes.

4415
03:40:44,380 --> 03:40:48,130
It's like those laser
eyes, you have to focus

4416
03:40:49,183 --> 03:40:51,848
on just a few of those things.

4417
03:40:51,847 --> 03:40:54,472
- Yeah, I mean, I got a thousand opinions

4418
03:40:54,472 --> 03:40:57,003
we could talk about and I
could pursue a thousand things,

4419
03:40:57,003 --> 03:40:58,475
but I don't expect to be successful.

4420
03:40:58,475 --> 03:41:02,641
And I'm not sure that my
opinion in any of the 999

4421
03:41:03,604 --> 03:41:08,604
is any more valid than the
leader of thought in that area,

4422
03:41:09,202 --> 03:41:12,786
so how about if I just
focus upon one thing

4423
03:41:14,074 --> 03:41:18,090
and then deliver the best
I can in the one thing.

4424
03:41:18,090 --> 03:41:21,105
That's the laser eye message.

4425
03:41:21,105 --> 03:41:23,130
The rest get you distracted.

4426
03:41:23,130 --> 03:41:24,282
- How do you achieve that?

4427
03:41:24,282 --> 03:41:26,716
Do you find yourself given
where you are in life

4428
03:41:26,717 --> 03:41:31,134
having to say no a lot or
just fo focus comes natural

4429
03:41:32,166 --> 03:41:34,421
when you just ignore
everything around you?

4430
03:41:34,421 --> 03:41:37,274
So how do you achieve that focus?

4431
03:41:37,274 --> 03:41:39,574
- I think it helps if people
know what you're focused on.

4432
03:41:39,575 --> 03:41:40,709
(Lex chuckles)

4433
03:41:40,709 --> 03:41:43,775
- So everything about you just
radiates that, people know.

4434
03:41:43,775 --> 03:41:44,963
People know this is-

4435
03:41:44,963 --> 03:41:46,375
- Right, if they know
what you're focused on,

4436
03:41:46,375 --> 03:41:51,041
then you won't get so many
other things coming your way.

4437
03:41:52,460 --> 03:41:56,960
If you dally or if you flirt
with 27 different things,

4438
03:41:59,608 --> 03:42:01,686
then you're gonna get approached by people

4439
03:42:01,686 --> 03:42:04,221
in each of the 27 communities, right?

4440
03:42:04,221 --> 03:42:06,976
- You mentioned at beginning a PhD

4441
03:42:06,977 --> 03:42:09,766
and given your roots at MIT,

4442
03:42:09,765 --> 03:42:12,927
do you think there's all kinds of journeys

4443
03:42:12,927 --> 03:42:15,121
you can take to educate yourself?

4444
03:42:15,121 --> 03:42:19,038
Do you think a PhD or
school is still worth it?

4445
03:42:20,781 --> 03:42:23,985
Or is there other paths through life that-

4446
03:42:23,986 --> 03:42:25,454
- Is it worth it if you had to pay for it?

4447
03:42:25,454 --> 03:42:27,822
Is it worth it if you
to spend the time on it?

4448
03:42:27,822 --> 03:42:31,072
- The time and the money is a big cost.

4449
03:42:32,683 --> 03:42:35,067
Time probably the bigger one, right?

4450
03:42:35,066 --> 03:42:37,179
- It seems clear to me that the world

4451
03:42:37,180 --> 03:42:39,096
wants more specialists.

4452
03:42:41,128 --> 03:42:46,128
It wants you to be an expert
in and to focus on in one area,

4453
03:42:47,718 --> 03:42:51,885
and it's punishing generalist,
jack of all trades,

4454
03:42:52,818 --> 03:42:54,876
especially people that are generalists

4455
03:42:54,876 --> 03:42:57,199
in the physical realm,
'cause if you're a specialist

4456
03:42:57,199 --> 03:42:59,292
in the digital realm, you might very well,

4457
03:42:59,292 --> 03:43:03,916
you're the person with
700,000 followers on Twitter

4458
03:43:03,916 --> 03:43:06,490
and you show them how to tie knots

4459
03:43:06,490 --> 03:43:10,865
or you're the banjo player
with 1.8 million followers,

4460
03:43:10,865 --> 03:43:14,304
and when everybody types
banjo, it's you, right?

4461
03:43:14,304 --> 03:43:15,137
- [Lex] Yeah.

4462
03:43:15,137 --> 03:43:19,956
- And so the world wants
people that do something well,

4463
03:43:19,956 --> 03:43:24,706
and then it wants to stamp
out 18 million copies of them.

4464
03:43:26,834 --> 03:43:28,983
And so that argues in favor of focus.

4465
03:43:28,984 --> 03:43:32,373
Now, I mean, the definition
of a PhD is someone

4466
03:43:32,373 --> 03:43:34,896
with enough of an education
that they're capable of

4467
03:43:34,897 --> 03:43:37,341
or have made, I guess to get a PhD,

4468
03:43:37,341 --> 03:43:41,188
technically you have to
have done a dissertation

4469
03:43:41,188 --> 03:43:43,609
where you made a seminal contribution

4470
03:43:43,609 --> 03:43:46,184
to the body of human knowledge, right?

4471
03:43:46,184 --> 03:43:47,381
And if you haven't done that,

4472
03:43:47,381 --> 03:43:49,590
technically you have a master's degree,

4473
03:43:49,590 --> 03:43:51,592
but you're not a doctor.

4474
03:43:51,592 --> 03:43:56,319
So if you're interested in any
of the academic disciplines

4475
03:43:56,318 --> 03:43:59,501
that a PhD would be granted for,

4476
03:43:59,501 --> 03:44:02,736
then I can see that being
a reasonable pursuit.

4477
03:44:02,736 --> 03:44:06,506
But there are many people
that are specialists.

4478
03:44:06,505 --> 03:44:08,582
You know the Agadmator?

4479
03:44:08,583 --> 03:44:10,489
- Yeah, yeah.
- The Agadmator on YouTube.

4480
03:44:10,489 --> 03:44:11,530
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4481
03:44:11,531 --> 03:44:14,496
- He's the world's
greatest chess commentator.

4482
03:44:14,495 --> 03:44:15,342
- [Lex] Yeah. (chuckles)

4483
03:44:15,343 --> 03:44:16,643
- And I've watched his career

4484
03:44:16,643 --> 03:44:18,000
and he is got progressively better.

4485
03:44:18,000 --> 03:44:19,271
And he is really good.

4486
03:44:19,271 --> 03:44:21,302
- He's gonna love hearing this. (chuckles)

4487
03:44:21,302 --> 03:44:23,000
- Yeah, if the Agadmator overhears this,

4488
03:44:23,000 --> 03:44:24,268
I'm a big fan of the Agadmator,

4489
03:44:24,268 --> 03:44:26,371
unfortunately, I have to
cut myself off, right,

4490
03:44:26,371 --> 03:44:27,531
because otherwise you'll watch

4491
03:44:27,531 --> 03:44:31,211
the entire Paul Morphy
saga for your weekend.

4492
03:44:31,211 --> 03:44:35,153
But the point really is
YouTube is full of experts

4493
03:44:35,154 --> 03:44:37,895
who are specialists in something,

4494
03:44:37,895 --> 03:44:40,742
and they rise to the
top of their profession.

4495
03:44:40,742 --> 03:44:44,075
And Twitter is too, and the internet is.

4496
03:44:45,956 --> 03:44:49,206
So I would advocate that you figure out

4497
03:44:50,602 --> 03:44:55,297
what you're passionate about
and what you're good at,

4498
03:44:55,298 --> 03:44:59,963
and you do focus on it,
especially if the thing

4499
03:44:59,963 --> 03:45:03,333
that you're doing can be automated.

4500
03:45:03,333 --> 03:45:05,717
The problem is back to that

4501
03:45:05,717 --> 03:45:09,140
500,000 algebra teacher type comment.

4502
03:45:09,139 --> 03:45:12,385
The problem is if it is
possible to be automated,

4503
03:45:12,386 --> 03:45:16,636
then over time someone's
probably gonna automate it

4504
03:45:17,903 --> 03:45:22,236
and that squeezes the state
space of everybody else.

4505
03:45:23,204 --> 03:45:26,496
It's like after the
lockdowns, it used to be there

4506
03:45:26,496 --> 03:45:30,311
are like all these local
bands that played in bars,

4507
03:45:30,311 --> 03:45:32,774
and everybody went to the
bar to see the local band.

4508
03:45:32,774 --> 03:45:34,179
And then during the lockdown

4509
03:45:34,179 --> 03:45:37,308
you would have like these six super groups

4510
03:45:37,308 --> 03:45:40,914
and they would all get
500,000 or a million followers

4511
03:45:40,915 --> 03:45:43,228
and all these smaller local bands

4512
03:45:43,227 --> 03:45:45,644
just got no attention at all.

4513
03:45:48,390 --> 03:45:49,645
- Well, the interesting thing is,

4514
03:45:49,645 --> 03:45:51,934
one of those 500,000 algebra teachers

4515
03:45:51,933 --> 03:45:54,865
is likely to be part of the automation,

4516
03:45:54,865 --> 03:45:56,838
so it's like it's an
opportunity for you to think,

4517
03:45:56,838 --> 03:46:00,672
where's my field, my
discipline evolving into.

4518
03:46:03,281 --> 03:46:04,822
I talked to a bunch of librarians,

4519
03:46:04,823 --> 03:46:08,128
just happen to be friends with librarians

4520
03:46:08,128 --> 03:46:11,260
and libraries will probably be evolving.

4521
03:46:11,260 --> 03:46:12,781
And it's up to you as
a librarian to be one

4522
03:46:12,781 --> 03:46:15,864
of the few that remain in the rubble.

4523
03:46:17,995 --> 03:46:21,208
- If you're gonna give
commentary on Shakespeare plays,

4524
03:46:21,208 --> 03:46:24,042
I want you to basically do it
for every Shakespeare play.

4525
03:46:24,042 --> 03:46:27,066
Like, I want you to be
the Shakespeare dude.

4526
03:46:27,066 --> 03:46:29,316
Just like Lex, you're like-

4527
03:46:30,361 --> 03:46:32,218
- I don't know what kind of. (chuckles)

4528
03:46:32,218 --> 03:46:35,865
- You are the deep
thinking podcaster, right?

4529
03:46:35,865 --> 03:46:38,387
Or you're the podcaster that goes

4530
03:46:38,387 --> 03:46:41,887
after the deep intellectual conversations.

4531
03:46:44,252 --> 03:46:47,485
And once I get comfortable
with you and I like you,

4532
03:46:47,485 --> 03:46:49,411
then I start binge watching Lex.

4533
03:46:49,411 --> 03:46:50,367
- [Lex] Yeah.

4534
03:46:50,367 --> 03:46:53,819
- But if you changed your format

4535
03:46:53,819 --> 03:46:56,556
through 16 different formats,
so that you could compete

4536
03:46:56,557 --> 03:46:59,983
with 16 different other
personalities on YouTube,

4537
03:46:59,983 --> 03:47:03,405
you'd probably wouldn't
beat any of 'em, right?

4538
03:47:03,405 --> 03:47:05,229
You would probably just
kind of sink into the,

4539
03:47:05,228 --> 03:47:07,606
you're the number two or number three guy.

4540
03:47:07,606 --> 03:47:10,730
You're not the number
one guy in the format.

4541
03:47:10,730 --> 03:47:13,480
And I think the algorithm, right?

4542
03:47:14,721 --> 03:47:17,307
The Twitter algorithm and
the YouTube algorithms,

4543
03:47:17,308 --> 03:47:18,955
they really reward the person

4544
03:47:18,954 --> 03:47:22,886
that's focused on message, consistent.

4545
03:47:22,886 --> 03:47:24,875
The world wants somebody they can trust

4546
03:47:24,875 --> 03:47:27,386
that's consistent and reliable

4547
03:47:27,386 --> 03:47:29,896
and they kind of want to know
what they're getting into

4548
03:47:29,896 --> 03:47:33,621
because and this is
taken for granted maybe,

4549
03:47:33,620 --> 03:47:36,037
but there's 10 million people

4550
03:47:37,318 --> 03:47:40,379
vying for every hour of your time,

4551
03:47:40,379 --> 03:47:44,361
and so the fact that anybody
gives you any time at all

4552
03:47:44,361 --> 03:47:46,516
is a huge privilege, right?
- [Lex] Is amazing.

4553
03:47:46,516 --> 03:47:48,561
- And you should be thanking them.

4554
03:47:48,561 --> 03:47:51,011
And you should respect their time.

4555
03:47:51,011 --> 03:47:52,778
- It's interesting,
like everything you said

4556
03:47:52,778 --> 03:47:53,921
is very interesting.

4557
03:47:53,921 --> 03:47:55,301
But of course, from my perspective

4558
03:47:55,301 --> 03:47:57,627
and probably from your perspective,

4559
03:47:57,628 --> 03:48:00,263
my actual life has nothing to do with,

4560
03:48:00,263 --> 03:48:02,415
it's just being focused on stuff.

4561
03:48:02,415 --> 03:48:03,951
And in my case, it's like focused

4562
03:48:03,950 --> 03:48:08,617
on doing the thing I really
enjoy doing and being myself

4563
03:48:10,290 --> 03:48:11,795
and not caring about anything else.

4564
03:48:11,795 --> 03:48:15,761
Like I don't care about
views or likes or attention.

4565
03:48:15,761 --> 03:48:17,745
And that just maintaining that focus

4566
03:48:17,745 --> 03:48:19,419
is the way from an individual perspective,

4567
03:48:19,418 --> 03:48:21,418
you live that life.

4568
03:48:21,418 --> 03:48:24,899
But yeah, it does seem
that there's the world

4569
03:48:24,899 --> 03:48:28,363
and technology is rewarding
the specialization

4570
03:48:28,363 --> 03:48:29,890
and creating bigger and bigger platforms

4571
03:48:29,890 --> 03:48:32,724
for the different specializations.

4572
03:48:33,701 --> 03:48:35,703
Yeah, and then that
lifts all boats actually,

4573
03:48:35,703 --> 03:48:37,824
'cause the specializations
get better and better

4574
03:48:37,825 --> 03:48:40,652
and better at teaching
people to do specific things

4575
03:48:40,652 --> 03:48:43,691
and they educate themselves and
it just, everybody gets more

4576
03:48:43,691 --> 03:48:46,893
and more knowledgeable and
more and more empowered.

4577
03:48:46,893 --> 03:48:50,308
- The reward for authenticity
more than offsets

4578
03:48:50,308 --> 03:48:54,390
the specificity with which
you pursue your mission.

4579
03:48:54,390 --> 03:48:55,378
- [Lex] That's true, yeah.

4580
03:48:55,379 --> 03:48:56,759
- Another way to say it is like,

4581
03:48:56,759 --> 03:48:59,209
nobody wants to read advertising.

4582
03:48:59,209 --> 03:49:00,841
Like if you were to spend

4583
03:49:00,841 --> 03:49:04,615
a hundred million dollars
advertising your thing,

4584
03:49:04,615 --> 03:49:06,653
I probably wouldn't wanna watch it.

4585
03:49:06,653 --> 03:49:09,335
- Yeah, that's so fascinating.

4586
03:49:09,334 --> 03:49:10,325
Yeah, so fascinating.

4587
03:49:10,325 --> 03:49:11,550
- [Michael] We see the death of that.

4588
03:49:11,550 --> 03:49:12,384
- Yeah.

4589
03:49:12,384 --> 03:49:16,128
- And so the commercial shows
are losing their audiences

4590
03:49:16,128 --> 03:49:20,628
and the authentic specialists
or the authentic artists

4591
03:49:21,921 --> 03:49:24,171
are gaining their audience.

4592
03:49:25,072 --> 03:49:26,888
- And that's a beautiful thing.

4593
03:49:26,888 --> 03:49:31,149
Speaking of deep thinking,
you're just a human,

4594
03:49:31,148 --> 03:49:35,315
your life ends, you've
accumulated so much wisdom,

4595
03:49:36,179 --> 03:49:38,925
so much money, but the ride ends.

4596
03:49:38,925 --> 03:49:39,861
Do you think about that?

4597
03:49:39,861 --> 03:49:43,594
Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

4598
03:49:43,594 --> 03:49:45,344
Are you afraid of it?

4599
03:49:47,174 --> 03:49:51,477
- When I go all my assets
will flow into a foundation,

4600
03:49:51,477 --> 03:49:52,609
and the foundation's mission

4601
03:49:52,610 --> 03:49:56,103
is to make education free
for everybody forever.

4602
03:49:56,102 --> 03:49:59,852
And if I'm able to
contribute to the creation

4603
03:50:02,573 --> 03:50:05,797
of a more perfect monetary system,

4604
03:50:05,797 --> 03:50:09,565
then maybe that foundation
will go on forever, right?

4605
03:50:09,565 --> 03:50:13,043
- (chuckles) The idea, the
foundation of the idea,

4606
03:50:13,043 --> 03:50:17,539
so not just the, it's
each of the foundations.

4607
03:50:17,539 --> 03:50:20,373
- It's not clear we're on the
S-curve of a mortal life yet.

4608
03:50:20,373 --> 03:50:22,369
Like that's a biological question.

4609
03:50:22,369 --> 03:50:26,664
And you asked that on some of
your other interviews a lot.

4610
03:50:26,664 --> 03:50:31,664
I think that we are on the
threshold of immortal life

4611
03:50:31,808 --> 03:50:34,597
for ideas or immortal life

4612
03:50:34,597 --> 03:50:38,454
for certain institutions
or computer programs.

4613
03:50:38,454 --> 03:50:40,938
So if we can fix the money,

4614
03:50:40,938 --> 03:50:45,925
then you can create a
technically perfected endowment.

4615
03:50:45,925 --> 03:50:49,537
And then the question really
is what are your ideas?

4616
03:50:49,538 --> 03:50:51,377
What do you want to leave behind?

4617
03:50:51,377 --> 03:50:54,802
And so if it's a park, then
you endow the park, right?

4618
03:50:54,802 --> 03:50:57,333
If it's free education, you endow that.

4619
03:50:57,333 --> 03:51:00,583
If it's some other ethical idea, right?

4620
03:51:02,750 --> 03:51:06,291
- Does it make you sad
that there's something

4621
03:51:06,291 --> 03:51:09,875
that you've endowed
some very powerful idea

4622
03:51:11,524 --> 03:51:15,774
of digital energy that you
help put into the world,

4623
03:51:17,891 --> 03:51:21,539
and then your mind, your conscious mind

4624
03:51:21,540 --> 03:51:25,733
will no longer be there to experience it.

4625
03:51:25,733 --> 03:51:27,736
It's just gone forever.

4626
03:51:27,736 --> 03:51:32,295
- I'd rather think that the
thing that Satoshi taught us

4627
03:51:32,295 --> 03:51:36,637
is you should do your part
during some phase of the journey,

4628
03:51:36,637 --> 03:51:38,184
and then you should get out of the way.

4629
03:51:38,183 --> 03:51:39,974
- [Lex] (chuckles) Yeah.

4630
03:51:39,975 --> 03:51:43,388
- I think Steve Jobs
said something similar

4631
03:51:43,388 --> 03:51:47,291
to that effect in a very,
very famous speech one day,

4632
03:51:47,290 --> 03:51:50,313
which is, "Death is a natural part of life

4633
03:51:50,314 --> 03:51:53,754
and it makes way for the next generation."

4634
03:51:53,754 --> 03:51:58,197
And I think the goal is you
upgrade the world, right?

4635
03:51:58,197 --> 03:52:02,198
You leave it a better place,
but you get out of the way.

4636
03:52:02,198 --> 03:52:06,614
And I think when that breaks
down, bad things happen.

4637
03:52:10,851 --> 03:52:12,563
I think nature cleanses itself.

4638
03:52:12,563 --> 03:52:14,563
There's a cycle of life.

4639
03:52:15,397 --> 03:52:17,873
- And speaking one of great people

4640
03:52:17,872 --> 03:52:20,001
who did also get outta the
way is George Washington.

4641
03:52:20,001 --> 03:52:22,207
So hopefully when you get outta the way

4642
03:52:22,207 --> 03:52:27,040
and nobody's bleeding you to
death in hope of helping you.

4643
03:52:30,745 --> 03:52:32,604
To do a bit of a callback.

4644
03:52:32,603 --> 03:52:35,434
What do you think is the
meaning of this whole thing?

4645
03:52:35,434 --> 03:52:36,657
What's the meaning of life?

4646
03:52:36,657 --> 03:52:37,814
Why are we here?

4647
03:52:37,815 --> 03:52:40,460
We talked about the rise
of human civilization.

4648
03:52:40,459 --> 03:52:42,856
It seems like we're engineers at heart.

4649
03:52:42,856 --> 03:52:47,421
We build cool stuff, better
and better use of energy,

4650
03:52:47,421 --> 03:52:50,076
channeling energy to be productive.

4651
03:52:50,075 --> 03:52:51,353
Why?

4652
03:52:51,353 --> 03:52:53,639
What's it all for?

4653
03:52:53,639 --> 03:52:57,815
- (chuckles) You're
getting metaphysical on me.

4654
03:52:57,816 --> 03:52:59,924
- Very, there's a beautiful
boat to the left of us.

4655
03:52:59,924 --> 03:53:01,095
Like why do we do that?

4656
03:53:01,094 --> 03:53:05,701
This boat that sailed the ocean,
then we build models of it

4657
03:53:05,701 --> 03:53:09,049
to celebrate great
engineering of the past.

4658
03:53:09,049 --> 03:53:11,049
- To engineer is divine.

4659
03:53:13,081 --> 03:53:15,129
You can make lots of
arguments as why we're here.

4660
03:53:15,129 --> 03:53:16,854
We're either here to entertain ourself

4661
03:53:16,853 --> 03:53:20,931
or we're here to create
something that's beautiful

4662
03:53:20,932 --> 03:53:22,823
or something that's functional.

4663
03:53:22,823 --> 03:53:24,420
I think if you're an engineer,
you entertain yourself

4664
03:53:24,420 --> 03:53:28,083
by creating something that's
both beautiful and functional.

4665
03:53:28,083 --> 03:53:29,688
So I think all three of those things,

4666
03:53:29,688 --> 03:53:32,688
it's entertaining, but it's ethical.

4667
03:53:33,530 --> 03:53:38,530
You gotta admire the first
person that built a bridge,

4668
03:53:38,618 --> 03:53:42,299
crossing a chasm or the first
person to work out the problem

4669
03:53:42,299 --> 03:53:46,000
of how to get running water to a village

4670
03:53:46,000 --> 03:53:47,770
or the first person to figure out

4671
03:53:47,770 --> 03:53:51,520
how to dam up a river
or mastered agriculture

4672
03:53:54,004 --> 03:53:57,588
or the guy that figured out
how to grow fruit on trees

4673
03:53:57,587 --> 03:53:59,638
or created orchards, and maybe one day

4674
03:53:59,638 --> 03:54:01,331
he had like 10 fruit trees.

4675
03:54:01,332 --> 03:54:04,096
He is pretty proud of himself.

4676
03:54:04,096 --> 03:54:06,128
- So, that's functional.

4677
03:54:06,128 --> 03:54:07,603
There is also something to that,

4678
03:54:07,602 --> 03:54:10,377
just like you said, that's just beautiful.

4679
03:54:10,378 --> 03:54:12,545
It does get you closer to,

4680
03:54:13,859 --> 03:54:16,859
like you said, the divine something.

4681
03:54:18,965 --> 03:54:23,286
When you step back and
look at the entirety of it,

4682
03:54:23,286 --> 03:54:28,198
a collective of humans
using a beautiful invention

4683
03:54:28,198 --> 03:54:32,448
or creation or just something
about this instrument

4684
03:54:33,791 --> 03:54:37,041
is creating a beautiful piece of music.

4685
03:54:38,986 --> 03:54:40,707
That seems just right.

4686
03:54:40,707 --> 03:54:42,272
That's what we're here for.

4687
03:54:42,272 --> 03:54:44,990
Whatever the divine is, it
seems like we're here for that.

4688
03:54:44,989 --> 03:54:46,908
And I of course love talking to you

4689
03:54:46,908 --> 03:54:49,227
because from the engineering perspective,

4690
03:54:49,227 --> 03:54:50,630
the functional is ultimately

4691
03:54:50,630 --> 03:54:54,120
the mechanism towards the beauty.

4692
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:55,326
- Isn't there something beautiful about

4693
03:54:55,326 --> 03:54:58,773
making the world a better
place for people that you love?

4694
03:54:58,773 --> 03:54:59,606
- [Lex] Yeah.

4695
03:54:59,606 --> 03:55:02,962
- Your friends, your family, or yourself.

4696
03:55:02,962 --> 03:55:04,546
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah.

4697
03:55:05,914 --> 03:55:10,914
- And when you think about the
entire arc of human existence

4698
03:55:12,577 --> 03:55:15,150
and you roll the clock back 500,000 years

4699
03:55:15,150 --> 03:55:16,709
and you think about every struggle

4700
03:55:16,709 --> 03:55:19,285
of everyone that came before us

4701
03:55:19,286 --> 03:55:21,278
and everything they had to overcome

4702
03:55:21,278 --> 03:55:25,259
in order to put you here
right now, you know,

4703
03:55:25,259 --> 03:55:28,662
you kind of, you gotta admire that, right?

4704
03:55:28,662 --> 03:55:30,470
You gotta respect that.

4705
03:55:30,469 --> 03:55:32,478
- That's a heck of a gift they gave us.

4706
03:55:32,478 --> 03:55:35,561
It's also a heck of a responsibility.

4707
03:55:36,859 --> 03:55:39,872
Don't screw it up. (chuckles)

4708
03:55:39,872 --> 03:55:41,935
- If I dropped you 500,000 years ago

4709
03:55:41,935 --> 03:55:44,563
and I said, figure out steel refining,

4710
03:55:44,563 --> 03:55:48,146
or figure out silicon
chips, fab production

4711
03:55:50,993 --> 03:55:54,422
or whatever it is or fire?
- Why?

4712
03:55:54,422 --> 03:55:57,702
- And so now we're here and I
guess the way you repay them

4713
03:55:57,701 --> 03:56:01,886
is you fix everything in front
of your face you can, right?

4714
03:56:01,887 --> 03:56:04,887
And that means to someone like Elon,

4715
03:56:05,888 --> 03:56:09,247
it means get us off the planet, right?

4716
03:56:09,247 --> 03:56:11,038
To someone like me, it's like,

4717
03:56:11,038 --> 03:56:14,204
I think fix the energy and the system.

4718
03:56:15,325 --> 03:56:16,777
- And that gives me hope.

4719
03:56:16,778 --> 03:56:18,388
Michael, this was an
incredible conversation.

4720
03:56:18,388 --> 03:56:19,731
You're an incredible human.

4721
03:56:19,731 --> 03:56:22,310
It's a huge honor you
would sit down with me.

4722
03:56:22,310 --> 03:56:24,370
Thank you so much for talking today.

4723
03:56:24,370 --> 03:56:26,451
- Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex.

4724
03:56:26,451 --> 03:56:27,760
- Thanks for listening
to this conversation

4725
03:56:27,761 --> 03:56:29,192
with Michael Saylor.

4726
03:56:29,191 --> 03:56:30,340

And now let me leave you

4729
03:56:34,402 --> 03:56:37,813
with a few words from Francis Bacon.

4730
03:56:37,813 --> 03:56:41,563
"Money is a great servant,
but a bad master."

4731
03:56:43,375 --> 03:56:47,875
Thank you for listening and
hope to see you next time.
