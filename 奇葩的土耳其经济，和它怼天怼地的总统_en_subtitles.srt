1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:00,500
 

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,032
 

3
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,432
What comes to mind

4
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,332
when you think of Türkiye

5
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,432
tourist attraction

6
00:00:05,432 --> 00:00:06,432
Ottoman Empire

7
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:07,833
Turkey

8
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:08,932
or Salt Bae

9
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:10,665
Let me tell you this

10
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,033
the strangest thing about Türkiye

11
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,099
is their economy

12
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,065
In 2022

13
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:17,166
Türkiye's inflation rate 

14
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,266
suddenly began to soar above 80%

15
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:21,098
Value of Turkish lira dropped by half in a year

16
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,200
Sounds very bad

17
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,899
But in 2022

18
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,999
Their GDP growth was at 5.6%

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,832
The entire stock market increased by three folds

20
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,065
Moreover, their President

21
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:31,298
has been dissing on interest rate non-stop

22
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,733
saying interest rate is evil

23
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,632
We need to believe in one true God

24
00:00:37,066 --> 00:00:37,766
A big country

25
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:39,332
of 85 million people

26
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,832
Its GDP ranks among the world's top 20

27
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,632
Going against mainstream economics

28
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:43,499
Trump even said he will

29
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,798
destroy Türkiye’s economy

30
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,099
but he is unequivocal and put on tough stand

31
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,865
What are all this about？

32
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,333
Let’s get into it with Lin

33
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:51,598
and discover the eccentricity

34
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,265
of Turkish Economy

35
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,765
Let's start with a very quick background

36
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,365
on the Turkish economy

37
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:00,865
In the early days

38
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,232
Türkiye had been relatively closed

39
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,000
they were just doing their own thing

40
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:04,899
However after WWII

41
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,100
Looking at Europe in the north, huddled together for warmth

42
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:08,265
The development was in full swing

43
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:09,465
Turkey wanted to join too

44
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:10,965
and had applied many times

45
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:12,132
to join the predecessor of EU

46
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,033
They even opened their country wide

47
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:14,865
to allow western capitalists

48
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:16,132
to invest in Türkiye

49
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,766
but they opened up too fast too wide

50
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,666
ended up owing huge amount of debt

51
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:21,933
The only solution then was

52
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,933
to keep printing money

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,299
and exchange it into USD to pay off the debt

54
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:25,799
Moreover in the 80s

55
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,132
the two oil crises

56
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,098
had kept inflation high in Türkiye

57
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:31,132
It had reached more than 120% several times

58
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,365
With just few short sentences

59
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:36,165
we’ve already pointed 

60
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:37,899
to two main problems

61
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,099
in Turkish economy

62
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,965
external debt and inflation

63
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,365
The Turkish government realised that

64
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:45,899
NO

65
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,132
we can’t go down like this

66
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,600
else the gap between us and the EU

67
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,165
will grow wider

68
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:51,099
So from 1999

69
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,965
Türkiye firmly caried out

70
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:54,232
a series of reforms

71
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,666
One of the most important task

72
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,465
was to completely separate 

73
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:58,165
central bank from the government

74
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:58,599
 This is

75
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,865
of absolute important

76
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:00,599
in contemporary economy bodies

77
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:01,798
This is because the power of

78
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,533
central bank is too big

79
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,299
where they could print money and control interest rate

80
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:04,799
Imagine

81
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,332
if the government make all the decisions

82
00:02:06,332 --> 00:02:07,198
It could lead to

83
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,966
the bank becoming government’s

84
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:09,533
personal money printing machine

85
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,232
Even if the government is very determined

86
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,500
but the market was still worried

87
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,032
so they wouldn’t dare to

88
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:15,532
invest or trade

89
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,599
The Turkish government 

90
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,599
had to no matter what

91
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,432
separate from the central bank

92
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:20,265
Once become independent

93
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,733
if the government were to issue debt

94
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,533
it has to follow the supply and demand of the market.

95
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,532
If the market feels that your default risk

96
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:27,332
or future inflation expectations are high

97
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:28,799
the price of government bonds

98
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
will be lowered

99
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:30,599
This invisibly

100
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,765
put great pressure on the government

101
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:32,932
The government has to control

102
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:33,599
national finance 

103
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,265
as well as inflation

104
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,699
For the next few years, the Turkish government

105
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
started to cut expenditures

106
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:41,632
and pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio

107
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:43,332
down to 30%

108
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:43,932
You have to know that

109
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,532
it is considered to be healthy

110
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,365
if the ratio is below 50%

111
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,666
Let’s not look at the crazy ones

112
00:02:48,665 --> 00:02:49,799
like USA and Japan

113
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,733
Even the very restrained German government

114
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,332
has almost never gone down below 60%

115
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,399
So you can imagine

116
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,366
this 30% is very

117
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:56,433
impressive for Türkiye

118
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:58,165
They also liberalized financial controls

119
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,066
let the lira float to adjust to supply and demand

120
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,399
To curb high inflation

121
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,466
they even increase the 

122
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,033
interest rate to 100%

123
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,466
Türkiye completely changed

124
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,632
turned over new leaf

125
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,099
and trying to be a better nation

126
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,033
So what’s the result?

127
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:13,632
It crashed

128
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,733
The Turkish lira has lost more than

129
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,966
half its value in eight months

130
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,199
This was not that bad

131
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,466
This is only a brief period of pain

132
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,699
after the exchange rate liberalization

133
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,466
Turkish Lira did crash for awhile

134
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:24,233
but managed to be controlled

135
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,765
Inflation was being pressed down

136
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:26,399
very rapidly

137
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:28,699
That's 100% interest rate

138
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,899
It’s not just inflation

139
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,098
anything that would inflate will be pressed down

140
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,432
Before this Turkish Lira 

141
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:35,032
depreciated too much

142
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,332
had to spend thousands of lira

143
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,633
just for a meal

144
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:38,665
 it had disrupted

145
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:40,432
normal operation of the economy

146
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:41,399
Therefore in 2005

147
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,432
Türkiye

148
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,733
introduced a new lira

149
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,432
 New Turkish Lira

150
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,132
A meal that cost a million lira before

151
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,366
now is just

152
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,533
about 10 lira

153
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,366
With the new currency

154
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,866
it marks that Türkiye had

155
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,500
manage to transform itself completely

156
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,599
and ready for the new spring

157
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,165
A large influx of external investment

158
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:00,733
boosted the Turkish economy

159
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,200
From 2001 until 2016

160
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,366
except slightly impacted during 

161
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,533
the financial crisis period

162
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:06,500
the GDP growth 

163
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,199
was kept at 5% to 12%

164
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,366
With the inflation being

165
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,699
pressed down so low

166
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,199
Turkey's heavy industry, textile industry

167
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,466
agriculture, etc. are all rising rapidly

168
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,633
Exports have increased sixfold in eight years

169
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,066
Tourism has grown even more

170
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,298
In 2019, it became

171
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,800
the sixth most visited country in the world

172
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,165
It brings more than $30 billion 

173
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,466
in revenue to Türkiye every year

174
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,733
However

175
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,533
behind the Turkish spring

176
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,466
there are two major problems

177
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,500
One is account deficit

178
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,798
or trade deficit

179
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,799
Imports consistently outnumber exports

180
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,300
Meaning the goods that you buy 

181
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,033
is consistently more than the goods that you sell

182
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,300
Türkiye is already 

183
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,133
one of the countries that’s

184
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:46,932
with the most deficit in the world

185
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,500
So you have to keep spending money right

186
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,298
and you need USD or Euro to import

187
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:51,233
now the problem comes

188
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:51,899
Where would Türkiye get

189
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,432
so much USD or Euro

190
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:54,733
to support trade deficit?

191
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,999
This happened to lead to the second problem

192
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,766
external debt

193
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:00,932
We mentioned earlier that

194
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,665
As government debt continues to fall

195
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,233
private debt continues to rise

196
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,132
in contrast to government debt

197
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,565
Actually the increase in personal loans

198
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:08,598
is not a bad thing

199
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400
It is what modern economies would like to see

200
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,365
Because borrowing money means

201
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:12,699
your investment needs

202
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,932
and consumption needs is robust

203
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,966
But Türkiye is borrowing from external source

204
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:17,598
that is Euro, GBP, USD

205
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,533
it’s not lira

206
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,400
In other word, you can’t print the money

207
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:22,465
At that time Türkiye

208
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,598
wanted to join EU

209
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,266
so they opened up their country

210
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,833
It was very easy 

211
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,366
for their citizens to get foreign loan

212
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:29,065
For Turkish entrepreneurs

213
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,598
inflation and interest rate is very low

214
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,233
for Euro and USD

215
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:33,566
so they were very inclined

216
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:34,399
to take up foreign loan

217
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,598
By 2019

218
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,133
within Turkish citizens’ savings

219
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:38,598
50% of them is in

220
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,866
foreign currency

221
00:05:39,865 --> 00:05:41,099
Can you imagine

222
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,266
that for half of the country, the money saved is not in lira

223
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,199
A new noun created for this

224
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,098
Dollarization

225
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,199
 the word Dollar in here

226
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,665
refers to all foreign currency

227
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:50,899
The problem is easy to understand

228
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,132
It’s not a very bad thing

229
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,432
for the citizens of a country

230
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:54,565
to get foreign loan extensively

231
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,866
 but when they couldn’t pay

232
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:56,599
that’s where the trouble comes

233
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
that affect the country

234
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,665
The trouble came

235
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:03,832
in 2014

236
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,800
Türkiye had a new president

237
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,365
key figures in Türkiye

238
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,565
his name is Recep Tayyip Erdogan

239
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:13,033
Actually from 2003

240
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,333
he was already the Prime Minister

241
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,499
The prosperity of Türkiye 

242
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,633
has a lot to do with him

243
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:19,198
so he was very popular back then

244
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,699
Once he became President

245
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,365
he took Türkiye on a

246
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,632
very eccentric path

247
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:25,265
very eccentric path

248
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:28,298
Although before

249
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,833
Türkiye was growing very fast and very well

250
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,300
but because

251
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,699
of its severe trade deficit

252
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,499
the market 

253
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,100
was worried about dollar shortage

254
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,199
similar to last year’s Sri Lanka

255
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,133
causing Turkish lira to fall

256
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,698
Later Türkiye bought a few

257
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:42,733
fighter jets from Russia

258
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,066
Türkiye is a NATO member

259
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,498
the act of buying fighter jets from Russia

260
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,433
pissed off USA

261
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:50,165
Trump started attacking him

262
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,600
and said

263
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,133
if you don’t control yourself

264
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:53,799
 I’ll destroy

265
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,865
Turkish economy

266
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,132
I’m not embellishing the story

267
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,833
this comes from his Twitter

268
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:58,966
He also imposed punitive tariffs

269
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,266
on Turkish raw materials

270
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,966
Erdogan is ruthless yet talkative

271
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:03,066
and he isn’t scared of Trump

272
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:03,865
He even go around 

273
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,432
the country to give speech passionately

274
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,466
Just ignore the USA,  they have dollars

275
00:07:07,466 --> 00:07:08,699
We have the people

276
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,665
We have God

277
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:10,899
We have Allah

278
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:15,866
Sounds inspiring right

279
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,199
regardless, market was freaked out

280
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,165
They were already worried

281
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:20,266
of the dollar shortage in Türkiye

282
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,699
and now the fight with USA

283
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:22,733
Due to this situation

284
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,466
international capital all fled away

285
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,466
From 2018 till 2019

286
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,999
nearly half of foreign capital withdrew from the market

287
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,033
Turkish Lira almost collapse

288
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,366
Don’t forget we mentioned earlier that

289
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:33,332
Turkish citizens borrowed a lot of foreign loan

290
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,633
if foreign capital withdraw overnight

291
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,466
then the capital chain for both

292
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,199
personal and companies might be broken

293
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,333
With the rapid depreciation of the lira

294
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,866
The inflation that has been gone

295
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,165
for almost 10 years in Turkey

296
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,466
 is making a comeback

297
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:49,499
In the face of crisis, the Turkish central bank

298
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,199
did a standard procedure very decisively

299
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:51,799
and that is increase interest rate

300
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,566
Higher interest rates can curb inflation

301
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,132
drag down the local exchange rate

302
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:55,599
This is a good thing

303
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,066
I’ve talked about this extensively in the inflation episode

304
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,233
With this, the inflation in Türkiye

305
00:07:58,266 --> 00:07:59,699
managed to be pressed down

306
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,299
However President Erdogan

307
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,865
came out and said

308
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,798
no we should not increase interest rate

309
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,600
we should decrease it

310
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,966
interest rate is mother and father all evils

311
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,132
mother and father of all evils

312
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,266
What economists say in other countries around the world

313
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,165
is bullshit and wrong

314
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,865
Only by cutting interest rates can curb inflation

315
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,033
You must be wondering what is he thinking

316
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,333
If he wasn’t crazy

317
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,766
We’ll analyse this later

318
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,866
Anyhow, Erdogan

319
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,432
forcefully urged the central bank to cut interest rates

320
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,632
The governor of central bank is an economist after all

321
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,032
Mr President this is ridiculous

322
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,566
how can we cut interest rate during high inflation

323
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,232
didn’t you watch Lin’s video?

324
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,133
We said earlier that

325
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,500
the government separated

326
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,533
the central bank from the government

327
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,566
 Technically

328
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:37,932
they don’t have to listen to Erdogan

329
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:38,566
 However

330
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,533
Erdogan was well prepared

331
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,566
In 2017

332
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:42,365
he amended the constitution

333
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,798
so that he could possess

334
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,765
the right to appoint central bankers

335
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,633
So are you going to cut the rate?

336
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:50,432
No? Alright

337
00:08:50,432 --> 00:08:51,732
Your day as governor is over

338
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,732
he removed the governor of the central bank

339
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:54,632
 

340
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:55,932
And replaced with someone who would listen to him

341
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:56,298
 

342
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:57,098
Immediate interest cut

343
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,432
Imagine

344
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,466
when the market see such a weird President

345
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,765
they got even more panic and withdraw from the market

346
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:02,065
Lira dropped again

347
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:02,966
The new governor

348
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,500
upon seeing the condition of Lira

349
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,265
started to increase the rate again

350
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:06,665
but he was sacked

351
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,099
The new governor

352
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,566
had to increase the interest rate a few days later

353
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,833
and got sacked again

354
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:11,332
Just like this

355
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,332
three governors of Turkish Central Bank

356
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,865
was sacked in the period of 2 years

357
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,832
The new governor is simple

358
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,332
you want it cut, then we’ll cut the rates

359
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,298
This means that

360
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:23,165
an independent central bank system

361
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,433
that was built before

362
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:25,599
was broken by Erdogan

363
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,266
Even the former Prime Minister

364
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,999
Erdogan's former number two person

365
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,765
openly said that

366
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,098
Erdogan doesn’t understand economy

367
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,799
the people around him also don’t understand economy

368
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,632
He is like from another planet

369
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,133
See

370
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:36,432
even the criticism sound civilized

371
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,500
So now let’s see

372
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,399
what exactly is in the mind of

373
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,332
President Erdogan

374
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:41,566
 Of course I couldn’t possibly now

375
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,166
his exact thoughts

376
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:43,766
I could only base it from

377
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:44,998
some of his speeches, interviews

378
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,133
or public information

379
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,365
to understand

380
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,633
He actually has a

381
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:51,199
perfect logic chain

382
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
Aren't you all going to talk about economics?

383
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:52,732
Alright

384
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:54,332
Let me tell you my economics

385
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,165
By cutting interest rate, we can drive

386
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,666
demand and investment growth

387
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,366
When demand and investment grow

388
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,899
it could drive the increase of commodity

389
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,633
If the increase in the supply of a commodity

390
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,133
is higher than the increase in demand

391
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,733
won't the price drop?

392
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,165
This not only could curb inflation

393
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,265
 and can keep growth

394
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,232
Actually what he said 

395
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,832
you can’t say it’s not making sense

396
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:13,432
It’s just that from past experience

397
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:15,066
the negative impact of low interest rate

398
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:15,865
is often bigger than

399
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,298
the positive impact that he mentioned

400
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:18,865
Low interest rates can cause the economy to overheat

401
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,332
the effect of increased demand will be more  distinct

402
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,966
which will cause higher inflation rate

403
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,399
You might be a bit confuse now

404
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,966
Let me give you an example

405
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,298
it’s not necessarily a good metaphor

406
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:27,999
This is like 

407
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
 a car that is moving very fast

408
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,333
and you want it to stop

409
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,100
people would normally think to pull it

410
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,165
but for Erdogan

411
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,499
he said no you shouldn’t pull it

412
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,332
you should push it

413
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,298
because when you push it

414
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:37,298
it’ll move faster

415
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:38,399
and it’ll create a bigger

416
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,365
air resistance and friction

417
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:40,265
when these two forces is 

418
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,533
bigger than the thrust

419
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,832
the speed will slow down

420
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:43,932
So if you want it to slow down

421
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,466
you shouldn’t pull it, you should push it instead

422
00:10:46,298 --> 00:10:47,399
Of course economics

423
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,932
is definitely not as absolute as physics

424
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:49,798
Let me make an example

425
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:51,566
so you can feel it 

426
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
After listening to this

427
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,466
you must think

428
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,932
this man must have no common sense

429
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:56,133
Actually in the economy world

430
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,699
that’s how people view him

431
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,333
According to Erdogan’s theory

432
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,265
you cut the rate when the economy is overheated

433
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:02,832
you also cut the rate to stimulate economy 

434
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:03,732
 

435
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,500
This is Erdogan’s target

436
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,298
No matter how bad the inflation

437
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,098
I’m going to lower the interest rate to 0

438
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,233
Then why must he

439
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,765
lower the interest rate down to zero?

440
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,566
This is because of his religious belief

441
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:19,133
Türkiye is an Islamic nation

442
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,899
And the teachings of Islam emphasize that

443
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:22,332
interest rate is bad

444
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:24,065
you shouldn’t use money to make profit

445
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,365
That’s why Erdogan said

446
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,665
interest rate is the father and mother of all evils

447
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:27,966
Due to this teaching

448
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,365
It’s very difficult for the 

449
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,165
banking industry in Türkiye

450
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,533
Whatever they do is not justified properly

451
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,865
have to figure out various ways

452
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:34,432
to go around this evil interest rate

453
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,033
If you were

454
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,033
to buy a house in Türkiye via loan

455
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,966
then the bank can’t charge you interest

456
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,166
They have to buy this house

457
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,399
and sell it to you at a higher price

458
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,798
and loan it to you with zero interest

459
00:11:43,798 --> 00:11:45,765
or they rent the house to you

460
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:47,765
Well they can adjust the rental 

461
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:49,298
Anyway they think of everything they could

462
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:50,598
to get around interest rate

463
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:51,499
From here you can see that

464
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,633
the Turkish is very much against

465
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:53,533
interest rate

466
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:54,332
Back to the story

467
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,033
Erdogan wanted to cut the interest rate

468
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,700
What is the result

469
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,533
of his unconventional operation?

470
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,932
Erdogan was unfortunate

471
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:03,865
got caught up with the 2022 energy crisis

472
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:04,665
That has left Türkiye

473
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,033
a big energy importer

474
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:06,899
reeling

475
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:07,332
You see

476
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:08,732
This is the inflation rate of Türkiye

477
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:09,500
in half year

478
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,798
from 20% surge up to 80%

479
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,466
And this is official data

480
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,832
According to private estimation

481
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,265
this number should be about

482
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,832
100% to 200%

483
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,798
Foreign capital fled in panic again

484
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,732
The lira halved in yet another year

485
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,732
Turkish citizens if they have

486
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,466
money in hand that can be exchanged into foreign currency

487
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:25,133
they did it quickly

488
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,332
If they don’t then it’ll be worthless

489
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,232
because the deposit interest rate is very low

490
00:12:28,232 --> 00:12:29,699
and inflation is high

491
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,633
With money on hand, people started to spend it

492
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,399
by stocking up goods, buy houses, stocks

493
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,233
In 2022

494
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:38,732
Türkiye's domestic consumption is booming

495
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,365
The stock market is the best in the world

496
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:41,015
See

497
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:42,182
every other country has fallen so hard

498
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,065
meanwhile Türkiye’s figure is 300%

499
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
Strong consumption and investment

500
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,100
indeed drives

501
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,033
very strong GDP

502
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,832
in 2021 and 2022

503
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:51,332
Even if the global economy is weak

504
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,832
Even if the energy crisis hits hard

505
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:53,533
In 2022

506
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,699
Türkiye manage to keep

507
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,833
growth of 5.6%

508
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,633
Consumption is good

509
00:12:58,832 --> 00:13:00,399
Stock market is doing well, GDP is growing as well

510
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,232
Everything is going well

511
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,599
So what Erdogan said was right

512
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,365
Interest rate cuts really boost consumption

513
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:05,732
It drives investment and exports

514
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,000
These are right

515
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,399
but it’s only one façade of the economy

516
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:10,899
If you ask Turkish citizens

517
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,099
Few people will tell you

518
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,133
they feel richer

519
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,365
or feel happier 

520
00:13:14,365 --> 00:13:14,966
This prosperity

521
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,232
can only be counted as

522
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:17,065
False prosperity

523
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:17,500
Actually everyone

524
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,932
was in panic spending mode

525
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,298
or panic buying stocks mode

526
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,098
They spend and invest

527
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,266
not because of their confidence in future

528
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:24,500
Although GDP goes up

529
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,533
but everyone is anxious

530
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,000
This prosperity won’t last long

531
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:29,499
One more thing

532
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,533
the richer families and companies in Türkiye

533
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,899
could indeed exchange their money to foreign currency

534
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,798
or invest their money to avoid inflation

535
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,232
But it’s not the case for lower income group

536
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,765
They could only watch their money

537
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:38,466
getting less day-by-day

538
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:39,600
The rate of salary increase

539
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,365
could not keep up with inflation hike

540
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,365
which caused wider gap between rich and poor

541
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,298
More than half of Turkish are actually

542
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,632
getting paid the lowest salary

543
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,533
Look here

544
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,365
This is a demographic chart of Turkey

545
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,533
Under 45 years old.. abundant of them

546
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,365
What an ideal 

547
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,066
demographic structure for these aging countries

548
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,066
to look at

549
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,333
With Erdogan making such a kerfuffle

550
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,199
Every year, 300,000 young people

551
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,500
are lost to other countries

552
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,299
That's 300,000

553
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:04,066
highly educated young people

554
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,733
Statistics from a German company show that

555
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,832
In Türkiye, 73% of young people

556
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,232
want to leave the country

557
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:11,532
This loss of talent and confidence

558
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,065
will have a bigger

559
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,033
long-term impact on Türkiye

560
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:18,500
In the face of widespread complaints about inflation

561
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,899
Erdogan

562
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,499
didn’t just sit and do nothing

563
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,166
Other than cutting interest rate

564
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,899
the overall strategy is actually quite clear

565
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,332
He knows that

566
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,865
Now Türkiye's biggest problem

567
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,832
is capital outflow

568
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:28,133
If he doesn’t take any measures

569
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,299
the Turkish citizens are going to exchange their currency 

570
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:29,999
then it’ll be bad news

571
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,566
Moreover for him personally 

572
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,333
the most important for him is Presidential election

573
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,000
in this coming June 2023

574
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,666
This is related to whether

575
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,733
he can continue to be re-elected.

576
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,066
So Erdogan did two things

577
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,133
The first measure is to prevent capital outflows

578
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,598
 As an incentive for people to switch back to Lira

579
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,265
Other than taking measure

580
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:47,632
like limiting banks' foreign exchange holdings

581
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,466
They even

582
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,766
came out with a very creative

583
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,165
protected foreign exchange deposit model

584
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:55,665
What does it mean?

585
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,266
For those holding USD

586
00:14:57,432 --> 00:14:59,332
if you exchange USD to Lira

587
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,966
Even after the exchange rate you lose money

588
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,100
Take the collapse of the lira

589
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,566
The bank will pay you back what you lost

590
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:04,266
In other words

591
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:06,432
The bank is taking on the exchange rate risk for you

592
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,165
Sounds creative and innovative 

593
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,533
Erdogan’s second move is

594
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,533
bring in foreign capital

595
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
or draw foreign allies

596
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,100
Actually the inflation was

597
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,266
so high last year in Türkiye

598
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:19,232
including the constant trade deficit

599
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,265
the main reason

600
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:20,798
is because it is

601
00:15:20,798 --> 00:15:22,298
huge energy importer

602
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:23,899
Türkiye is quite unlucky

603
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:24,966
the geographical area

604
00:15:25,232 --> 00:15:27,699
at north there’s Russia, at south there’s Middle East

605
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,333
All producer of fossil fuels

606
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:30,600
But Türkiye

607
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,766
doesn’t really have fossil fuels

608
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,566
90% of their energy has to be imported

609
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,500
This time Erdogan

610
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
realised the importance of energy

611
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,633
He changed his bold and brazen personality

612
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,932
and started to create

613
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:40,533
good relations with these energy powerhouse

614
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:44,533
Although Türkiye is part of NATO

615
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,265
but Erdogan is against sanction on Russia

616
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,098
He even actively trade with Russia

617
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,200
After Russia-Ukraine war

618
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,466
the trade between Türkiye and Russia

619
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,566
increased compared to before war

620
00:15:51,566 --> 00:15:53,066
He even managed to get

621
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,266
$9.1 billion

622
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,533
to build their own nuclear power plant

623
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,699
Apart from that, Erdogan

624
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,466
is cuddling up with UAE

625
00:15:58,466 --> 00:15:58,966
FYI

626
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,332
In 2016, Erdogan

627
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:01,199
went through

628
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,500
a very big military coup

629
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,499
And the big benefactor behind this coup

630
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,200
is UAE

631
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,765
So Erdogan and UAE

632
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,998
they didn’t get along

633
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,966
This time, he forget the past

634
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:10,865
and signed a

635
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,865
$4.9 billion currency swap agreement

636
00:16:12,865 --> 00:16:14,466
Another is President of Egypt Abdel Fattah al-Sisi

637
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,000
Before this

638
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,865
Erdogan claimed that he is a murderer

639
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:17,365
that he is barbaric

640
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:18,633
This time taking advantage of World Cup

641
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,766
they held hand

642
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:21,665
Apart from that, Türkiye got a loan

643
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,433
from their old friend Qatar

644
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,966
of about $10 billion

645
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:25,633
They got $5 billion from Saudi

646
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,733
In just a year

647
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:27,099
Erdogan 

648
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,798
has become friends with

649
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:29,698
countries he once despised

650
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,666
He also draws in tens of billions of dollars in investment

651
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,266
And you see

652
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:33,865
these countries are energy powerhouse

653
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,298
They have to rely

654
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:35,899
on these new friends

655
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,533
for energy import

656
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,333
I can only say there’s no eternal enemy

657
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,533
only perpetual benefits

658
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,633
In February 6th 2023

659
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,466
Türkiye suffered two consecutive earthquakes

660
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:48,365
with a magnitude of 7.8

661
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:50,033
At least 45,000 people were killed

662
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:50,933
Turkish government

663
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,698
need to spend at least $80 billion

664
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,233
to repair the damage

665
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:54,966
This will have a huge impact

666
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,699
on public confidence

667
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,199
government debt and inflation

668
00:16:58,432 --> 00:16:58,865
As for President Erdogan

669
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:00,533
will he be able to curb inflation

670
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,733
or will Türkiye become Venezuela

671
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:02,699
or Argentina

672
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,766
Will Erdogan be re-elected

673
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:05,598
 I 

674
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,365
do not know

675
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,565
Only time will tell
