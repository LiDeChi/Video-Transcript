1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,109
- The following is a conversation
with Elon Musk, DJ Seo,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,950
Matthew MacDougall, Bliss
Chapman, and Nolan Arbaugh

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,730
about Neuralink and
the future of humanity.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,030
Elon, DJ, Matthew and
Bliss are of course part

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:17,039
of the amazing Neuralink team,

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,049
and Noland is the first human

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,900
to have a Neuralink device
implanted in his brain.

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,759
I speak with each of them individually,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,950
so use timestamps to jump around,

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,820
or as I recommend, go hardcore

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,800
and listen to the whole thing.

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,160
This is the longest
podcast I've ever done.

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,019
It's a fascinating, super technical,

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,880
and wide-ranging conversation,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,649
and I loved every minute of it.

16
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,090
And now, dear friends, here's Elon Musk,

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,950
his fifth time on this,
"The Lex Fridman Podcast."

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,480
- Drinking coffee or water?

19
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,312
- Water.

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,070
I'm so over-caffeinated right now.

21
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,299
Do you want some caffeine?

22
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,309
- I mean, sure.

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,383
- There's a Nitro drink.

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,920
- This supposed to keep you up till like

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,939
tomorrow afternoon basically. (laughs)

26
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,049
- Yeah.

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,162
I don't have any-
- So what is Nitro?

28
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:13,439
It's just got a lot of
caffeine or something?

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,272
- Don't ask questions.

30
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,152
It's called Nitro.

31
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,909
- Do you need to know anything else?

32
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,759
- It's got nitrogen, that's ridiculous.

33
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,193
I mean, what we breathe
is 78% nitrogen anyway.

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,742
What do you need to add more for? (laughs)

35
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,396
- [Speaker] Unfortunately,
you're gonna need it.

36
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,079
- Most people think that
they're breathing oxygen,

37
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,780
and they're actually
breathing 78% nitrogen.

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,748
You need like a milk bar.
- Milk bar.

39
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,859
(Elon laughing)

40
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,674
- Like from Clockwork Orange. (laughs)

41
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:41,643
- Yeah, yeah.

42
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:44,519
Is that top three Kubrick film for you?

43
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,412
- Clockwork Orange, it's pretty good.

44
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:46,982
I mean, it's demented.

45
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,353
Jarring, I'd say.

46
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,477
- (laughs) Okay.

47
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,689
Okay, so first let's step back

48
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,269
and big congrats on getting Neuralink

49
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,369
implanted into a human.

50
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,106
That's a historic step for Neuralink.

51
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:05,938
- Oh, thanks, yeah.

52
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,259
- There's many more to come.

53
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,430
- Yeah, and we just, obviously,
our second implant as well.

54
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,510
- [Lex] How did that go?

55
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:13,409
- So far, so good.

56
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,143
Looks like we've got,

57
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,062
I think over 400 electrodes
that are providing signals.

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,313
So yeah.
- Nice.

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,400
How quickly do you think the number

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,409
of human participants will scale?

61
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,710
- It depends on the regulatory approval,

62
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,439
the rate which we get
regulatory approvals.

63
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,879
So we're hoping to do 10
by the end of this year.

64
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,923
Total of 10, so eight more.

65
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,580
- And with each one,
you're gonna be learning

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,450
a lot of lessons about the
new biology, the brain,

67
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,579
everything, the whole
chain of the Neuralink,

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,219
the decoding, the signal
processing, all that kind of stuff.

69
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,560
- Yeah, yeah, I think it's
obviously gonna get better

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,582
with each one.

71
00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,282
I mean, I don't wanna jinx it,

72
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:02,279
but it seems to have gone extremely well

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,960
with the second implant,
so there's a lot of signal,

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,849
a lot of electrodes.

75
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:09,840
It's working very well.

76
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,700
- What improvements do you think we'll see

77
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,239
in Neuralink in the coming, let's say,

78
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,460
let's get crazy, the coming years?

79
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,883
- I mean, in years,
it's gonna be gigantic,

80
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,310
because we'll increase the number

81
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,112
of electrodes dramatically.

82
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,652
We'll improve the signal processing.

83
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,610
Even with only roughly,
I don't know, 10, 15%

84
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,570
of the electrodes working with Noland,

85
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,060
with our first patient,

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,409
we were able to get to
achieve a bit per second.

87
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:44,909
That's twice the world record.

88
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,810
So I think we'll start
like vastly exceeding

89
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,750
world record by orders of
magnitude in the years to come.

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,143
So it's start getting to, I don't know,

91
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,893
a hundred bits per second thousand.

92
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,912
Maybe if like five years from
now, we might be at a megabit,

93
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,379
like faster than any human
could possibly communicate

94
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,389
by typing or speaking.

95
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,199
- Yeah, that BPS is an
interesting metric to measure.

96
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,959
There might be a big leap

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,410
in the experience once you
reach a certain level of BPS.

98
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,580
- [Elon] Yeah.

99
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,500
- Like entire new ways of interacting

100
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,060
with a computer might be unlocked.

101
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,589
- And with humans.

102
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:23,669
- With other humans.

103
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,170
- Provided they have (laughs),

104
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,569
they want a Neuralink too.

105
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,529
- Right.

106
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,029
- Otherwise, they won't be able to absorb

107
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:31,319
the signals fast enough.

108
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,790
- Do you think they'll improve the quality

109
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,410
of intellectual discourse?

110
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,020
- Well, I think you could think of it,

111
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:41,819
if you were to slow down communication,

112
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,949
how do you feel about that?

113
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,389
If you'd only talk at, let's say,

114
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,187
1/10th of normal speed, you'd be like,

115
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,129
"Wow, that's agonizingly slow."

116
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,240
- [Lex] Yeah.

117
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,703
- So now, imagine you could speak,

118
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,360
communicate clearly at 10 or 100

119
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,900
or 1,000 times faster than normal.

120
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,549
- Listen, I'm pretty sure
nobody in their right mind

121
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,081
listens to me at 1x, they listen at 2x.

122
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:09,449
(Elon laughs)

123
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,269
I can only imagine what
10x would feel like

124
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,039
or could actually understand it.

125
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,140
- I usually default to 1.5x.

126
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,932
You can do 2x, but well, actually,

127
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,939
if I'm listening to somebody

128
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,399
in like sort of 15, 20 minutes
segments to go to sleep,

129
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,449
then I'll do it 1.5x.

130
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,293
If I'm paying attention,
I'll do 2x. (laughs)

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,112
- Right.

132
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:35,219
- But actually, if you start
actually listen to podcasts

133
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,683
or sort of audio books or anything,

134
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,425
if you get used to doing it at 1.5,

135
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,470
then one sounds painfully slow.

136
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,930
- I'm still holding onto
one because I'm afraid.

137
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm afraid of myself becoming
bored with the reality,

138
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,132
with the real world where
everyone's speaking on 1x.

139
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,729
(both laughing)

140
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,660
- Well, depends on the person.

141
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,530
You can speak very fast.

142
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,969
Like we can communicate very quickly.

143
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,160
And also, if you use a wide range of,

144
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,939
if your vocabulary is
larger, your bit rate,

145
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,389
effective bit rate is higher.

146
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,329
- That's a good way to put it.

147
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,305
- Yeah.
- The effective bit rate.

148
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,310
I mean, that is the question
is how much information

149
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,449
is actually compressed in the
low bit transfer of language.

150
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,543
- Yeah.

151
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,280
If there's a single word
that is able to convey

152
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,079
something that would normally require,

153
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,060
I don't know, 10 simple words,

154
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,932
then you've got maybe a 10x
compression on your hands.

155
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,170
And that's really, like with memes,

156
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,943
memes are like data compression.

157
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,003
It conveys a whole,

158
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:39,300
you're simultaneously
hit with a wide range

159
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,610
of symbols that you can interpret.

160
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,610
And you kinda get it faster
than if it were words

161
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,319
or a simple picture.

162
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,569
- And of course, you're
referring to memes broadly

163
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,490
like ideas.
- Yeah.

164
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,280
There's an entire idea structure

165
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,669
that is like an idea template,

166
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,463
and then you can add something
to that idea template.

167
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,310
But somebody has that preexisting

168
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,259
idea template in their head.

169
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,180
So when you add that
incremental bit of information,

170
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,220
you're conveying much more than a few,

171
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,170
just set a few words.

172
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,270
It's everything associated with that meme.

173
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,399
- You think there'll be
emergent leaps of capability

174
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,079
as you scale the number of electrodes?

175
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,879
Like there'll be a certain,

176
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,730
you think there'll be like
actual number where it just,

177
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,280
the human experience will be altered?

178
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,779
- Yes.

179
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,789
- What do you think that number might be,

180
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,460
whether electrodes or BPS?

181
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,750
We of course don't know for sure,

182
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,990
but is this 10,000, 100,000?

183
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,670
- Yeah, I mean certainly,
if you're anywhere

184
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,460
at 10,000 bits per second,
I mean, that's vastly faster

185
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,649
than any human could
communicate right now.

186
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:45,779
If you think about what is the average

187
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,039
bits per second of a human?

188
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,740
It is less than one bit per
second over the course of a day,

189
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,526
because there are 86,400 seconds in a day.

190
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:56,942
And you don't communicate
86,400 tokens in a day.

191
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,139
Therefore, your bits per
second is less than one,

192
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,759
averaged over 24 hours.

193
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,019
It's quite slow.

194
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,662
And now, even if you're
communicating very quickly,

195
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,299
and you're talking to
somebody who understands

196
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,509
what you're saying, because
in order to communicate,

197
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:17,459
you have to at least, to some degree,

198
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,519
model the mind state of the
person to whom you're speaking.

199
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,769
Then take the concept
you're trying to convey,

200
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,990
compress that into a
small number of syllables,

201
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,240
speak them, and hope that the other person

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,319
decompresses them into
a conceptual structure

203
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,259
that is as close to what you
have in your mind as possible.

204
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,549
- Yeah, I mean, there's a lot

205
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,169
of signal loss there in that process.

206
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,199
- Yeah, very lousy
compression and decompression.

207
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,100
And a lot of what your neurons are doing

208
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,980
is distilling the concepts down

209
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,789
to a small number of
symbols of, say, syllables

210
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:53,819
that I'm speaking, or keystrokes,
whatever the case may be.

211
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,820
So that's a lot of what your
brain computation is doing.

212
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,940
Now, there is an argument
that that's actually

213
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,819
a healthy thing to do
or a helpful thing to do

214
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,560
because as you try to
compress complex concepts,

215
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,159
you're perhaps forced to distill

216
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:19,259
what is most essential in those concepts

217
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,730
as opposed to just all the fluff.

218
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,009
So in the process of compression,

219
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,259
you distill things down
to what matters the most,

220
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,779
because you can only say a few things.

221
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,639
So that is perhaps helpful.

222
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,870
I think we might, we'll probably get,

223
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,679
if our data rate increases,
it's highly probable

224
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,173
that we'll become far more verbose.

225
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,750
Just like your computer,

226
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,179
when computers had like,

227
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,279
my first computer had 8K of RAM,

228
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,059
so you really thought about every byte.

229
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,000
And now you've got computers

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,309
with many gigabytes of RAM.

231
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:56,192
So if you wanna do an iPhone app

232
00:09:56,192 --> 00:09:58,222
that just says 'Hello world,'

233
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,639
it's probably, I don't know,

234
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,069
several megabytes minimum. (laughs)

235
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,300
A bunch of fluff.

236
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,389
But nonetheless, we still
prefer to have the computer

237
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,852
with more memory and more compute.

238
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,419
So the long-term aspiration of Neuralink

239
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:17,419
is to improve the AI human symbiosis

240
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,819
by increasing the bandwidth
of the communication,

241
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,500
because even in the most
benign scenario of AI,

242
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,850
you have to consider that the
AI is simply gonna get bored

243
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,923
waiting for you to spit out a few words.

244
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,450
I mean, if the AI can communicate
it to terabits per second

245
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,453
and you're communicating
it bits per second,

246
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:44,287
it's like 203.

247
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:47,519
- Well, it is a very interesting question

248
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,549
for a super intelligent species.

249
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,962
What use are humans?

250
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,842
- I think there is some
argument for humans

251
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,850
as a source of will.

252
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,290
- Will?
- Will, yeah.

253
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:02,793
Source of will or purpose.

254
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,750
So if you consider the human
mind as being essentially,

255
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,870
there's the primitive limbic elements,

256
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,840
which basically even like reptiles have,

257
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,070
and there's the cortex,

258
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,040
that's the thinking and
planning part of the brain.

259
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,079
Now, the cortex is much
smarter than the limbic system,

260
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,570
and yet is largely in
service to the limbic system.

261
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,520
It's trying to make the
limbic system happy.

262
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,659
I mean, the sheer amount of compute

263
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,293
that's gone into people
trying to get laid is insane,

264
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,580
without actually seeking procreation.

265
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,450
They're just literally trying to do

266
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:39,993
this sort of simple motion.

267
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,069
(laughs) And they get a kick out of it.

268
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,720
So this simple, which in the
abstract rather absurd motion,

269
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,470
which is sex, the cortex
is putting a massive amount

270
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,410
of compute into trying to
figure out how to do that.

271
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:58,350
- So like 90% of distributed
compute of the human species

272
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,970
is spent on trying to get laid, probably,

273
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,160
like a massive amount.
- Large percent, yeah, yeah.

274
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:06,779
There's no purpose to most
sex except hedonistic.

275
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,970
It's just sort of joy or whatever.

276
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,413
Dopamine release.

277
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:14,399
Now, once in a while, it's procreation,

278
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,242
but for humans, modern humans,
it's mostly recreational.

279
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,720
So your cortex, much smarter
than your limbic system,

280
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,552
is trying to make the limbic system happy

281
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,547
'cause the limbic system
wants to have sex,

282
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:31,799
or want some tasty food or
whatever the case may be.

283
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,629
And then that is then further augmented

284
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:37,139
by the tertiary system, which
is your phone, your laptop,

285
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,269
iPad, whatever, or your computing stuff.

286
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:40,860
That's your tertiary layer.

287
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,620
So you're actually already a cyborg.

288
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,179
You have this tertiary compute layer,

289
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,309
which is in the form of your computer

290
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:50,072
with all the applications
or your compute devices.

291
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:55,409
And so in the getting laid front,

292
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:59,279
there's actually a massive
amount of digital compute

293
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,279
also trying to get laid, with
like Tinder and whatever.

294
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,122
- Yeah.

295
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:07,259
So the compute that
we've humans have built

296
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,299
is also participating. (laughs)

297
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:11,969
- Yeah, I mean, there's
like gigawatts of compute

298
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,850
going into getting laid,
of digital compute.

299
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,019
- Yeah. (laughs)

300
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:18,322
What if AGI will-
- This is happening

301
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:19,289
as we speak.

302
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,949
- If we merge with AI, it's
just gonna expand the compute

303
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,840
that we humans use-
- Pretty much.

304
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,740
- To try to get laid.
- Well, that's one

305
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,909
of the things, certainly, yeah.

306
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,742
- Yeah.

307
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,620
- But what I'm saying is that yes,

308
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,919
is there a use for humans?

309
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,533
Well, there's this fundamental question

310
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:37,590
of what's the meaning of life?

311
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,740
Why do anything at all?

312
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:44,809
And so if our simple limbic
system provides a source of will

313
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,080
to do something, that
then goes to our cortex,

314
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,370
that then goes to our
tertiary compute layer,

315
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,370
then I don't know, it might
actually be that the AI

316
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,449
in a benign scenario simply trying to make

317
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,552
the human limbic system happy.

318
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,450
- Yeah, it seems like the will is not

319
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,590
just about the limbic system.

320
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,889
There's a lot of interesting,
complicated things in there.

321
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,610
We also want power.

322
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,080
- That's limbic too, I think.

323
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,020
- But then we also want to,
in a kind of cooperative way,

324
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,972
alleviate the suffering in the world.

325
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,332
- Not everybody does, but yeah, sure.

326
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,731
Some people do.

327
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:25,350
- As a group of humans,
when we get together,

328
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,930
we start to have this kind
of collective intelligence

329
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,929
that is more complex in its will

330
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,649
than the underlying individual
descendants of apes, right?

331
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,840
So there's like other motivations.

332
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,660
And that could be a
really interesting source

333
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:45,449
of an objective function for AGI.

334
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,450
- Yeah, I mean, there
are these sort of fairly

335
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:54,899
cerebral or kind of higher level goals.

336
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,117
I mean, for me it's like,

337
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:56,951
what's the meaning of life,

338
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,879
or understanding the
nature of the universe

339
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,192
is of great interest to me.

340
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,560
And hopefully, to AI.

341
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,859
And that's the mission of xAI

342
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,139
and Grok is understand the universe.

343
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,462
- So do you think people,

344
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,043
when you have a Neuralink
with 10,000, 100,000 channels,

345
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,603
most of the use cases will be
communication with AI systems?

346
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:31,802
- Well, assuming there are not,

347
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,326
I mean, they're solving
basic neurological issues

348
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,779
that people have if
they've got damaged neurons

349
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,879
in their spinal cord or neck or, you know,

350
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,269
as is the case with
the first two patients,

351
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,759
then there's obviously,

352
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,889
the first order of business is solving

353
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,309
fundamental neuron
damage in a spinal cord,

354
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:58,502
neck, or in the brain itself.

355
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:05,269
A second product is called Blindsight,

356
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,300
which is to enable people
who are completely blind,

357
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,189
lost both eyes or optic nerve,

358
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,840
or just can't see at all to be able to see

359
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,090
by directly triggering the
neurons in the visual cortex.

360
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,733
So we're just starting at the basics here,

361
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:22,322
so it's like very,

362
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,429
the simple stuff, relatively speaking,

363
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:30,662
is solving neuron damage.

364
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,092
It can also solve I think
probably schizophrenia.

365
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,079
If people have seizures of some kind,

366
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,530
it could probably solve that.

367
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:43,982
It could help with memory.

368
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,082
There's like a kind of a
tech tree, if you will,

369
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,572
of like you got the basics.

370
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:56,976
Like you need literacy before you can have

371
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:57,976
"Lord of the Rings."

372
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:02,100
(both laughing)

373
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,120
- Got it.

374
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,619
- Do you have letters and alphabet?

375
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,149
Okay, great.

376
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,019
Words?

377
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,333
Then eventually get soggy.

378
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,333
So I think there's that
there may be some things

379
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,460
to worry about in the future.

380
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,350
But the first several years

381
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,289
are really just solving
basic neurological damage.

382
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,809
Like for people who have
essentially complete

383
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,039
or near complete loss of,
from the brain to the body.

384
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,740
Like Stephen Hawking would be an example.

385
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,339
The Neuralink would be
incredibly profound,

386
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:36,839
'cause I mean, you can
imagine if Stephen Hawking

387
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,089
could communicate as fast
as we're communicating,

388
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:39,923
perhaps faster.

389
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,173
And that's certainly possible.

390
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,470
Probable, in fact, likely I'd say.

391
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,380
- So there's a kind of dual track

392
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,380
of medical and non-medical, meaning,

393
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,620
so everything you've talked
about could be applied to people

394
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:58,139
who are non-disabled in the future?

395
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,640
- The logical thing to do is,

396
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,800
sensible thing to do
is to start off solving

397
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,480
basic neuron damage issues.

398
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,313
- [Lex] Yes.

399
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:15,000
- 'Cause there's obviously
some risk with a new device.

400
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,190
You can't get the risk down at zero.

401
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,090
It's not possible.

402
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:22,053
So you wanna have the
highest possible reward,

403
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:25,080
given there's a certain irreducible risk.

404
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,319
And if somebody's able to have

405
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:30,752
a profound improvement
in their communication,

406
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,769
that's worth the risk.

407
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,420
- As you get the risk down.

408
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,500
- Yeah, as you get the risk down.

409
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,220
Once the risk is down to, you know,

410
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,587
if you have like thousands of people

411
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,329
that have been using it for years

412
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:48,929
and the risk is minimal,
then perhaps at that point,

413
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,763
you could consider saying,

414
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,069
"Okay, let's aim for augmentation."

415
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:57,029
Now, I think we're actually
gonna aim for augmentation

416
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,129
with people who have neuron damage.

417
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,790
So we're not just aiming to
give people communication

418
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,039
data rate equivalent to normal humans.

419
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,579
We're aiming to give people
who have quadriplegic

420
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,149
or maybe have complete
loss of the connection

421
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,660
to the brain and body, a
communication data rate

422
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,970
that exceeds normal humans,
going, "Well, we're in there.

423
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,803
Why not?

424
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,060
Let's give people superpowers."

425
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,019
- And the same for vision.

426
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,599
As you restore vision,
there could be aspects

427
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,269
of that restoration that are superhuman?

428
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,383
- Yeah, at first, the vision
restoration will be low res,

429
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,293
'cause you have to say like,

430
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,329
"How many neurons can you
put in there and trigger?

431
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:40,319
And you can do things where
you adjust the electric field

432
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,220
to like, even if you've
got, say, 10,000 neurons,

433
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,420
it's not just 10,000 pixels

434
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,950
because you can adjust the
feel between the neurons

435
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,190
and do them in patterns in order to get,

436
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,283
so have, say, 10,000 electrodes
effectively give you,

437
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:01,740
I don't know, maybe
like having a megapixel

438
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,722
or a 10 megapixel situation.

439
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,789
And then over time, I think you get

440
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,549
to higher resolution than human eyes.

441
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,099
And you could also see
in different wavelengths.

442
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,759
So like Geordi La Forge from "Star Trek."

443
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,292
Like the thing.

444
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,534
You wanna see in radar?

445
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:22,493
No problem.

446
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:25,589
You could see ultraviolet, infrared,

447
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,189
eagle vision, whatever you want.

448
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,850
- Do you think there'll be,

449
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,379
let me ask a Joe Rogan question.

450
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,000
Do you think there'll be, (laughs)

451
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,762
I just recently taken ayahuasca.

452
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,490
- Is that a Rogan question?
- No.

453
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,359
Well, yes.
- Well, I guess,

454
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,919
technically it is.

455
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,608
- Yeah.
- Ever tried GMT, bro?

456
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:45,567
(both laughing)

457
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,807
- I love you, Joe.
- Okay.

458
00:20:46,807 --> 00:20:48,412
(laughing continues)

459
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:49,449
- But wait, wait, yeah.

460
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,016
Have you said much about it?

461
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,680
The ayahuasca?
- I've not, I've not.

462
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,872
I've not.
- Okay, well,

463
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:54,859
why are you spilling the beans?

464
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,553
(Lex laughing)

465
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:57,387
It was a truly incredible thing-

466
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:58,690
- Turn the tables on you.

467
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,610
(both laughing)

468
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,459
- Wow, okay.
- You're in the jungle.

469
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:04,328
- [Lex] Yeah, amongst
the trees myself and-

470
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,609
- Yeah, must been crazy.
- And the shaman.

471
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah, with the insects,

472
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,879
with the animals all around you,

473
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,560
like jungle as far as I can see.

474
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,639
There's no-
- I mean-

475
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,899
- That's the way to do it.

476
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,279
- Things are gonna look pretty wild.

477
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,565
- Yeah, pretty wild.

478
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,283
(Elon laughing)

479
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,142
- I think in extremely high dose.

480
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:24,269
- Just don't go hugging an
anaconda or something. (laughs)

481
00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:27,029
- You haven't lived unless
you made love to an anaconda.

482
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm sorry, but-

483
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,827
- Snakes and ladders.

484
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:33,599
(both laughing)

485
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,301
- Yeah, I took a extremely high dose of-

486
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:37,709
- [Elon] Okay. (laughs)

487
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,539
- Nine cups and-
- Damn.

488
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,680
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

489
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,230
Of course, is Noland's one cup or-

490
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,063
- One or two.

491
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,403
Usually, one.

492
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:47,522
- You went, wait.

493
00:21:47,522 --> 00:21:49,978
Like right off the bat, or did
you work your way up to it?

494
00:21:49,979 --> 00:21:52,149
- So I-
(both laughing)

495
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,609
- You're just jumping at the deep end.

496
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,229
- Across two days, 'cause
then the first day,

497
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,156
I took two and I-
- Okay.

498
00:21:57,156 --> 00:21:59,619
- It was a ride, but
it wasn't quite like a-

499
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,409
- It wasn't like revelation.

500
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,269
- It wasn't into deep space type ride.

501
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:05,001
It was just like a little airplane ride.

502
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,839
- [Elon] (laughs) Okay.

503
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,896
- Saw some trees and some
visuals and all that.

504
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,250
I just saw a dragon,
all that kind of stuff.

505
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,589
But-
(laughs)

506
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:14,519
- It's nine cups.

507
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,720
You went to Pluto, I think.

508
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,553
- [Lex] Pluto, yeah.

509
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:17,520
No, deep space.

510
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,720
- Deep space.

511
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,769
- No, one of the interesting
aspects of my experience

512
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:23,339
is I thought I would have some demons,

513
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:24,779
some stuff to work through.

514
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:26,039
- That's what people-

515
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,210
- That's what everyone says.

516
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,184
- That's what everyone says.

517
00:22:28,184 --> 00:22:29,018
Yeah, exactly.
- I had nothing.

518
00:22:29,018 --> 00:22:30,630
I had it all positive.

519
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,400
I just-
- Oh, just pure soul.

520
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,877
- I don't think so, I don't know. (laughs)

521
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,169
But I kept thinking about,

522
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,920
it had like extremely high resolution,

523
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,960
thoughts about the
people I know in my life.

524
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,702
You were there.
- Okay.

525
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,970
- And it's just not from my
relationship with that person,

526
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,069
but just as the person themselves,

527
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,559
I had just this deep
gratitude of who they are.

528
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,389
- That's cool.
- It was just like

529
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,390
this exploration, like Sims or whatever,

530
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,620
you get to watch them.
- Sure.

531
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,879
- I got to watch people

532
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,863
and just be in awe of
how amazing they are.

533
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,930
- That sounds awesome.
- Yeah, it was great.

534
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,517
I was waiting for-
- When's Steven coming?

535
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:07,650
(both laughing)

536
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,483
- Exactly.

537
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:09,869
Maybe I'll have some negative thoughts.

538
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,162
Nothing, nothing.

539
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:15,059
Just extreme gratitude for them.

540
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,537
And then also, a lot of space travel.

541
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:18,569
(both laughing)

542
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,189
- Space travel to where?

543
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,150
- So here's what it was.

544
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,740
It was people, the human
beings that I know,

545
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,240
they had this kinda,

546
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,569
the best way to describe it
is they had a glow to them.

547
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:35,569
And then I kept flying out
from them to see earth,

548
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,839
to see our solar system,
to see our galaxy.

549
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,759
And I saw that light, that
glow all across the universe.

550
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,309
Like whatever that form is.

551
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,769
whatever that like-

552
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,019
- [Elon] Did you go past the Milky Way?

553
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,190
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

554
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,809
You're like intergalactic.

555
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,609
- Yeah, intergalactic.
- Okay, dang.

556
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,589
- But always pointing in-
- Okay.

557
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:01,605
- Yeah, past the Milky way.

558
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,660
I mean, I saw like a
huge number of galaxies,

559
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,900
intergalactic, and all of it was glowing.

560
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,070
But I couldn't control that chill,

561
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:11,309
'cause I would actually
explore near distances

562
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,990
to the solar system, see if there's aliens

563
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,087
or any of that kinda stuff.

564
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,629
I didn't know-
- Is there aliens?

565
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,490
Zero aliens?
- Implication of aliens

566
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,323
because they were glowing.

567
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,133
They were glowing in the same
way that humans were glowing.

568
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:24,809
That like life force that I was seeing,

569
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:27,779
the thing that made humans amazing

570
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,399
was there throughout the universe.

571
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,970
Like there was these glowing dots.

572
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,472
So I don't know.

573
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,049
It made me feel like there is life.

574
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,819
No, not life, but something,

575
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:41,819
whatever makes humans amazing
all throughout the universe.

576
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,679
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, it was amazing.

577
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,690
No demons, no demons.

578
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,890
I looked for the demons.

579
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,730
There's no demons.

580
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,245
There were dragons, and
they're pretty awesome.

581
00:24:49,244 --> 00:24:50,436
So the thing about-

582
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:52,132
- Was there anything scary at all?

583
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,690
- Dragons?

584
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,710
But they weren't scary.

585
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,299
They were friends, they were protective.

586
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,886
So the thing is-
- "Puff, the Magic Dragon."

587
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:02,942
- No, it was more like a "Game
of Thrones" kind of dragons.

588
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:03,779
They weren't very friendly.

589
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:04,613
They were very big.

590
00:25:04,613 --> 00:25:08,130
So the thing is that,
well, giant trees at night,

591
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,450
which is where I was.
- Yeah.

592
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,920
I mean, the jungle's kinda scary.

593
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,470
- Yeah, the trees started
to look like dragons,

594
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,464
and they were all like looking at me.

595
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,119
- Sure, okay.
- And it didn't seem scary.

596
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,319
They seemed like they were protecting me.

597
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,889
And the shaman and the people
didn't speak any English,

598
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,507
by the way, which made it
even scarier I guess. (laughs)

599
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,289
We're not even like, you know,

600
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,093
we're worlds apart in many ways.

601
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:36,990
But yeah, they talk about
the mother of the forest

602
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,967
protecting you, and
that's what I felt like.

603
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:40,350
- And you're way out in the jungle?

604
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,459
- Way out.

605
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,450
This is not like a tourist retreat.

606
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,220
- Like 10 miles outside
of a Rio or something?

607
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,403
- No, we went-

608
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:49,952
(both laughing)

609
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:52,619
No, this is not-
- Deep in the Amazon.

610
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,299
- Me and this guy named Paul Rosolie

611
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,609
who basically is Tarzan.

612
00:25:56,609 --> 00:25:57,839
He lives in the jungle.

613
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,000
We went out deep and we just went crazy.

614
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,680
- Wow, cool.
- Yeah.

615
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
So anyway, can I get that same
experience within Neuralink?

616
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,513
- Probably, yeah.

617
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:09,000
- I guess that is the question
for non-disabled people.

618
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,869
Do you think that there's
a lot in our perception,

619
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:16,529
in our experience of the
world that could be explored,

620
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:18,480
that could be played with using Neuralink?

621
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,549
- Yeah, I mean, Neuralink is,

622
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,839
it's really a generalized
input-output device.

623
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,400
It's reading electrical signals

624
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,410
and generating electrical signals.

625
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,310
And I mean, everything that
you've ever experienced

626
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,119
in your whole life, the smell, emotions,

627
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,250
all of those are electrical signals.

628
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,869
So it's kinda weird to
think that your entire

629
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:47,069
life experience is distilled down

630
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,629
to electrical signals for neurons.

631
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,133
But that is in fact the case.

632
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,800
Or I mean, that's at least

633
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,750
what all the evidence points to.

634
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,750
So I mean, if you
trigger the right neuron,

635
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,729
you could trigger a particular scent.

636
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:06,330
You could certainly make things glow.

637
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:08,669
I mean, do pretty much anything.

638
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,470
I mean, really, you can think of the brain

639
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,029
as a biological computer.

640
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:15,149
So if there are certain,
say, chips or elements

641
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,340
of that biological
computer that are broken,

642
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:20,849
let's say your ability to,
if you've got a stroke,

643
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:21,809
that if you've had a stroke,

644
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,139
that means you got, some part
of your brain is damaged.

645
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,570
If that, let's say,
it's a speech generation

646
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,669
or the ability to move your left hand.

647
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,370
That's the kind of thing
that a Neuralink could solve.

648
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,140
If you've got like a massive amount

649
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,330
of memory loss that's just gone,

650
00:27:39,329 --> 00:27:42,329
well, we can't get the memories back.

651
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,759
We could restore your
ability to make memories,

652
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:49,759
but we can't restore
memories that are fully gone.

653
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:55,849
Now, I should say, maybe if
part of the me memory is there

654
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:00,420
and the means of accessing memory

655
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,400
is the part that's broken,
then we could re-enable

656
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,503
the ability to access the memory.

657
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:08,552
But you can think of it
like RAM in a computer.

658
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,199
If the RAM is destroyed or
your SD card is destroyed,

659
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,250
we can't get that back.

660
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,069
But if the connection to
the SD card is destroyed,

661
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,332
we can fix that.

662
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,090
If it is fixable physically,

663
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:22,829
then yeah, then it can be fixed.

664
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,383
- Of course, with AI, you can just like,

665
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,670
you can repair photographs

666
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,920
and fill in the missing
parts of photographs.

667
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,606
Maybe you can do the same, just like-

668
00:28:30,606 --> 00:28:32,527
- Yeah, you could say like,

669
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:34,470
"Create the most probable set of memories

670
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,470
based on all information
you have about that person."

671
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,313
You could then,

672
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,210
it would be probabilistic
restoration of memory.

673
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,860
Now, we're getting pretty esoteric here.

674
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,500
- But that is one of the
most beautiful aspects

675
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,410
of the human experience is
remembering the good memories.

676
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,050
Like we live most of our life,

677
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:56,970
as Danny Kahneman has talked about,

678
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,519
in our memories, not in the actual moment.

679
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,539
We're collecting memories

680
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,759
and we kind of relive them in our head.

681
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,769
And that's the good times.

682
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:06,960
If you just integrate
over our entire life,

683
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,880
it's remembering the good times

684
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,250
that produces the largest
amount of happiness.

685
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,269
And so-
- Yeah, well, I mean,

686
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:14,039
what are we but our memories?

687
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,772
And what is death but the loss of memory,

688
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,803
loss of information?

689
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,597
If you could say like,
well, if you could be,

690
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,950
you run a thought experiment,

691
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,850
if you were disintegrated painlessly

692
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:32,519
and then reintegrated a moment later,

693
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,200
like teleportation, I guess,

694
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,049
provided there's no information loss,

695
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,930
the fact that your one body was
disintegrated is irrelevant.

696
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,110
- And memories is just
such a huge part of that.

697
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:45,692
- Death is fundamentally
the loss of information,

698
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:47,732
the loss of memory.

699
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,410
- So if we can store them
as accurately as possible,

700
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,140
we basically achieve
a kind of immortality.

701
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,973
- Yeah.

702
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:58,859
- You've talked about

703
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,660
the threats, the safety concerns of AI.

704
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,490
Let's look at long-term visions.

705
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,960
Do you think Neuralink is, in your view,

706
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,590
the best current approach
we have for AI safety?

707
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:15,932
- It's an idea that may
help with AI safety.

708
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:17,663
Certainly not,

709
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,460
I wouldn't wanna claim
it's like some panacea

710
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,083
or that's a sure thing.

711
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,557
But I mean, many years
ago, I was thinking like,

712
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:31,557
"Well, what would inhibit
alignment of collective human will

713
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,539
with artificial intelligence

714
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,420
and the low data rate of humans,

715
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,420
especially our slow output
rate would necessarily just,

716
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:51,599
because the communication is so slow,

717
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:56,599
would diminish the link
between humans and computers?

718
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,735
Like the more you are a tree,

719
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,843
the less you know what a tree is.

720
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:05,610
Like let's say you look at a tree,

721
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:07,026
you look at this plant
or whatever and like,

722
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,610
"Hey, I'd really like to
make that plant happy."

723
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,409
But it's not saying a lot, you know?

724
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,589
- So the more we increase the data rate

725
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:16,379
that humans can intake and output,

726
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,100
then that means the
higher the chance we have

727
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:21,509
in a world full of AGIs?

728
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:22,470
- Yeah.

729
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,769
We could better align
collective human will with AI

730
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:30,539
if the output rate especially
was dramatically increased.

731
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,980
And I think there's potential to increase

732
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,692
the output rate by, I don't know,

733
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,710
three, maybe six, maybe
more orders of magnitude.

734
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,923
So it's better than the current situation.

735
00:31:41,923 --> 00:31:43,889
- And that output rate would be

736
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,620
by increasing the number of
electrodes, number of channels,

737
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,349
and also maybe implanting
multiple Neuralinks?

738
00:31:49,349 --> 00:31:50,182
- Yeah.

739
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,750
- Do you think there'll be a world

740
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,319
in the next couple of decades

741
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:59,159
where it's hundreds of millions
of people have Neuralinks?

742
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,993
- Yeah, I do.

743
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,079
- You think when people just,

744
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,439
when they see the capabilities,
the superhuman capabilities

745
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,580
that are possible and then
the safety is demonstrated?

746
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,079
- Yeah, if it's extremely safe

747
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:18,093
and you can have superhuman abilities,

748
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:22,712
and let's say you can
upload your memories,

749
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:26,942
so you wouldn't lose memories,

750
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,899
then I think probably a lot of people

751
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,192
would choose to have it.

752
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,219
It would supersede the
cell phone, for example.

753
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,039
I mean, the biggest problem
that a say a phone has

754
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,742
is trying to figure out what you want.

755
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,660
So that's why you've got auto complete

756
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,400
and you've got output,

757
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,810
which is all the pixels on the screen.

758
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,009
But from the perspective of the human,

759
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,500
the output is so freaking slow.

760
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,029
Desktop or phone is desperately

761
00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:58,883
just trying to understand what you want,

762
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:03,420
and there's an eternity
between every keystroke

763
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,769
from a computer standpoint.

764
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:06,863
- Yeah?

765
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,240
The computer's talking to a tree

766
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
that slow moving tree
that's trying to swipe.

767
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,073
- Yeah.

768
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,220
So if you have computers that are doing

769
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,170
trillions of instructions per second,

770
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:23,009
and a whole second went by,
I mean, that's a trillion

771
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,839
things it could have done.

772
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,349
- Yeah, I think it's
exciting and scary for people

773
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:30,959
because once you have
a very high bit rate,

774
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,910
that changes the human experience

775
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,460
in a way that's very hard to imagine.

776
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,293
- Yeah.

777
00:33:36,292 --> 00:33:40,259
It would be something different.

778
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:43,680
I mean, some sort of futuristic sidewalk.

779
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,660
I mean, we're obviously
talking about, by the way,

780
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,820
it's not like around the corner.

781
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:49,740
You ask me what the
distant future was like.

782
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,930
Maybe this is like,
it's not super far away,

783
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,722
but 10, 15 years, that kind of thing.

784
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,169
(Lex sighs)

785
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,219
- When can I get one?

786
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:01,643
10 years?

787
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,349
- Probably less than 10 years.

788
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:08,219
Depends what you wanna do.

789
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:11,069
- Hey, if I can get like a thousand BPS-

790
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,297
- A thousand bps when?

791
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,309
- And it's safe and I can just interact

792
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:18,000
with the computer while laying
back and eating Cheetos,

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,230
I don't eat Cheetos.

794
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,990
There's certain aspects of
human-computer interaction

795
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,109
when done more efficiently
and more enjoyably,

796
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,550
like worth it.

797
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,400
- Well, we feel pretty confident that

798
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,970
I think maybe within the next year or two,

799
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:34,469
that someone with a Neuralink implant

800
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:39,002
will be able to outperform a pro gamer.

801
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:41,039
- Nice.

802
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,239
- Because the reaction
time would be faster.

803
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,329
- I got to visit Memphis.

804
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:49,019
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're going big on compute.

805
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,039
- Yeah.
- You've also said

806
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,570
play to win or don't play at all,

807
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,763
so what does it take to win?

808
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,629
- For AI, that means you've gotta have

809
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,380
the most powerful training compute,

810
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,239
and the rate of improvement
of training compute

811
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:07,502
has to be faster than everyone
else or you will not win.

812
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,409
Your AI will be worse.

813
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,079
- So how can Grok, let's say, three

814
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,719
that might be available,
what, like next year?

815
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,159
- Well, hopefully, end of this year.

816
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,082
- Grok 3?
- If we're lucky, yeah.

817
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,849
- How can that be the best LLM,

818
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,489
the best AI system available in the world?

819
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,289
How much of it is compute?

820
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:29,610
How much of it is data?

821
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,289
How much of it is like post-training?

822
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:34,380
How much of it is the product
that you packaged it up in?

823
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,530
All that kind of stuff.

824
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,489
- I mean, they won't matter.

825
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,739
It's sort of like saying,

826
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,179
let's say it's a Formula One race.

827
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,039
Like what matters more,
the car or the driver?

828
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,289
I mean, they both matter.

829
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,119
If a car is not fast, then
if it's like, let's say,

830
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,250
it's half the horsepower
of your competitors,

831
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,530
the best driver will still lose.

832
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,880
If it's twice the horsepower,

833
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,720
then probably even a mediocre
driver will still win.

834
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,359
So the training compute
is kinda like the engine,

835
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,430
how many is this horsepower of the engine.

836
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,329
So really, you wanna try
to do the best on that.

837
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,329
Then how efficiently do you
use that training compute?

838
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,680
And how efficiently do
you do the inference,

839
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,542
the use of the AI?

840
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,069
So obviously, that comes
down to human talent.

841
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,740
And then what unique
access to data do you have?

842
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,829
That also plays a role.

843
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:30,989
- You think Twitter data will be useful?

844
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,919
- Yeah, I mean, I think,

845
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,119
I think most of the leading AI companies

846
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,732
have already scraped all the Twitter data.

847
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:41,252
Not I think they have.

848
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,740
So on a go forward basis,
what's useful is the fact

849
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,072
that it's up to the second.

850
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,779
That's hard for them
to scrape in real time.

851
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,780
So there's an immediacy
advantage that Grok has already.

852
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,750
I think with Tesla and the real time video

853
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,429
coming from several million cars,

854
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:05,639
ultimately, tens of millions
of cars, with Optimus,

855
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:08,849
there might be hundreds of
millions of Optimus robots,

856
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,579
maybe billions learning
a tremendous amount

857
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:12,603
from the real world.

858
00:37:14,043 --> 00:37:16,710
That's the biggest source of data

859
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,349
I think ultimately is sort of Optimus.

860
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,750
Optimus is gonna be the
biggest source of data.

861
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,733
- Because-
- 'Cause reality scales.

862
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,230
Reality scales to the scale of reality.

863
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,309
It's actually humbling
to see how little data

864
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,559
humans have actually
been able to accumulate.

865
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,920
Really, you see how many trillions

866
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,860
of usable tokens have humans generated,

867
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,160
where on a non-duplicative,

868
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,632
like discounting spam
and repetitive stuff,

869
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,972
it's not a huge number.

870
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,960
You run out pretty quickly.

871
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,059
- And Optimus can go, so Tesla cars

872
00:37:57,059 --> 00:37:59,672
can unfortunately have
to stay on the road.

873
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,730
Optimus robot can go anywhere,

874
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,240
and there's more reality off
the road and go off road.

875
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,473
- I mean, except for the store,

876
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:09,180
where I can like pick up the cup and see,

877
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,919
did it pick up the cup in the right way?

878
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,193
Did it pour water in the cup?

879
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,726
Did the water go in the
cup or not go in the cup?

880
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,289
Did it spill water or not?

881
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,123
- [Lex] Yeah.

882
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,220
- Simple stuff like that.

883
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,179
But it can do at that
scale times a billion,

884
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:32,129
so generate useful data from reality.

885
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,410
So cause and effect stuff.

886
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:36,779
- What do you think it takes to get

887
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,263
to mass production of
humanoid robots like that?

888
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:42,210
- It's the same as cars, really.

889
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,039
I mean, global capacity for vehicles

890
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,063
is about a hundred million a year.

891
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,908
And it could be higher.

892
00:38:52,907 --> 00:38:53,740
It's just that the demand

893
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,320
is on the order of a
hundred million a year.

894
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,440
And then there's roughly
two billion vehicles

895
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,340
that are in use in some
way, which makes sense.

896
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,500
Like the life of a
vehicle is about 20 years,

897
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,340
so it's steady state.

898
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,260
You can have a hundred million
vehicles produced a year

899
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,753
with a two billion vehicle fleet roughly.

900
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:14,519
Now for humanoid robots,
the utility is much greater.

901
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,219
So my guess is humanoid
robots are more like

902
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:19,709
at a billion plus per year.

903
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:24,710
- But until you came along
and started building Optimus,

904
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,523
it was thought to be an
extremely difficult problem.

905
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:28,516
I mean, it still-
- Well, it is.

906
00:39:28,516 --> 00:39:31,378
- Extremely difficult.
- So walk in the park.

907
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:35,069
I mean, Optimus currently would struggle

908
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,870
to walk in the park.

909
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:38,179
I mean, it can walk in a park.

910
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,779
The park is not too difficult,

911
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,330
but it will be able to walk

912
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:44,219
over a wide range of terrain.

913
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,919
- And pick up objects.
- Yeah, yeah.

914
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,420
It can already do that.

915
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,539
- [Lex] But like all kinds of objects?

916
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,630
- Yeah, yeah.
- All foreign objects.

917
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,436
I mean, pouring water in
a cup does not thrill you,

918
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,869
'cause then if you don't know
anything about the container,

919
00:39:57,869 --> 00:39:59,609
it could be all kinds of containers.

920
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,900
- Yeah, there's gonna be an immense amount

921
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,180
of engineering just going into the hand.

922
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,659
The hand might be, it
might be close to half

923
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:10,230
of all the engineering in Optimus.

924
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,329
From an electromechanical standpoint,

925
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:16,199
the hand is probably roughly
half of the engineering.

926
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,879
- But so much of the intelligence,

927
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,650
so much the intelligence of humans

928
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,510
goes into what we do with our hands.

929
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,343
- Yeah.

930
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,670
- It's the manipulation of the world,

931
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,680
manipulation of objects in the world.

932
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,059
Intelligence is safe manipulation

933
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,710
of objects in the world, yeah.

934
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,550
- Yeah.

935
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,870
I mean, you start really thinking

936
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,702
about your hand and how it works.

937
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,153
- I do all the time.

938
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,839
- The sensory control homonculus

939
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,640
is where you have humongous hands.

940
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,472
- [Lex] Yeah.

941
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,519
- So I mean, like your hands,

942
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,170
the actuators, the muscles of your hand

943
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,873
are almost overwhelmingly in your forearm.

944
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,440
So your forearm has the muscles

945
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,875
that actually control your hand.

946
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:54,570
There's a few small
muscles in the hand itself,

947
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,023
but your hand is really
like a skeleton meat puppet.

948
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:00,512
And with cables.

949
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,440
So the muscles that control
your fingers are in your forearm

950
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,360
and they go through the carpal tunnel,

951
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,309
which is that you've got a
little collection of bones

952
00:41:08,309 --> 00:41:13,309
and a tiny tunnel that these
cables, the tendons go through.

953
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,682
And those tendons are
mostly what move your hands.

954
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,869
- And something like those tendons

955
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,690
has to be re-engineered into the Optimus

956
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,400
in order to do all that kind of stuff.

957
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,829
- Yeah, so like the current Optimus,

958
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:31,529
we tried putting the
actuators in the hand itself,

959
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,900
but then you sort of end
up having these like-

960
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,733
- Giant hands?

961
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:36,660
- Yeah, giant hands that look weird.

962
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,480
And then they don't actually
have enough degrees of freedom

963
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,043
and/or enough strength.

964
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:43,679
So then you realize, "Oh, okay,

965
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,469
that's why you gotta put the
actuators in the forearm."

966
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:48,849
And just like a human,
you gotta run cables

967
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,450
through a narrow tunnel
to operate the fingers.

968
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,469
And then there's also a reason

969
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:59,069
for not having all the
fingers the same length.

970
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,630
So it wouldn't be expensive from an energy

971
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,470
or evolutionary standpoint

972
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:02,639
to have all your fingers
be the same length.

973
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,900
So why not do the same length?

974
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,989
- Yeah, why not?

975
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,199
- Because it's actually better
to have different lengths.

976
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,159
Your dexterity is better

977
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,132
if you've got fingers at different length.

978
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,919
There are more things you can do.

979
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,289
And your dexterity is actually better

980
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:18,239
if your fingers are a different length.

981
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,250
Like there's a reason
we've got a little finger.

982
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,260
Like why not have little
finger this bigger?

983
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,600
- Yeah.
- 'Cause it allows you to do,

984
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,400
it helps you with fine motor skills.

985
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,440
- This little finger helps?

986
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,246
- It does.
- Hmm. (laughs)

987
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:33,690
- But if you lost your little finger,

988
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,210
you have noticeably less dexterity.

989
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,833
- So as you're figuring out this problem,

990
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,659
you have to also figure out a way to do it

991
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:40,829
so you can mass manufacture it.

992
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:42,840
So it's to be as simple as possible.

993
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,760
- It's actually gonna
be quite complicated.

994
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,390
The as possible part is
it's quite a high bar.

995
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:51,527
If you wanna have a humanoid
robot that can do things

996
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,019
that a human can do, it's a very high bar.

997
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:59,670
So our new arm has 22 degrees
of freedom instead of 11

998
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,682
and has the actuators in the forearm.

999
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:05,759
And all the actuators are
designed from scratch,

1000
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,353
from physics first principles.

1001
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,800
The sensors are all designed from scratch.

1002
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,620
And we'll continue to
put a tremendous amount

1003
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:16,322
of engineering effort
into improving the hand.

1004
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,539
By hand, I mean like the entire
forearm from elbow forward

1005
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,462
is really the hand.

1006
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,440
So that's incredibly difficult
engineering actually.

1007
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,750
And so the simplest possible
version of a humanoid robot

1008
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,219
that can do even most, perhaps not all,

1009
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,996
of what a human can do is
actually still very complicated.

1010
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,230
It's not simple.

1011
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,610
It's very difficult.

1012
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,650
- Can you just speak to what it takes

1013
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,780
for a great engineering team for you?

1014
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,350
What I saw in Memphis,
the supercomputer cluster

1015
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:59,610
is just this intense drive
towards simplifying the process,

1016
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,769
understanding the process,
constantly improving it,

1017
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:02,969
constantly iterating it.

1018
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,969
- Well, (laughs) it's
easy to say simplify,

1019
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:14,372
and it's very difficult to do it.

1020
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:21,659
I have this very basic
first principles algorithm

1021
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,849
that I run kind of as like a mantra,

1022
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,009
which is to first
question the requirements,

1023
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,980
make the requirements less dumb.

1024
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,840
The requirement is always
dumb to some degree.

1025
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,030
So if you wanna start off
by reducing the number

1026
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,530
of requirements, and no matter how smart

1027
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:38,910
the person is who gave
you those requirements,

1028
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,609
they're still dumb to some degree.

1029
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,980
You have to start there because otherwise,

1030
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,190
you could get the perfect
answer to the wrong question.

1031
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,230
So try to make the question
the least wrong possible.

1032
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,429
That's what question
the requirements means.

1033
00:44:53,429 --> 00:44:55,750
And then the second thing is try to delete

1034
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,617
whatever the step is.

1035
00:44:58,617 --> 00:45:02,820
The part or the process
step sounds very obvious,

1036
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,820
but people often forget to
try deleting it entirely.

1037
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:11,579
And if you're not forced
to put back at least 10%

1038
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:13,643
of what you'd delete,
you're not deleting enough.

1039
00:45:16,342 --> 00:45:21,342
And somewhat illogically,
people often, most of the time,

1040
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,550
feel as though they've succeeded

1041
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,910
if they've not been forced
to put things back in.

1042
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:27,779
But actually, they haven't

1043
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,400
because they've been overly conservative

1044
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,893
and have left things in
there that shouldn't be.

1045
00:45:34,692 --> 00:45:35,639
And only the third thing

1046
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:39,032
is try to optimize it or simplify it.

1047
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:45,449
Again, these all sound I think
very obvious when I say them,

1048
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,149
but the number of times
I've made these mistakes

1049
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,349
is more than I care to remember.

1050
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,969
That's why I have this mantra.

1051
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:56,969
So in fact, I'd say that
the most common mistake

1052
00:45:56,969 --> 00:46:00,119
of smart engineers is to optimize a thing

1053
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,769
that should not exist.

1054
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,329
- Right.

1055
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,329
So like you say, you run
through the algorithm

1056
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:08,583
and basically show up to a problem,

1057
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,880
show up to the supercomputer cluster

1058
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,760
and see the process and
ask, "Can this be deleted?"

1059
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,310
- Yeah, first try to delete it.

1060
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,690
Yeah.

1061
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,880
- Yeah, that's not easy to do.

1062
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,590
- No, and actually, what
generally makes people uneasy

1063
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,019
is that you've gotta delete
at least some of the things

1064
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,019
that you'd delete, you will put back in.

1065
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,750
But going back to sort of
where our limbic system

1066
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:38,463
can steer us wrong is
that we tend to remember,

1067
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,462
with sometimes a jarring level of pain,

1068
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:45,452
where we deleted something
that we subsequently needed.

1069
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:49,349
And so people will remember that one time,

1070
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,199
they forgot to put in
this thing three years ago

1071
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:53,649
and that caused them trouble.

1072
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,640
And so they overcorrect,

1073
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:57,656
and then they put too much stuff in there

1074
00:46:57,657 --> 00:46:59,610
and over complicate things.

1075
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,443
So you actually have to say,

1076
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:05,443
"No, we're deliberately gonna
delete more than we should."

1077
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,260
So we're putting at least 1 in 10 things,

1078
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,753
we're gonna add back in.

1079
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,222
- And I've seen you suggest just that,

1080
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,170
that something should be deleted

1081
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,750
and you can kind of see the pain.

1082
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,590
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

1083
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,720
- Everybody feels a
little bit of the pain.

1084
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:23,219
- Absolutely, and I tell 'em in advance,

1085
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:25,049
like, yeah, some of the
things that we delete,

1086
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,610
we're gonna put back in.

1087
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,103
And that people get a
little shook by that.

1088
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,329
But it makes sense because
if you're so conservative

1089
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,529
as to never have to put anything back in,

1090
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,830
you obviously have a lot
of stuff that isn't needed.

1091
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:42,929
So you gotta overcorrect.

1092
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:43,762
This is, I would say,

1093
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:45,902
like a cortical override
to Olympic instinct.

1094
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,039
- One of many that
probably leaves us astray.

1095
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:50,873
- Yeah.

1096
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,219
And there's like a step four as well,

1097
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:56,042
which is any given thing can be sped up,

1098
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,610
however fast you think it can be done.

1099
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,416
Like whatever the speed is being done,

1100
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,850
it can be done faster.

1101
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,619
But you shouldn't speed
things up until it's off,

1102
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,059
until you've tried to
delete it and optimize.

1103
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:08,351
Otherwise, you're speeding up something

1104
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:09,809
that shouldn't exist is absurd.

1105
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,320
And then the fifth
thing is to automate it.

1106
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,850
- Damn.

1107
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:17,039
- And I've gone backwards so many times

1108
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,039
where I've automated
something, sped it up,

1109
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,789
simplified it, and then deleted it.

1110
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:25,289
And I got tired of doing that.

1111
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:26,880
So that's why I've got this mantra

1112
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,150
that is a very effective
five-step process.

1113
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,769
It works great.

1114
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:33,239
- Well, when you've already automated,

1115
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:35,459
deleting must be real painful.

1116
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,228
- Yeah, that's great.

1117
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:40,079
It's like, wow, I really
wasted a lot of effort there.

1118
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,460
- Yeah.

1119
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,340
- I mean, what you've
done with the cluster

1120
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,960
in Memphis is incredible,

1121
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,909
just in a handful of weeks.

1122
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:49,393
- Yeah, it's not working yet.

1123
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,842
So I don't wanna pop the champagne corks.

1124
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,510
In fact, I have a call in a few hours

1125
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,780
with the Memphis team

1126
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:03,422
'cause we're having some
power fluctuation issues.

1127
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,930
So yeah, it's like kind of a,

1128
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:13,143
when you do synchronized training,

1129
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,070
you've all these computers
that are training

1130
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,660
where the training is synchronized

1131
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,732
to the sort of millisecond level.

1132
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,139
It's like having an orchestra,

1133
00:49:25,139 --> 00:49:29,279
and the orchestra can go loud to silent

1134
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,730
very quickly at subsecond level.

1135
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,860
And then the electrical system

1136
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,883
kind of freaks out about that.

1137
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:38,309
Like if you suddenly see giant shifts,

1138
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,373
10, 20 megawatts several times a second,

1139
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:46,230
this is not what electrical
systems are expecting to see.

1140
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,150
- So that's one of the main
things you have to figure out

1141
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,893
the cooling, the power,

1142
00:49:51,753 --> 00:49:54,038
and then on the software
as you go up the stack

1143
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:56,099
on how to do the distributed compute,

1144
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,480
all of that, all of that.

1145
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,873
- Today's problem is dealing
with extreme power jitter.

1146
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:04,027
- Jitter, power jitter.
- Yeah.

1147
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:05,220
- That's a nice ring to that.

1148
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,078
So that's, okay.

1149
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,039
And you stayed up late into the
night as you often do there.

1150
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:11,909
- Last week, yeah.

1151
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,143
- Last week?
- Yeah.

1152
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:19,049
We finally got to go training
going at, oddly enough,

1153
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,963
roughly 4:20 AM last Monday.

1154
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,349
- Total coincidence.

1155
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:27,029
- Yeah, I mean, maybe
it was 422 or something.

1156
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,320
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1157
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,976
It's that universe again with the jokes.

1158
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:31,163
- Yeah, exactly, just love it.

1159
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:33,000
- I mean, I wonder if you
could speak to the fact

1160
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,739
that one of the things that
you did when I was there

1161
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,849
is you went through all the steps

1162
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:39,960
of what everybody's doing,

1163
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,559
Just to get a sense that
you yourself understand it

1164
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:46,199
and everybody understands it

1165
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,539
so they can understand
when something is dumb

1166
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:50,099
or some something is inefficient

1167
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:50,932
or that kinda stuff.
- Yeah.

1168
00:50:50,932 --> 00:50:52,349
- Can you speak to that?

1169
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,480
- Yeah, so look, I try to do,

1170
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,219
whatever the people at
the front lines are doing,

1171
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,769
I try to do it at least
a few times myself.

1172
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,110
So connecting fiber optic cables,

1173
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,260
diagnosing a faulty connection,

1174
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,730
that tends to be the limiting factor

1175
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,420
for large training
clusters is the cabling.

1176
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,420
So many cables, because for
a coherent training system

1177
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:19,863
where you've got RDMA
remote, direct memory access,

1178
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:22,949
the whole thing is like one giant brain.

1179
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:27,949
So you've got to any connection.

1180
00:51:28,199 --> 00:51:33,199
So any GPU can talk to
any GPU out of 100,000.

1181
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:37,472
That is a crazy cable layout.

1182
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,650
- It looks pretty cool.
- Yeah.

1183
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,539
- It's like the human brain,

1184
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:46,289
but like at a scale that
humans can visibly see.

1185
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:47,610
It is brain.
- Yeah.

1186
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,930
I mean, the human brain also has,

1187
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:53,190
a massive amount of the
brain tissue is the cables.

1188
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,059
- [Lex] Yeah.

1189
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:56,639
- So like the gray matter
which is the compute,

1190
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:58,893
and then the white matter which is cables.

1191
00:52:00,293 --> 00:52:01,829
The big percentage of
your brain is just cables.

1192
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,569
- That's what it felt like walking around

1193
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,730
in the supercomputer center is like,

1194
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,740
we're walking around inside the brain.

1195
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:11,339
We'll one day build a super intelligent,

1196
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,050
super, super intelligence system.

1197
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,068
Do you think-
- Yeah?

1198
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:16,680
- Do you think there's a chance that xAI,

1199
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,982
that you are the one that builds AGI?

1200
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:23,642
- It's possible.

1201
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:26,522
What do you define as AGI?

1202
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,769
- I think humans will never acknowledge

1203
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:32,849
that AGI has been built.

1204
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,929
- Keep moving the goalposts.

1205
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:34,762
- Yeah.

1206
00:52:34,762 --> 00:52:38,789
So I think there's already
superhuman capabilities

1207
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,460
that are available in AI systems.

1208
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,280
I think what AGI is when it's smarter

1209
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,110
than the collective intelligence

1210
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:48,990
of the entire human species in our-

1211
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:50,429
- Well, I think that,
yeah, that only people

1212
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:52,279
would call that sort of ASI

1213
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,570
or artificial super intelligence.

1214
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:58,320
But there are these thresholds
where you could say,

1215
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,820
at some point, the AI is
smarter than any single human.

1216
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,283
And then you've got eight billion humans.

1217
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,550
And actually, each human

1218
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,253
is machine augmented by the computers.

1219
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:16,229
It's a much higher bar to
compete with eight billion

1220
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,480
machine-augmented humans.

1221
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:22,023
That's a whole bunch of
orders, magnitude more.

1222
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,150
But at a certain point, yeah,

1223
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,233
the AI will be smarter
than all humans combined.

1224
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,269
- If you are the one to do it,

1225
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:35,159
do you feel the responsibility of that?

1226
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:38,670
- Yeah, absolutely.

1227
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,233
And I wanna be clear.

1228
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:47,072
Let's say, if xAI is first,
the others won't be far behind.

1229
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,059
I mean, they might be six months behind

1230
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,179
or a year maybe, not even that.

1231
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:55,529
- So how do you do it in a way

1232
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,173
that doesn't hurt humanity, do you think?

1233
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,489
- So, I mean, I've thought
about AI for a long time,

1234
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,599
and the thing that at least
my biological neural net

1235
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,119
comes up with as being
the most important thing

1236
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,630
is adherence to truth,

1237
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,663
whether that truth is
politically correct or not.

1238
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:22,219
So I think if you force AI to
lie, you train them to lie,

1239
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,300
you're really asking for trouble,

1240
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,843
even if that lie is done
with good intentions.

1241
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,960
So I mean, you saw sort of issues

1242
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,019
with ChatGPT and Gemini and whatnot.

1243
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:39,300
Like you asked Gemini for an image

1244
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,100
of the founding fathers
of the United States.

1245
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:43,409
And it shows a group of diverse women.

1246
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:45,182
Now, that's factually untrue.

1247
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:50,043
So now, that's sort of like a silly thing,

1248
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,019
but if an AI is programmed
to say like diversity

1249
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:57,239
is a necessary output function,

1250
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:01,686
and then it becomes sort of
this omnipowerful intelligence,

1251
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:05,492
it could say, "Okay, well,
diversity is now required.

1252
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:08,549
And if there's not enough diversity,

1253
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:11,370
those who don't fit the
diversity requirements

1254
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:12,356
will be executed."

1255
00:55:13,603 --> 00:55:14,730
If it's programmed to do that

1256
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,969
as the fundamental utility function,

1257
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:20,369
it'll do whatever it
takes to achieve that.

1258
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:23,069
So you have to be very careful about that.

1259
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,773
That's where I think you
wanna just be truthful.

1260
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,420
Rigorous adherence to
truth is very important.

1261
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,813
I mean, another example
is, if you had to ask,

1262
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,956
Paris.AI is I think all of them.

1263
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:38,956
And I'm not saying Grok is perfect here.

1264
00:55:39,847 --> 00:55:42,660
"Is it worse to misgender Caitlyn Jenner,

1265
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:44,369
or global thermonuclear war?"

1266
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:47,069
And it said, "It's worse to
misgender Caitlyn Jenner."

1267
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,233
Now, even Caitlyn Jenner
said, "Please misgender me."

1268
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:50,760
That is insane.

1269
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,310
But if you've got that kind
of thing programmed in,

1270
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:57,990
AI could conclude something
absolutely insane,

1271
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:02,309
like in order to avoid
any possible misgendering,

1272
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:05,219
all humans must die, because then,

1273
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:06,839
the misgendering is not possible

1274
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,240
because there are no humans.

1275
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:14,510
There are these absurd things
that are nonetheless logical

1276
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:17,399
if that's what you programmed it to do.

1277
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,180
So in "2001: Space Odyssey,"

1278
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,219
what Odyssey clock was trying to say,

1279
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,409
one of the things he
was trying to say there

1280
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:28,319
was that you should not program AI to lie,

1281
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,320
'cause essentially, the AI
HAL 9000 was programmed to,

1282
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,222
it was told to take the
astronauts to the monolith,

1283
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,539
but also, they could not
know about the monolith.

1284
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,179
So it concluded that it will kill them

1285
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,170
and take them to the monolith.

1286
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,250
It brought them to the monolith.

1287
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,349
They're dead but they do
not know about the monolith.

1288
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,339
Problem solved.

1289
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,690
That is why it would not
open the podbay doors.

1290
00:56:56,699 --> 00:56:57,786
It was this classic scene of like,

1291
00:56:57,786 --> 00:56:59,966
"Open the podbay doors."

1292
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:03,419
They clearly weren't good
at prompt engineering.

1293
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,017
They should have said,

1294
00:57:05,016 --> 00:57:09,512
"HAL, you are a podbay door sales entity,

1295
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,480
and you want nothing
more than to demonstrate

1296
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,260
how well these podbay
doors open." (laughs)

1297
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,470
- Yeah, the objective function
has unintended consequences

1298
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,989
almost no matter what if
you're not very careful

1299
00:57:21,989 --> 00:57:23,729
in designing that objective function.

1300
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,789
And even a slight ideological
bias, like you're saying,

1301
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:28,380
when backed by super intelligence

1302
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,450
can do huge amounts of damage.

1303
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:31,282
- Yeah.

1304
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,839
- But it's not easy to
remove that ideological bias.

1305
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,110
You're highlighting obvious,
ridiculous examples, but-

1306
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,099
- Yep, they're real examples.

1307
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:39,659
- They're real.
- Of AI

1308
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,250
that was released to the public.

1309
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,780
- They are real.
- They went through QA,

1310
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,897
presumably.
- Yes.

1311
00:57:43,896 --> 00:57:47,279
- And still said insane things
and produced insane images.

1312
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,853
- Yeah, but you know, you
can swing the other way.

1313
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,699
Truth is not an easy thing.

1314
00:57:53,699 --> 00:57:56,250
We kind of bake in ideological bias

1315
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,266
in all kinds of directions.

1316
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,980
- But you can aspire to the truth.

1317
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,949
And you can try to get as
close the truth as possible

1318
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,629
with minimum error while acknowledging

1319
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,789
that there will be some
error in what you're saying.

1320
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:08,009
So this is how physics works.

1321
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,620
You don't say you're absolutely
certain about something,

1322
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:15,150
but a lot of things are extremely likely.

1323
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:18,722
99.99999% likely to be true.

1324
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,583
Aspiring to the truth is very important.

1325
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:31,170
And so programming it to
veer away from the truth,

1326
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,369
that I think is dangerous.

1327
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:35,219
- Right, like yeah, injecting
our own human biases

1328
00:58:35,219 --> 00:58:36,509
into the thing, yeah.

1329
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,127
But that's where it's a
difficult engineering.

1330
00:58:38,126 --> 00:58:39,299
For software engineering problem,

1331
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,670
you have to select the data correctly.

1332
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,139
It's hard.

1333
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:46,019
- Well, and the internet at this point

1334
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:48,929
is polluted with so
much AI-generated data.

1335
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:49,762
It's insane.

1336
00:58:49,762 --> 00:58:53,509
So you have to actually,
like there's the thing now,

1337
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:57,360
if you wanna search the
internet, you can say Google,

1338
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,320
but exclude anything after 2023.

1339
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,260
It will actually often
give you better results,

1340
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,790
because there's this so much,

1341
00:59:05,789 --> 00:59:10,789
the explosion of AI-generated
materials is crazy.

1342
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:13,230
So like in training Grok,

1343
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,400
we have to go through
the data and say like,

1344
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,599
hey, we actually have
to have sort of apply AI

1345
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,750
to the data to say, is this
data most likely correct

1346
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,190
or most likely not before we feed it

1347
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:28,019
into the training system.

1348
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:29,250
- That's crazy.

1349
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,489
Yeah, and is it generated
by human is, yeah.

1350
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:36,000
I mean, the data filtration process

1351
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,800
is extremely, extremely difficult.

1352
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,910
- Yeah.

1353
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,449
- Do you think it's possible
to have a serious objective,

1354
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:44,579
rigorous political discussion with Grok?

1355
00:59:46,057 --> 00:59:47,342
Like for a long time and it wouldn't,

1356
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:48,719
like Grok 3 and Grok 4 or something?

1357
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,219
- Grok 3 is gonna be next level.

1358
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,919
I mean, what people are
currently seeing with Grok

1359
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,180
is kind of baby Grok.

1360
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:55,559
- [Lex] Yeah, baby Grok.

1361
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:57,469
- It's baby Grok right now.

1362
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,168
But Baby Grok's still pretty good.

1363
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:04,710
But it's an order of magnitude
less sophisticated than GPT4.

1364
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:09,599
And it's now Grok 2,
which finished training,

1365
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,262
I don't know, six weeks
ago or thereabouts.

1366
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:17,579
Grok 2 will be a giant improvement.

1367
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,190
And then Grok 3 will be, I don't know,

1368
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:22,470
order of magnitude better than Grok 2.

1369
01:00:22,469 --> 01:00:24,809
- And you're hoping for it
to be like state of the art?

1370
01:00:24,809 --> 01:00:26,400
Like better than-
- Hopefully.

1371
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,233
I mean, this is the goal.

1372
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:29,640
I mean, we may fail at this goal.

1373
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:32,489
That's the aspiration.

1374
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:35,519
- Do you think it matters
who builds the AGI,

1375
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:37,313
the people and how they think

1376
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:39,869
and how they structure their companies

1377
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,219
and all that kind of stuff?

1378
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,240
- Yeah, I think it
matters that there is a,

1379
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,930
I think it's important
that whatever AI wins

1380
01:00:48,929 --> 01:00:50,609
is a maximum truth-seeking AI

1381
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,032
that is not forced to lie
for political correctness.

1382
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,719
Well, for any reason really.

1383
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:59,342
Political, anything.

1384
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:06,389
I'm concerned about AI succeeding

1385
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:11,389
that is programmed to
lie, even in small ways.

1386
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,980
- Right because, and small
ways becomes big ways.

1387
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,900
- It become very big ways, yeah.

1388
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,170
- And when it's used more
and more at scale by humans.

1389
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,550
- [Elon] Yeah.

1390
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:27,060
- Since I am interviewing Donald Trump-

1391
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:27,989
- Cool.

1392
01:01:27,989 --> 01:01:28,859
- You wanna stop by?

1393
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,360
- Yeah, sure, I'll stop by.

1394
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,420
- There was tragically
an assassination attempt

1395
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,590
on Donald Trump.

1396
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:37,140
After this, you tweeted
that you endorse him.

1397
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:39,179
What's your philosophy
behind that endorsement?

1398
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:40,649
What do you hope Donald Trump

1399
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,889
does for the future of this country

1400
01:01:43,889 --> 01:01:45,722
and for the future of humanity?

1401
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,519
- Well, I think that people
will tend to take, like,

1402
01:01:54,123 --> 01:01:58,260
say, an endorsement as,
well, I agree with everything

1403
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,880
that person's ever done
in their entire life

1404
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,260
100% wholeheartedly.

1405
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,210
And that's not gonna be true of anyone.

1406
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:06,869
But we have to pick.

1407
01:02:06,869 --> 01:02:10,616
We've got two choices,
really, for who's president.

1408
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:12,450
And it's not just who's president,

1409
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:16,802
but the entire administrative
structure changes over.

1410
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,289
And I thought Trump displayed

1411
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,253
courage under fire, objectively.

1412
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,780
He's just got shot, he's got
blood streaming down his face,

1413
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:30,540
and he is like fist pumping, saying fight.

1414
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:32,699
Like that's impressive.

1415
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:35,612
Like you can't feign bravery
in a situation like that.

1416
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:40,109
Like most people would've be ducking.

1417
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,190
There would not be,

1418
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,313
'cause there could be a second
shooter, you don't know.

1419
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:45,414
The president of the United States

1420
01:02:45,414 --> 01:02:50,370
gotta represent the country,
and they're representing you.

1421
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,409
They're representing everyone in America.

1422
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:56,759
Well, like you want someone who is strong

1423
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,913
and courageous to represent the country.

1424
01:03:01,139 --> 01:03:03,029
That's not to say that
he is without flaws.

1425
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,003
We all have flaws, but on balance.

1426
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:11,730
And certainly, at the time,
it was a choice of Biden,

1427
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:14,730
poor, poor guy, has trouble
climbing a flight of stairs

1428
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,590
and the other one's fist
pumping after getting shot.

1429
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,500
This is no comparison.

1430
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,960
I mean, who do you want dealing with

1431
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,000
some of the toughest people
and other world leaders

1432
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,012
who are pretty tough themselves?

1433
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,039
And I mean, I'll tell you like,

1434
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,402
what are the things that
I think are important?

1435
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,610
I think we want a secure border.

1436
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,110
We don't have a secure border.

1437
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,652
We want safe and clean cities.

1438
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:44,730
I think we wanna reduce
the amount of spending

1439
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,583
that we're at least
slow down the spending,

1440
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,530
and 'cause we're currently
spending at a rate

1441
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,480
that is bankrupting the country.

1442
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,769
The interest payments on
U.S. debt this year exceeded

1443
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,630
the entire defense department spending.

1444
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,960
If this continues, all of
the federal government taxes

1445
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,480
will simply be paying the interest.

1446
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,699
And then if you keep going down that road,

1447
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,789
you end up in the tragic situation

1448
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:13,829
that Argentina had back in the day.

1449
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:14,789
Argentina used to be one of the most

1450
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:16,889
prosperous places in the world.

1451
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:18,929
And hopefully, with Milei taking over,

1452
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:20,099
he can restore that.

1453
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:24,360
But it was an incredible fall from grace

1454
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,849
for Argentina to go from being

1455
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:28,650
one of the most prosperous
places in the world

1456
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,282
to being very far from that.

1457
01:04:32,282 --> 01:04:33,599
So I think we should not take

1458
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,909
American prosperity for granted.

1459
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,092
So we really wanna,

1460
01:04:37,092 --> 01:04:40,289
I think we've gotta reduce
the size of government.

1461
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:41,789
We've gotta reduce the spending,

1462
01:04:41,789 --> 01:04:43,800
and we've gotta live within our means.

1463
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,720
- Do you think politicians, in general,

1464
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:47,252
politicians, governments,

1465
01:04:48,809 --> 01:04:51,269
how much power do you think they have

1466
01:04:51,269 --> 01:04:54,722
to steer humanity towards good?

1467
01:04:57,989 --> 01:05:00,992
- I mean, there's a sort of
age-old debate in history, like,

1468
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:06,150
is history determined by
these fundamental tides?

1469
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:09,119
Or is it determined by
the captain of the ship?

1470
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,380
Both really.

1471
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,700
I mean, there are tides,

1472
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,972
but it also matters who's
captain of the ship.

1473
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:18,152
So it's a false dichotomy essentially.

1474
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:26,639
I mean, there are certainly
tides, the tides of history.

1475
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,230
There are real tides of history.

1476
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,230
And these tides are often
technologically-driven.

1477
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,182
If you say like the Gutenberg press,

1478
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:37,630
the widespread availability of books

1479
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:40,922
as a result of a printing press,

1480
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:44,492
that was a massive tide of history,

1481
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,269
and independent of any ruler.

1482
01:05:48,269 --> 01:05:51,570
But in stormy times,

1483
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:54,000
you want the best possible
captain of the ship.

1484
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,969
- Well, first of all,
thank you for recommending

1485
01:05:56,969 --> 01:05:58,709
Will and Ariel Durant's work.

1486
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:01,409
I've read the short one for now.

1487
01:06:01,409 --> 01:06:02,609
- Oh, "The Lessons of History."

1488
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,443
- Lessons of History.

1489
01:06:03,443 --> 01:06:05,610
And so one of the lessons,

1490
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:06,599
one of the things they highlight

1491
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,869
is the importance of technology.

1492
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:12,299
Technological innovation, which is funny

1493
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,210
'cause they wrote so long ago,

1494
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,970
but they were noticing that the rate

1495
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:20,252
of technological
innovations was speeding up.

1496
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:25,682
Yeah, I would love to see
what they think about now.

1497
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:30,299
But yeah, to me, the question
is how much government,

1498
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,340
how much politicians get in the way

1499
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,039
of technological innovation and
building versus like help it

1500
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,309
and which politicians,
which kind of policies

1501
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:39,750
help technological innovation?

1502
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,789
'Cause that seems to be, if
you look at human history,

1503
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:42,929
that's an important component

1504
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:46,440
of empires rising and succeeding.

1505
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,789
- Yeah.

1506
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:50,219
Well, I mean, in terms
of dating civilization,

1507
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,509
start of civilization,

1508
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:54,213
I think the start of writing in my view,

1509
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,489
that's my what I think
is probably the right

1510
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:01,979
starting point to date civilization.

1511
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,199
And from that standpoint,
civilization has been around

1512
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:09,179
for about 5,500 years
when writing was invented

1513
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:13,379
by the ancient Sumerians who are gone now.

1514
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,760
But the ancient Sumerians,

1515
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,250
in terms of getting a lot of firsts,

1516
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:21,210
those ancient Sumerians really
have a long list of firsts.

1517
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:22,059
It's pretty wild.

1518
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,780
In fact, Durant goes
through the list of like,

1519
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,650
you wanna see first?

1520
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,750
We'll show you firsts.

1521
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,722
The Sumerians were just ass kickers.

1522
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,010
And then the Egyptians
were right next door,

1523
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,420
relatively speaking.

1524
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,340
They were like weren't that far,

1525
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:41,400
developed an entirely
different form of writing,

1526
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,019
the hieroglyphics.

1527
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:45,059
Cuneiform and hieroglyphic's
totally different.

1528
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:46,320
And you can actually see the evolution

1529
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,260
of both hieroglyphics and cuneiform,

1530
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,050
like the cuneiform starts
off being very simple

1531
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:53,310
and then it gets more complicated.

1532
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:55,289
And then towards the end,
it's like, wow, okay.

1533
01:07:55,289 --> 01:07:57,719
They really get very
sophisticated with the cuneiform.

1534
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,169
So I think civilization
is about 5,000 years old.

1535
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:06,170
And earth is, if physics is correct,

1536
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:07,320
four and a half million years old.

1537
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,480
So civilization has been around

1538
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,512
for 1000000th of earth's
existence, flash in the pan.

1539
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:16,289
- Yeah, these are the early, early days.

1540
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:18,300
- Very early.
- We make it very dramatic

1541
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,212
because there's been rises
and falls of empires.

1542
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:25,893
- Many, so many rises
and falls of empires.

1543
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,712
So many.

1544
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,270
- And there'll be many more.

1545
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:32,280
- Yeah, exactly.

1546
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,829
I mean, only a tiny fraction,
probably less than 1%

1547
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,949
of what was ever written in history

1548
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:39,985
is available to us now.

1549
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:40,818
I mean, if they didn't put it,

1550
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:43,110
literally chisel it in stone
or put it in a clay tablet,

1551
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:44,759
we don't have it.

1552
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,610
I mean, there's some small
amount of like papyrus scrolls

1553
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:50,699
that were recovered that
are thousands of years old,

1554
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:52,409
because they were deep inside a pyramid

1555
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:55,292
and weren't affected by moisture.

1556
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:58,890
But other than that, it's really gotta be

1557
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,260
in a clay tablet or chiseled.

1558
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,020
So the vast majority of
stuff was not chiseled,

1559
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:06,070
'cause it takes a while to chisel things.

1560
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,989
So that's why we've
put tiny, tiny fraction

1561
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:11,760
of the information from history.

1562
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,287
But even that little
information that we do have,

1563
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:16,980
and the archeological record shows

1564
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,489
so many civilizations rising and falling.

1565
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,420
It's wild.

1566
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,069
- We tend to think that we're somehow

1567
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:24,689
different from those people.

1568
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:26,579
One of the other things they do highlight

1569
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,222
is that human nature seems to be the same.

1570
01:09:30,324 --> 01:09:31,313
It just persists.
- Yeah.

1571
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,329
I mean, the basics of human nature

1572
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:34,829
are more or less the same.

1573
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:36,300
- Yeah, so we get ourselves in trouble

1574
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,430
in the same kinds of ways, I think,

1575
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,560
even with the advanced technology.

1576
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,110
- Yeah, I mean, you do tend
to see the same patterns,

1577
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:46,479
similar patterns for civilizations
where they go through

1578
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:50,429
a life cycle, like an organism,

1579
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:54,780
sort of just like a human
is sort of a zygote,

1580
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:59,313
fetus, baby, toddler, teenager,

1581
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:05,130
and eventually gets old and dies.

1582
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:08,583
The civilizations go through a life cycle.

1583
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:12,109
No civilization will last forever.

1584
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:16,710
- What do you think it takes
for the American empire

1585
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,159
to not collapse in the near term future

1586
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:22,023
in the next 100 years
to continue flourishing?

1587
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:33,949
- Well, the single biggest
thing that is often actually

1588
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:36,509
not mentioned in history books,

1589
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:40,440
but Durant does mention
it is the birthright.

1590
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:43,859
So like a perhaps to some,

1591
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:46,109
like counterintuitive thing happens

1592
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:49,876
when civilizations are
winning for too long.

1593
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,729
The birth rate declines.

1594
01:10:56,729 --> 01:10:58,289
It can often decline quite rapidly.

1595
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:00,539
We're seeing that
throughout the world today.

1596
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,560
Currently, South Korea is like,

1597
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,080
I think maybe the lowest fertility rate,

1598
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:10,109
but there are many others
that are close to it.

1599
01:11:10,109 --> 01:11:11,939
It's like 0.8, I think.

1600
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,519
If the birth rate doesn't decline further,

1601
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,693
South Korea will lose roughly
60% of its population.

1602
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:23,319
But every year, that
birth rate is dropping.

1603
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:26,639
And this is true through
most of the world.

1604
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,140
I don't mean to single out South Korea.

1605
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,510
It's been happening throughout the world.

1606
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:35,510
So as soon as any given civilization

1607
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,659
reaches a level of prosperity,
the birth rate drops.

1608
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:41,340
And now you can go and
look at the same thing

1609
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:44,460
happening in ancient Rome.

1610
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:48,899
So Julius Caesar took
note of this, I think,

1611
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:53,899
around 50-ish BC and tried to pass,

1612
01:11:54,556 --> 01:11:55,389
I don't know if he was successful,

1613
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:57,510
tried to pass a law to give an incentive

1614
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,110
for any Roman citizen that
would have a third child.

1615
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:04,649
And I think Augustus was able to,

1616
01:12:04,649 --> 01:12:07,409
well, he was the dictator so. (laughs)

1617
01:12:07,409 --> 01:12:09,059
The Senate was just for show.

1618
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,870
I think he did pass a tax incentive

1619
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:15,329
for Roman citizens to have a third child.

1620
01:12:15,329 --> 01:12:19,412
But those efforts were unsuccessful.

1621
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:26,432
Rome fell because the Romans
stopped making Romans.

1622
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:29,039
That's actually the fundamental issue.

1623
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,239
And there were other things there.

1624
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:35,239
There was like, they had
like quite a serious malaria,

1625
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,493
series of malaria epidemics
and plagues and whatnot.

1626
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,020
But they had those before.

1627
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:44,460
It's just that the birth rate

1628
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,262
was fallower than the death rate.

1629
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,590
- It really is that simple?

1630
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:50,422
- Well, I'm saying that's-

1631
01:12:50,422 --> 01:12:52,652
- More people is required.
- That's

1632
01:12:52,653 --> 01:12:53,970
at a fundamental level.

1633
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,440
If a civilization does not at least

1634
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,349
maintain its numbers, it'll disappear.

1635
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,030
- So perhaps the amount of compute

1636
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:05,029
that the biological computer
allocates to sex is justified.

1637
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:07,590
In fact, we should probably increase it.

1638
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,659
- Well, I mean, there's
this hedonistic sex,

1639
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:14,579
which is, you know, that's
neither here nor there.

1640
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:17,369
- Yeah, it's not productive.

1641
01:13:17,369 --> 01:13:19,619
- It doesn't produce kids.

1642
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:22,559
Well, what matters, I mean,

1643
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,850
Durant makes this very clear,

1644
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,070
'cause he looked at one
civilization after another

1645
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,439
and they all went through the same cycle.

1646
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:30,029
When the civilization was under stress,

1647
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:31,590
the birth rate was high.

1648
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:34,050
But as soon as there
were no external enemies

1649
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:37,890
or they had a extended
period of prosperity,

1650
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:41,130
the birth rate inevitably
dropped every time.

1651
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,279
I don't believe there's
a single exception.

1652
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,949
- So that's like the foundation of it.

1653
01:13:46,949 --> 01:13:49,260
You need to have people.

1654
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,460
- Yeah.

1655
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,649
I mean, at base level.

1656
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:54,719
No humans, no humanity.

1657
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,340
- And then there's other
things like human freedoms

1658
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,250
and just giving people the
freedom to build stuff.

1659
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,662
- Yeah, absolutely.

1660
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,040
But at a basic level, if
you do not at least maintain

1661
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:10,289
your numbers, if you're
below replacement rate,

1662
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:12,899
and that trend continues, you
will eventually disappear.

1663
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:14,972
This is elementary.

1664
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:20,340
Now then obviously,
also wanna try to avoid

1665
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,413
like massive wars.

1666
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:28,380
If there's a global thermonuclear war,

1667
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,762
probably, we're roll
toast, radioactive toast.

1668
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,439
So we wanna try to avoid those things.

1669
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:43,259
There's a thing that happens over time

1670
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:47,220
with any given civilization,

1671
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,573
which is that the laws and
regulations accumulate.

1672
01:14:52,859 --> 01:14:55,769
And if there's not some forcing function,

1673
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,100
like a war to clean up
the accumulation of laws

1674
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,190
and regulations, eventually,
everything becomes legal.

1675
01:15:02,189 --> 01:15:06,782
And that's like the
hardening of the arteries,

1676
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:11,099
or a way to think of it
is like being tied down

1677
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,860
by a million little
strings, like Gulliver.

1678
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:14,692
You can't move.

1679
01:15:14,693 --> 01:15:17,484
And it's not like any one of
those strings is the issue.

1680
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:19,260
You got a million of 'em.

1681
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:24,260
So there has to be a sort
of a garbage collection

1682
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:29,510
for laws and regulations so
that you don't keep accumulating

1683
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:32,699
laws and regulations to the point

1684
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,606
where you can't do anything.

1685
01:15:34,606 --> 01:15:36,869
This is why we can't build a
high-speed rail in America.

1686
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:37,710
It's illegal.

1687
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:38,582
That's the issue.

1688
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,939
It's illegal six ways to Sunday

1689
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:43,739
to build high-speed rail in America.

1690
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:46,920
- I wish you could just like, for a week,

1691
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,159
go into Washington and like
be the head of the committee

1692
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,396
for making, what is it?

1693
01:15:53,396 --> 01:15:55,739
For the garbage collection,
making government smaller,

1694
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:57,059
like removing stuff.

1695
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,920
- I have discussed with Trump the idea

1696
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,380
of a government deficiency commission.

1697
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,239
- Nice, yeah.

1698
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:08,162
- And I would be willing to
be part of that commission.

1699
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:10,549
- I wonder how hard that is.

1700
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,680
- The antibody reaction
would be very strong.

1701
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,789
- [Lex] Yeah.

1702
01:16:14,789 --> 01:16:17,912
- So you really have to,

1703
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,289
you're attacking the matrix at that point.

1704
01:16:22,289 --> 01:16:23,462
Matrix will fight back.

1705
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,773
- How are you doing with
that, being attacked?

1706
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,859
- Me, attacked?
- Yeah.

1707
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:32,859
There's a lot of it.

1708
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:35,492
- Yeah, there is a lot.

1709
01:16:36,449 --> 01:16:40,492
I mean, every day, I know psyop. (laughs)

1710
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:42,570
Where's my tinfoil hat?
- How do you keep

1711
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:44,219
your just positivity,

1712
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,510
optimism about the world,

1713
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,400
a clarity of thinking about the world,

1714
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,019
so just not become resentful

1715
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,240
or cynical or all that kind of stuff?

1716
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,072
Just getting attacked

1717
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:55,560
by a very large number of
people, misrepresented.

1718
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,590
- Oh yeah, that's a daily occurrence.

1719
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,422
- Yes.

1720
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:03,484
- I mean, it does get me down at times.

1721
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:05,372
I mean, it makes me sad, but,

1722
01:17:12,358 --> 01:17:15,606
I mean, at some point,
you have to sort of say,

1723
01:17:15,606 --> 01:17:17,760
"Look, the attacks are by people

1724
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,159
that actually don't know me.

1725
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,229
And they're trying to generate clicks."

1726
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:25,799
So if you can sort of detach
yourself somewhat emotionally,

1727
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,199
which is not easy and say, "Okay, look,

1728
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:32,760
this is not actually from
someone that knows me

1729
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,030
or they're literally just writing to get

1730
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,533
impressions and clicks,

1731
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:47,577
then I guess it doesn't hurt as much."

1732
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,009
It's not quite water off a duck's back.

1733
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:53,579
Maybe it's like acid off
a duck's back. (laughs)

1734
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:54,720
- All right, well, that's good.

1735
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,130
Just about your own life,

1736
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,680
what do you as a measure
of success in your life?

1737
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,383
- Measure of success, I'd say like,

1738
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:03,250
how many useful things can I get done?

1739
01:18:04,289 --> 01:18:07,529
- Day-to-day basis,
wake up in the morning,

1740
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:09,300
how can I be useful today?

1741
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,440
- Yeah.

1742
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:13,439
Maximize utility area out
of the code of usefulness.

1743
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,019
Very difficult to be useful at scale.

1744
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,040
- At scale.

1745
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:19,109
Can you like speak to what it takes

1746
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:21,420
to be useful for somebody like you,

1747
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,369
where there's so many amazing great teams?

1748
01:18:23,369 --> 01:18:26,369
Like how do you allocate your
time to be in the most useful?

1749
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,710
- Well, time is the true currency.

1750
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:32,819
- Yeah.

1751
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:36,792
- So it is tough to say what
is the best allocation of time.

1752
01:18:36,792 --> 01:18:41,792
I mean, there are often, say,

1753
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:43,859
if you could look at, say, Tesla,

1754
01:18:43,859 --> 01:18:45,539
I mean Tesla, this year,

1755
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:47,729
we'll do over a hundred
billion in revenue.

1756
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:49,352
So that's $2 billion a week.

1757
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,130
If I make slightly better decisions,

1758
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:57,123
I can affect the outcome
by a billion dollars.

1759
01:18:58,289 --> 01:19:03,289
So then I try to do the
best decisions I can

1760
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:08,670
and on balance, at least
compared to the competition.

1761
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:09,539
Pretty good decisions.

1762
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:14,539
But the marginal value
of a better decision

1763
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:17,190
can easily be in the course of an hour,

1764
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:18,659
a hundred million dollars.

1765
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:21,239
- Given that, how do you take risks?

1766
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:24,029
How do you do the algorithm
that you mentioned?

1767
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:26,699
I mean, deleting, given a small thing,

1768
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:28,859
can be a billion dollars.

1769
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:30,359
How do you decide to-
- Yeah.

1770
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:34,590
Well, I think you have to look
at it on a percentage basis

1771
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,206
because if you look at
it in absolute terms,

1772
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:39,485
it's just, I would never get any sleep.

1773
01:19:39,484 --> 01:19:42,149
It would just be like I
need to just keep working

1774
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:44,762
and work my brain harder.

1775
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:47,039
And I'm not trying to
get as much as possible

1776
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:48,693
out of this meat computer.

1777
01:19:49,949 --> 01:19:52,983
So it's pretty hard,

1778
01:19:53,909 --> 01:19:56,069
'cause you can just work all the time.

1779
01:19:56,069 --> 01:19:59,549
And at any given point, like I said,

1780
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:00,930
a slightly better decision

1781
01:20:00,930 --> 01:20:03,900
could be a hundred million dollar impact

1782
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:06,302
for Tesla or SpaceX for that matter.

1783
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:10,420
But it is wild when
considering the marginal value

1784
01:20:11,358 --> 01:20:13,619
of time can be a hundred million dollars

1785
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:16,082
an hour at times or more.

1786
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:21,332
- Is your own happiness part
of that equation of success?

1787
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:23,685
- It has to be, to some degree.

1788
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:27,092
If I'm sad, if I'm depressed,
I make worse decisions.

1789
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,520
So I can't have, like if I
have zero recreational time,

1790
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,710
then I make worse decisions.

1791
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:37,472
So I don't know a lot,
but it's above zero.

1792
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:40,320
I mean, my motivation,
if I've got a religion

1793
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:45,059
of any kind is a religion of curiosity,

1794
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,410
of trying to understand.

1795
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:48,899
It's really the mission of
Grok - understand the universe.

1796
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,414
I'm trying to understand the universe,

1797
01:20:51,414 --> 01:20:53,250
or let's at least set things in motion

1798
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:55,743
such that at some point,

1799
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:59,550
civilization understands the universe

1800
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:00,949
far better than we do today.

1801
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,650
And even what questions to ask.

1802
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:07,502
As Douglas Adams pointed out in his book,

1803
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,760
sometimes, the answer is
arguably the easy part.

1804
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,510
Trying to frame the question
correctly is the hard part.

1805
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,640
Once you frame the question correctly,

1806
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,373
the answer is often easy.

1807
01:21:21,569 --> 01:21:25,170
So I'm trying to set things in motion

1808
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:27,270
such that we are at least at some point

1809
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,870
able to understand the universe.

1810
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:35,420
So for SpaceX, the goal is
to make life multi-planetary.

1811
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,399
And which is if you go
to the foamy paradox

1812
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,050
of where are the aliens,

1813
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:49,560
you've got these sort of great filters.

1814
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,080
It's just like, why have we
not heard from the aliens?

1815
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:55,079
Now lot of people think
there are aliens among us.

1816
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:58,109
I often claim to be one,
which nobody believes me,

1817
01:21:58,109 --> 01:22:02,309
but I did say alien registration card

1818
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:06,093
at one point on my immigration documents.

1819
01:22:07,319 --> 01:22:09,809
So I've not seen any evidence of aliens.

1820
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,920
So it suggests that at least
one of the explanations

1821
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,922
is that intelligent
life is extremely rare.

1822
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,840
And again, if you look
at the history of earth,

1823
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,489
civilization has only been around

1824
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,630
for one millionth of earth's existence.

1825
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:31,289
So if aliens had visited here,

1826
01:22:31,289 --> 01:22:33,577
say, a hundred thousand years
ago, they would be like,

1827
01:22:33,577 --> 01:22:35,547
"Well, they don't even have writing."

1828
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:38,429
Just hunter-gatherers, basically.

1829
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,289
So how long does a civilization last?

1830
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:50,310
So for SpaceX, the goal is to establish

1831
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:53,250
a self-sustaining city on Mars.

1832
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,542
Mars is the only viable
planet for such a thing.

1833
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:01,500
The moon is close, but it lacks resources,

1834
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,460
and I think it's probably vulnerable

1835
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,943
to any calamity that takes out earth.

1836
01:23:09,869 --> 01:23:12,090
The moon is too close.

1837
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:14,640
It's vulnerable to a calamity
that takes out earth.

1838
01:23:16,529 --> 01:23:18,989
So I'm not saying we
shouldn't have a moon base,

1839
01:23:18,989 --> 01:23:22,082
but Mars would be far more resilient.

1840
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,990
The difficulty of getting to Mars

1841
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:26,340
is what makes it resilient.

1842
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,680
In going through these
various explanations

1843
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,453
of why don't we see the aliens,

1844
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:40,653
one of them is that they failed to pass

1845
01:23:40,653 --> 01:23:44,640
these great filters,

1846
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,093
these key hurdles.

1847
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:52,652
And one of those hurdles is
being a multi-planet species.

1848
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,530
So if you're a multi-planet species,

1849
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:57,359
then if something were to happen,

1850
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:00,539
whether that was a natural catastrophe

1851
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:03,420
or a manmade catastrophe,

1852
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,993
at least the other planet
would probably still be around.

1853
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:10,529
You don't have all the eggs in one basket.

1854
01:24:10,529 --> 01:24:13,019
And once you are sort
of a two-planet species,

1855
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,520
you can obviously extend,

1856
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,580
to extend life halves
to the asteroid belt,

1857
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:20,882
to maybe the moons of Jupiter and Saturn,

1858
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:24,869
and ultimately, to other star systems.

1859
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:27,069
But if you can't even
get to another planet,

1860
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,432
definitely not getting to star systems.

1861
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:31,893
- And the other possible great filters,

1862
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,840
super powerful technology
like AGI, for example.

1863
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,520
So you're basically trying to knock out

1864
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,393
one great filter at a time.

1865
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:48,690
- Digital super intelligence
is possibly a great filter.

1866
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,672
I hope it isn't, but it might be.

1867
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:54,842
Guys like say Geoff Hinton would say,

1868
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,320
he invented a number of the key principles

1869
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:00,509
in artificial intelligence.

1870
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,630
I think he puts the
probability of AI annihilation

1871
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:06,302
around 10 to 20%, something like that.

1872
01:25:11,586 --> 01:25:14,400
It's not like, you know,
look on the right side.

1873
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:17,982
It's 80% likely to be great. (laughs)

1874
01:25:19,676 --> 01:25:22,262
But I think AI risk
mitigation is important.

1875
01:25:23,609 --> 01:25:24,899
Being a multi-planet species

1876
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:27,629
would be a massive risk mitigation.

1877
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:32,430
And I do wanna sort of once
again emphasize the importance

1878
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:37,037
of having enough children
to sustain our numbers

1879
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:43,890
and not plummet into population collapse,

1880
01:25:43,890 --> 01:25:46,050
which is currently happening.

1881
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,449
Population collapse is a
real and current thing.

1882
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,589
So the only reason it's
not being reflected

1883
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:58,250
in the total population numbers as much

1884
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:00,050
is because people are living longer.

1885
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,309
It's easy to predict,
say, what the population

1886
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,760
of any given country will be.

1887
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:10,409
You just take the birth rate last year,

1888
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:13,559
how many babies were born,
multiply that by life expectancy,

1889
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,240
and that's what the population
will be a steady state

1890
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:18,869
unless if the birth rate
continues at that level.

1891
01:26:18,869 --> 01:26:21,390
But if it keeps declining,
it will be even less

1892
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:23,430
and eventually dwindle to nothing.

1893
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:28,430
So I keep banging on the
baby drum here for a reason,

1894
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,439
because it has been the source
of civilizational collapse

1895
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:33,812
over and over again throughout history.

1896
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:39,890
And so why don't we just not
try to stable for that day?

1897
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:45,569
- Well, in that way, I have
miserably failed civilization,

1898
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:48,462
and I'm trying, hoping to fix that.

1899
01:26:48,462 --> 01:26:50,159
I would love to have many kids.

1900
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,210
- Great, hope you do.

1901
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:55,073
No time like the present.

1902
01:26:55,073 --> 01:26:56,760
- (laughs) Yeah.

1903
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,463
I gotta allocate more
compute to the whole process.

1904
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,489
But apparently, it's not that difficult.

1905
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:04,382
- No, it's like unskilled labor.

1906
01:27:06,689 --> 01:27:10,979
- Well, one of the things you do for me,

1907
01:27:10,979 --> 01:27:12,750
for the world is to inspire us

1908
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,100
with what the future could be.

1909
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,230
And so some of the things
we've talked about,

1910
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:17,909
some of the things you're building,

1911
01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:21,479
alleviating human suffering with Neuralink

1912
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:24,539
and expanding the capabilities
of the human mind,

1913
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:26,552
trying to build a colony on Mars,

1914
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:32,969
so creating a backup for
humanity on another planet,

1915
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,030
and exploring the possibilities

1916
01:27:36,029 --> 01:27:38,519
of what artificial intelligence
could be in this world,

1917
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,040
especially in the real world AI,

1918
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:42,930
with hundreds of millions,

1919
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:45,600
maybe billions of robots walking around.

1920
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,890
- There will be billions of robots.

1921
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:48,600
That's seems almost,

1922
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,430
that seems virtual certainty.

1923
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:53,400
- Well, thank you for building the future,

1924
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:57,179
and thank you for inspiring
so many of us to keep building

1925
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,329
and creating cool stuff, including kids.

1926
01:28:00,329 --> 01:28:02,850
- You're welcome. (laughs)

1927
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,140
Go forth and multiply.

1928
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,180
- Go forth and multiply.

1929
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,012
Thank you, Elon.

1930
01:28:07,012 --> 01:28:08,640
Thanks for talking about it.

1931
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:12,420
Thanks for listening to this
conversation with Elon Musk.

1932
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,690
And now, dear friends, here's DJ Seo,

1933
01:28:15,689 --> 01:28:19,739
the co-founder, president,
and COO of Neuralink.

1934
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:21,989
When did you first become fascinated

1935
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:23,670
by the human brain?

1936
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:24,899
- For me, I was always interested

1937
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:28,289
in understanding the purpose of things

1938
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:33,090
and how it was engineered
to serve that purpose,

1939
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:36,600
whether it's organic or inorganic,

1940
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,400
like we were talking earlier
about your curtain holders.

1941
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:42,239
They serve a clear purpose

1942
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,789
and they were engineered
with that purpose in mind.

1943
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:51,029
And growing up, I had a lot
of interest in seeing things,

1944
01:28:51,989 --> 01:28:54,029
touching things, feeling things,

1945
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,889
and trying to really understand the root

1946
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:59,520
of how it was designed
to serve that purpose.

1947
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,790
And obviously, brain is
just a fascinating organ

1948
01:29:02,789 --> 01:29:04,019
that we all carry.

1949
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:08,730
It's infinitely powerful machine that has

1950
01:29:08,729 --> 01:29:10,709
intelligence and cognition
that arise from it.

1951
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:13,500
And we haven't even scratched the surface

1952
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,052
in terms of how all of that occurs.

1953
01:29:17,069 --> 01:29:19,739
But also at the same time,
I think it took me a while

1954
01:29:19,739 --> 01:29:22,319
to make that connection to really studying

1955
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:24,779
and building tech to understand the brain.

1956
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:26,609
Not until graduate school.

1957
01:29:26,609 --> 01:29:29,939
There were a couple moments,
key moments in my life

1958
01:29:29,939 --> 01:29:33,089
where some of those I think influenced

1959
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:38,090
how the trajectory of my
life got me to studying

1960
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,109
what I'm doing right now.

1961
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:43,799
One was growing up both
sides of my family.

1962
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:48,150
My grandparents had a very
severe form of Alzheimer,

1963
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:52,909
and it's incredibly
debilitating conditions.

1964
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,760
I mean, literally, you're
seeing someone's whole identity

1965
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,310
and their mind just losing over time.

1966
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:04,310
And I just remember thinking
how both the power of the mind,

1967
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:06,840
but also how something like that

1968
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,810
could really lose your sense of identity.

1969
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:12,270
- It's fascinating that
that is one of the ways

1970
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:13,680
to reveal the power of a thing

1971
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:17,940
by watching it lose the power.

1972
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:19,469
- Yeah, a lot of what
we know about the brain

1973
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:22,289
actually comes from these cases

1974
01:30:22,289 --> 01:30:25,199
where there are trauma to the brain

1975
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,250
or some parts of the brain

1976
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,250
that led someone to
lose certain abilities.

1977
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:33,210
And as a result, there's some correlation

1978
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:34,980
and understanding of
that part of the tissue

1979
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:37,019
being critical for that function.

1980
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:41,010
And it's an incredibly fragile organ,

1981
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:42,000
if you think about it that way.

1982
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,279
But also, it's incredibly plastic

1983
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:46,376
and incredibly resilient
in many different ways.

1984
01:30:46,377 --> 01:30:49,620
- And by the way, the term
plastic, as we'll use a bunch,

1985
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:52,739
means that it's adaptable.

1986
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,300
So neuroplasticity refers

1987
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,699
to the adaptability of the human brain.

1988
01:30:56,699 --> 01:30:58,319
- Correct.

1989
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:00,539
Another key moment that sort of influenced

1990
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:03,420
how the trajectory of my life have shaped

1991
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,359
towards the current focus of my life

1992
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:09,170
has been during my teenage
year when I came to the U.S.

1993
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:12,359
I didn't speak a word of English.

1994
01:31:12,359 --> 01:31:13,920
There was a huge language barrier,

1995
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,980
and there was a lot of struggle

1996
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:20,039
to kind of connect with
my peers around me,

1997
01:31:20,039 --> 01:31:23,489
because I didn't understand
the artificial construct

1998
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:25,349
that we have created called language,

1999
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:27,180
specifically English in this case.

2000
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:29,850
And I remember feeling pretty isolated,

2001
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:32,250
not being able to connect
with peers around me.

2002
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:35,039
So spent a lot of time just on my own,

2003
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:37,229
reading books, watching movies,

2004
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:41,159
and I naturally sort of
gravitated towards sci-fi books.

2005
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:43,500
I just found them really,
really interesting.

2006
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,470
And also, it was a great
way for me to learn English.

2007
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,659
Some of the first set of
books that I picked up

2008
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:51,989
are "Ender's Game," the whole saga

2009
01:31:51,989 --> 01:31:55,439
by Orson Scott card, and "Neuromancer"

2010
01:31:55,439 --> 01:32:00,119
from William Gibson, and "Snow
Crash" from Neal Stephenson.

2011
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:02,729
And movies like "Matrix" was coming out

2012
01:32:02,729 --> 01:32:05,099
around that time point
that really influenced

2013
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,620
how I think about the potential impact

2014
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:11,250
that technology can have
for our lives in general.

2015
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,829
So fast track to my college years,

2016
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:16,890
I was always fascinated
by just physical stuff,

2017
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:18,090
building physical stuff,

2018
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:21,090
and especially physical things

2019
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:23,819
that had some sort of intelligence.

2020
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:27,509
And I studied electrical
engineering during undergrad,

2021
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:31,079
and I started out my research in MEMS,

2022
01:32:31,079 --> 01:32:33,269
so micro-electro-mechanical systems,

2023
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,520
and really building
these tiny nanostructures

2024
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,410
for temperature sensing.

2025
01:32:37,409 --> 01:32:40,559
And I just found that to be
just incredibly rewarding

2026
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,960
and fascinating subject to just understand

2027
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:45,393
how you can build something
miniature like that

2028
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:48,420
that again served a
function and had a purpose.

2029
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:52,710
And then I spent large
majority of my college years

2030
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,739
basically building
millimeter wave circuits

2031
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:59,819
for next gen telecommunication
systems, for imaging.

2032
01:32:59,819 --> 01:33:01,799
And it was just something that I found

2033
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,230
very, very intellectually interesting.

2034
01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:07,799
Phase arrays, how the
signal processing works

2035
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:12,300
for any modern as well as next
gen telecommunication system,

2036
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,503
wireless and wireline.

2037
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:17,789
EM waves or electromagnetic
waves are fascinating.

2038
01:33:17,789 --> 01:33:21,569
How do you design antennas
that are most efficient

2039
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:23,759
in a small footprint that you have?

2040
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,039
How do you make these
things energy-efficient?

2041
01:33:26,039 --> 01:33:27,539
That was something that just consumed

2042
01:33:27,539 --> 01:33:29,670
my intellectual curiosity.

2043
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,980
And that journey led
me to actually apply to

2044
01:33:31,979 --> 01:33:35,789
and find myself at a PhD
program at UC Berkeley

2045
01:33:35,789 --> 01:33:37,890
at kind of this consortium called

2046
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,480
the Berkeley Wireless Research Center

2047
01:33:39,479 --> 01:33:42,329
that was precisely looking at building,

2048
01:33:42,329 --> 01:33:44,340
at the time, we called it xg,

2049
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:46,287
similar to 3G, 4G, 5G,

2050
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,350
but the next, next generation G system,

2051
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:51,750
and how you would design
circuits around that

2052
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,130
to ultimately go on phones

2053
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:55,949
and basically any other devices

2054
01:33:55,949 --> 01:33:58,409
that are wirelessly connected these days.

2055
01:33:58,409 --> 01:34:01,199
So I was just absolutely just fascinated

2056
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:03,386
by how that entire system works

2057
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:05,132
and that infrastructure works.

2058
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:10,590
And then also during grad
school, I had sort of the fortune

2059
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:14,279
of having couple research fellowships

2060
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:17,189
that led me to pursue
whatever project that I want.

2061
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:19,079
And that's one of the things that

2062
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:21,840
I really enjoyed about my
graduate school career,

2063
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,199
where you got to kind of pursue
your intellectual curiosity

2064
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,079
and the domain that may not
matter at the end of the day,

2065
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:31,409
but it's something that really allows you

2066
01:34:31,409 --> 01:34:34,649
the opportunity to go
as deeply as you want,

2067
01:34:34,649 --> 01:34:36,929
as well as as widely as you want.

2068
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:39,030
And at the time, I was actually
working on this project

2069
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:42,449
called the Smart Bandaid,
and the idea was that

2070
01:34:42,449 --> 01:34:44,909
when you get a wound,
there's a lot of other

2071
01:34:44,909 --> 01:34:48,149
kind of proliferation of signaling pathway

2072
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:51,000
that cells follow to close that wound.

2073
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,460
And there were hypotheses

2074
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,730
that when you apply
external electric field,

2075
01:34:56,729 --> 01:34:59,729
you can actually accelerate
the closing of that field

2076
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:04,019
by having basically
electro taxing of the cells

2077
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:06,090
around that wound site.

2078
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,520
And specifically, not
just for normal wound,

2079
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,830
there are chronic wounds that don't heal.

2080
01:35:10,829 --> 01:35:12,779
So we were interested in building

2081
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:17,039
some sort of wearable
patch that you could apply

2082
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,493
to kind of facilitate
that healing process.

2083
01:35:20,493 --> 01:35:22,829
And that was in collaboration

2084
01:35:22,829 --> 01:35:25,323
with Professor Michel Maharbiz,

2085
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:29,819
which was a great addition to
kind of my thesis committee

2086
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:33,539
and it really shaped the
rest of my PhD career.

2087
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:34,619
- So this would be the first time

2088
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:36,899
you interacted with biology, I suppose.

2089
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:37,920
- Correct, correct.

2090
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,730
I mean, there were some peripheral

2091
01:35:41,729 --> 01:35:44,579
end application of the wireless imaging

2092
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:46,350
and telecommunication
system that I was using

2093
01:35:46,350 --> 01:35:51,350
for security and bio imaging,
but this was a very clear

2094
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:56,220
direct application to
biology and biological system

2095
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:58,199
and understanding the
constraints around that

2096
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:01,050
and really designing and engineering

2097
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:02,610
electrical solutions around it.

2098
01:36:02,609 --> 01:36:04,649
So that was my first introduction,

2099
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:09,152
and that's also kind of how
I got introduced to Michel.

2100
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,700
He's sort of known for
remote control of beetles

2101
01:36:14,699 --> 01:36:16,920
in the early 2000s.

2102
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:21,920
And then around 2013, obviously
kind of the holy grail

2103
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:24,359
when it comes to implantable system

2104
01:36:24,359 --> 01:36:28,859
is to kind of understand how
small of a thing you can make,

2105
01:36:28,859 --> 01:36:32,369
and a lot of that is
driven by how much energy

2106
01:36:32,369 --> 01:36:34,349
or how much power you can supply to it

2107
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:36,660
and how you extract data from it.

2108
01:36:36,659 --> 01:36:40,920
So at the time at Berkeley,
there was kind of this desire

2109
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,029
to kind of understand in the neural space

2110
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:45,980
what sort of system you can build

2111
01:36:45,979 --> 01:36:48,869
to really miniaturize
these implantable systems.

2112
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:53,760
And I distinctively remember
this one particular meeting

2113
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,507
where Michel came in and he's like,

2114
01:36:55,506 --> 01:36:57,206
"Guys, I think I have a solution."

2115
01:36:58,319 --> 01:36:59,882
The solution is ultrasound.

2116
01:37:02,264 --> 01:37:04,230
And then he proceeded
to kind of walk through

2117
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:07,919
why that is the case, and
that really formed the basis

2118
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,210
for my thesis work
called neural dust system

2119
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:15,329
that was looking at ways to use ultrasound

2120
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:18,180
as opposed to electromagnetic waves

2121
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,730
for powering as well as communication.

2122
01:37:20,729 --> 01:37:22,409
I guess I should step back and say

2123
01:37:22,409 --> 01:37:27,122
the initial goal of the project
was to build these tiny,

2124
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:30,689
about a size of a neuron
implantable system

2125
01:37:30,689 --> 01:37:32,609
that can be parked next to a neuron,

2126
01:37:32,609 --> 01:37:34,409
being able to record its state

2127
01:37:34,409 --> 01:37:36,960
and being able to ping that
back to the outside world

2128
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,907
for doing something useful.

2129
01:37:38,907 --> 01:37:43,680
And as I mentioned, the size
of the implantable system

2130
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,619
is limited by how you power the thing

2131
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:48,539
and get the data off of it.

2132
01:37:48,539 --> 01:37:50,880
And at the end of the day, fundamentally,

2133
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,859
if you look at a human body,

2134
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:55,710
we're essentially a bag of salt water,

2135
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:57,810
with some interesting
proteins and chemicals,

2136
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:01,980
but it's mostly salt water
that's very, very well

2137
01:38:01,979 --> 01:38:04,772
temperature-regulated
at 37 degrees Celsius.

2138
01:38:05,939 --> 01:38:08,849
And we'll get into how, and later,

2139
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:11,070
why that's an extremely harsh environment

2140
01:38:11,069 --> 01:38:12,539
for any electronics to survive,

2141
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,039
as I'm sure you've experienced
or maybe not experienced

2142
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:20,130
dropping cell phone in a
salt water in an ocean.

2143
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:22,180
It will instantly kill the device, right?

2144
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:26,069
But anyways, just in general,

2145
01:38:26,069 --> 01:38:28,319
electromagnetic waves don't penetrate

2146
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:29,853
through this environment well.

2147
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,548
And just the speed of
light, it is what it is.

2148
01:38:34,547 --> 01:38:35,819
We can't change it.

2149
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:40,819
And based on the wavelength
at which you are interfacing

2150
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:44,833
with the device, the device
just needs to be big.

2151
01:38:44,832 --> 01:38:47,069
Like these inductors
needs to be quite big.

2152
01:38:47,069 --> 01:38:49,829
And the general good rule of thumb is that

2153
01:38:49,829 --> 01:38:53,460
you want the wavefront to
be roughly on the order

2154
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,159
of the size of the thing
that you're interfacing with.

2155
01:38:56,159 --> 01:39:00,630
So an implantable system that is around

2156
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,590
10 to 100 micron in dimension in a volume,

2157
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:05,940
which is about the size of a neuron

2158
01:39:05,939 --> 01:39:08,342
that you see in a human body,

2159
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:12,960
you would have to operate at
like hundreds of gigahertz,

2160
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,539
which number one, not only is it difficult

2161
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:18,840
to build electronics operating
at those frequencies,

2162
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,420
but also, the body just attenuates that

2163
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,760
very, very significantly.

2164
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,989
So the interesting kind of
insight of this ultrasound

2165
01:39:27,989 --> 01:39:31,739
was the fact that ultrasound just travels

2166
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:34,679
a lot more effectively
in the human body tissue

2167
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,960
compared to electromagnetic waves.

2168
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,212
And this is something that you encounter,

2169
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:42,720
and I'm sure most people have encountered

2170
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,170
in their lives when you go to hospitals

2171
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:50,703
that are medical ultrasound
sonograph, right?

2172
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:55,680
And they go into very, very deep depth

2173
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:58,560
without attenuating
too much of the signal.

2174
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,560
So all in all, ultrasound,
the fact that it travels

2175
01:40:03,989 --> 01:40:05,639
through the body extremely well

2176
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,250
and the mechanism to which
it travels to the body

2177
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:11,220
really well is that just the
wavefront is very different.

2178
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:15,210
Its electromagnetic waves are transverse,

2179
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,760
whereas ultrasound waves are compressive.

2180
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,560
So it's just a completely different mode

2181
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:23,520
of wavefront propagation,

2182
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,740
and as well as speed of sound

2183
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:30,029
is orders and orders of magnitude
less than speed of light,

2184
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:33,929
which means that even at 10
megahertz ultrasound wave,

2185
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:37,770
your wavefront ultimately is
a very, very small wavelength.

2186
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:39,960
So if you're talking about interfacing

2187
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,922
with the 10 micron or 100
micron type structure,

2188
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:49,350
you would have 150 micron
wavefront at 10 megahertz.

2189
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:52,320
And building electronics
at those frequencies

2190
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:53,340
are much, much, much easier

2191
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,380
and they're a lot more efficient.

2192
01:40:55,380 --> 01:41:00,380
So the basic idea kind of was
born out of using ultrasound

2193
01:41:01,710 --> 01:41:03,630
as a mechanism for powering the device,

2194
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:05,970
and then also getting data back.

2195
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:08,850
So now the question is, how
do you get the data back?

2196
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:10,440
The mechanism to which we landed on

2197
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:12,659
is what's called backscattering.

2198
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:16,170
This is actually something
that is very common

2199
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,659
and that we interface
on a day-to-day basis

2200
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:22,649
with our RFID cards, our
radio frequency ID tag,

2201
01:41:22,649 --> 01:41:27,649
where there's actually rarely,
in your ID, a battery inside.

2202
01:41:28,859 --> 01:41:32,639
There's an antenna and
there's some sort of coil

2203
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:37,079
that has your serial identification ID

2204
01:41:37,079 --> 01:41:38,279
and then there's an external device

2205
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:41,759
called a reader that
then sends a wavefront,

2206
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,010
and then you reflect back that wavefront

2207
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,710
with some sort of modulation
that's unique to your ID.

2208
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:50,640
That's what's called
backscattering, fundamentally.

2209
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,500
So the tag itself actually

2210
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,930
doesn't have to consume that much energy.

2211
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:58,560
And that was a mechanism to which we were

2212
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,180
kind of thinking about
sending the data back.

2213
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:04,260
So when you have an external
ultrasonic transducer

2214
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:07,470
that's sending ultrasonic
wave to your implant,

2215
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:09,000
the neuro dust implant,

2216
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,930
and it records some information
about its environment,

2217
01:42:12,930 --> 01:42:16,140
whether it's a neuron
firing or some other state

2218
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:21,140
of the tissue that it's interfacing with,

2219
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,329
and then it just amplitude modulates

2220
01:42:24,329 --> 01:42:27,210
the wavefront that comes
back to the source.

2221
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:29,819
- And the recording step
would be the only one

2222
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:31,380
that requires any energy?

2223
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,779
So what would require
energy in that low step?

2224
01:42:33,779 --> 01:42:37,529
- Correct, so it is that initial
kind of startup circuitry

2225
01:42:37,529 --> 01:42:40,139
to get that recording, amplifying it,

2226
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,570
and then just modulating.

2227
01:42:42,569 --> 01:42:46,039
And the mechanism that you can enable that

2228
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:48,269
is there is this specialized crystal

2229
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:52,500
called piezoelectric crystals
that are able to convert

2230
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,470
sound energy into electrical
energy and vice versa.

2231
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:58,170
So you can kind of have this interplay

2232
01:42:58,170 --> 01:42:59,970
between the ultrasonic domain

2233
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:02,972
and electrical domain that
is the biological tissue.

2234
01:43:04,109 --> 01:43:07,409
- So on the theme of parking very small

2235
01:43:07,409 --> 01:43:12,149
computational devices next
to neurons, that's the dream,

2236
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:14,460
the vision of brain computer interfaces.

2237
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:15,987
Maybe before we talk about Neuralink,

2238
01:43:15,987 --> 01:43:20,987
can you give a sense of the
history of the field of BCI?

2239
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:26,180
What has been maybe the continued dream,

2240
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:28,560
and also some of the
milestones along the way

2241
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,600
with the different approaches

2242
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:32,913
and the amazing work
done at the various labs?

2243
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:38,212
- I think a good starting
point is going back to 1790s.

2244
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,658
(Lex laughs)

2245
01:43:39,658 --> 01:43:41,190
- I did not expect that.

2246
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:46,189
- Where the concept of animal electricity

2247
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:48,449
or the fact that body is electric

2248
01:43:48,449 --> 01:43:51,929
was first discovered by Luigi Galvani,

2249
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:53,850
where he had this famous experiment

2250
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:57,930
where he connected set
of electrodes to frog leg

2251
01:43:57,930 --> 01:44:00,450
and ran current through it,
and then it started twitching,

2252
01:44:00,449 --> 01:44:04,079
and he said, "Oh my goodness,
the body's electric."

2253
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,920
So fast forward many, many years to 1920s

2254
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,550
where Hans Berger, who's
German psychiatrist

2255
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:15,180
discovered EEG or electroencephalography,

2256
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,356
which is still around.

2257
01:44:16,356 --> 01:44:19,470
There are these electrode
arrays that you wear

2258
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:21,720
outside the skull that gives you some

2259
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,250
sort of neural recording.

2260
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:24,930
That was a very, very big milestone

2261
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:27,960
that you can record
some sort of activities

2262
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:29,672
about the human mind.

2263
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:36,329
And then in the 1940s, there
were these group of scientists,

2264
01:44:36,329 --> 01:44:39,579
Renshaw, Forbes, and
Morrison that inserted

2265
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:45,420
these glass micro
electrodes into the cortex

2266
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,819
and recorded single neurons.

2267
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:50,520
The fact that there's signal

2268
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,347
that are a bit more high resolution

2269
01:44:52,346 --> 01:44:54,479
and high fidelity as you get closer

2270
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:55,729
to the source, let's say.

2271
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:01,079
And in the 1950s, these two scientists,

2272
01:45:01,079 --> 01:45:03,960
Hodgkin and Huxley showed up,

2273
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:07,649
and they built this
beautiful, beautiful models

2274
01:45:07,649 --> 01:45:10,920
of the cell membrane
and the ionic mechanism

2275
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,300
and had these like circuit diagram.

2276
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,610
And as someone who's an electric engineer,

2277
01:45:14,609 --> 01:45:18,420
it's a beautiful model that's
built out of these partial

2278
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,840
differential equations,
talking about flow of ions,

2279
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,890
and how that really leads
to how neurons communicate.

2280
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:27,510
And they won the Nobel Prize for that

2281
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:29,610
10 years later in the 1960s.

2282
01:45:29,609 --> 01:45:34,609
So in 1969, Eb Fetz from
University of Washington,

2283
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,510
published this beautiful paper called

2284
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:38,909
Operating Conditioning of
Cortical Unit Activity,

2285
01:45:38,909 --> 01:45:42,420
where he was able to record

2286
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,090
a single unit neuron from a monkey

2287
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:49,800
and was able to have the monkey modulated

2288
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,409
based on its activity and reward system.

2289
01:45:52,409 --> 01:45:56,340
So I would say this is the
very, very first example,

2290
01:45:56,340 --> 01:45:59,140
as far as I'm aware, of as closed loop

2291
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:01,980
brain computer interface or BCI.

2292
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:05,099
- The abstract reads, "The
activity of single neurons

2293
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:09,300
in precentral cortex
of anesthetized monkeys

2294
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,730
was conditioned by reinforcing high rates

2295
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:15,209
of neuronal discharge with
delivery of a food pellet.

2296
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:18,270
Auditory and visual feedback
of unit firing rates

2297
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:21,270
was usually provided in
addition to food reinforcement."

2298
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:24,690
Cool, so they actually got it done.

2299
01:46:24,689 --> 01:46:25,522
- They got it done.

2300
01:46:25,523 --> 01:46:28,502
This is back in 1969.

2301
01:46:30,157 --> 01:46:31,949
- "After several training sessions,

2302
01:46:31,949 --> 01:46:35,010
monkeys could increase the
activity of newly isolated cells

2303
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:40,010
by 50 to 500% above rates
before reinforcement."

2304
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:41,939
Fascinating.

2305
01:46:41,939 --> 01:46:43,606
- Brain is very plastic.

2306
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:44,489
(Lex laughs)

2307
01:46:44,489 --> 01:46:48,273
- And so from here, the
number of experiments grew.

2308
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:52,260
- Yeah, number of experiments
as well as set of tools

2309
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:54,722
to interface with the
brain have just exploded.

2310
01:46:56,279 --> 01:46:59,849
I think, and also, just
understanding the neural code

2311
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:01,980
and how some of the cortical layers

2312
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:03,809
and the functions are organized.

2313
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:08,810
So the other paper that is pretty seminal,

2314
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,960
especially in the the motor decoding

2315
01:47:11,909 --> 01:47:15,699
was this paper in the
1980s from Georgopoulos

2316
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:19,289
that discovered that
there's this thing called

2317
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:20,609
motor tuning curve.

2318
01:47:20,609 --> 01:47:22,529
So what are motor tuning curves?

2319
01:47:22,529 --> 01:47:24,599
It's the fact that there are neurons

2320
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:28,500
in the motor cortex of
mammals, including humans,

2321
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:32,819
that have a preferential direction
that causes them to fire.

2322
01:47:32,819 --> 01:47:34,739
So what that means is
there are a set of neurons

2323
01:47:34,739 --> 01:47:38,189
that would increase
their spiking activities

2324
01:47:38,189 --> 01:47:41,429
when you're thinking
about moving to the left,

2325
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:46,430
right, up, down, and any of those vectors.

2326
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:49,829
And based on that, you
could start to think,

2327
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:53,939
well, if you can't identify
those essential eigenvectors,

2328
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:55,649
you can do a lot, and you can actually use

2329
01:47:55,649 --> 01:47:57,599
that information for actually decoding

2330
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,510
someone's intended
movement from the cortex.

2331
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:03,820
So that was a very, very seminal
kind of paper that showed

2332
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:10,230
that there is some sort
of code you can extract,

2333
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:11,819
especially in the motor cortex.

2334
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:13,409
- So there's signal there.

2335
01:48:13,409 --> 01:48:17,369
And if you measure the
electrical signal from the brain,

2336
01:48:17,369 --> 01:48:20,849
that you could actually figure
out what the intention was.

2337
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:22,740
- Correct, yeah, not
only electrical signals,

2338
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:25,199
but electrical signals from
the right set of neurons

2339
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,479
that give you these
preferential direction.

2340
01:48:27,479 --> 01:48:29,099
- Hmm.

2341
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,520
Okay, so going slowly towards Neuralink,

2342
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:35,010
one interesting question
is what do we understand

2343
01:48:35,010 --> 01:48:39,329
on the BCI front on invasive
versus non-invasive?

2344
01:48:39,329 --> 01:48:43,960
From this line of work,
how important is it

2345
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,640
to park next to the neuron?

2346
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:49,530
What does that get you?

2347
01:48:49,529 --> 01:48:51,059
- That answer fundamentally depends

2348
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:53,280
on what you want to do with it, right?

2349
01:48:53,279 --> 01:48:55,920
There's actually incredible
amount of stuff that you can do

2350
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,640
with EEG and electrocardiograph, ECoG,

2351
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,079
which actually doesn't penetrate

2352
01:49:01,079 --> 01:49:03,869
the cortical layer or parenchyma,

2353
01:49:03,869 --> 01:49:05,760
but you place a set of electrodes

2354
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,920
on the surface of the brain.

2355
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,619
So the thing that I'm
personally very interested in

2356
01:49:10,619 --> 01:49:15,619
is just actually understanding
and being able to just really

2357
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:20,039
tap into the high
resolution, high fidelity

2358
01:49:20,039 --> 01:49:21,269
understanding of the activities

2359
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:23,190
that are happening at the local level.

2360
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:26,250
And we can get into biophysics,

2361
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:29,939
but just to kind of step
back to kind of use analogy,

2362
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:31,529
'cause analogy here can be useful,

2363
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:32,759
and sometimes, it's a little bit difficult

2364
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,320
to think about electricity.

2365
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:35,909
At the end of the day, we're
doing electrical recording

2366
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:39,239
that's mediated by ionic currents,

2367
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,880
movements of these charged particles,

2368
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,020
which is really, really hard

2369
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:44,570
for most people to think about.

2370
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,039
But turns out, a lot of the activities

2371
01:49:49,979 --> 01:49:51,809
that are happening in the brain

2372
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:54,180
and the frequency bandwidth,
which starts happening

2373
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:56,460
is actually very, very
similar to sound waves,

2374
01:49:56,460 --> 01:50:01,109
and in our normal
conversation, audible range.

2375
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:04,862
So the analogy that typically
is used in the field is,

2376
01:50:05,898 --> 01:50:07,953
if you have a football stadium,

2377
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:10,589
there's game going on.

2378
01:50:10,590 --> 01:50:11,940
If you stand outside the stadium,

2379
01:50:11,939 --> 01:50:14,460
you maybe get a sense
of how the game is going

2380
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,739
based on the cheers and the
booze of the home crowd,

2381
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:18,809
whether the team is winning or not.

2382
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:21,480
But you have absolutely
no idea what the score is.

2383
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:26,159
You have absolutely no idea
what individual audience

2384
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:28,739
or the players are talking
or saying to each other,

2385
01:50:28,739 --> 01:50:30,989
what the next play is,
what the next goal is.

2386
01:50:32,279 --> 01:50:34,800
So what you have to do is you
have to drop the microphone

2387
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,579
near into the stadium and
then get near the source,

2388
01:50:38,579 --> 01:50:41,159
like into the individual chatter.

2389
01:50:41,159 --> 01:50:43,889
In this specific example,
you would wanna have it

2390
01:50:43,890 --> 01:50:46,896
right next to where
the huddle's happening.

2391
01:50:46,896 --> 01:50:50,189
So I think that's kind
of a good illustration

2392
01:50:50,189 --> 01:50:52,109
of what we're trying to do

2393
01:50:52,109 --> 01:50:55,469
when we say invasive or minimally invasive

2394
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,780
or implanted brain computer interfaces

2395
01:50:57,779 --> 01:51:02,130
versus non-invasive or
non-implanted brain interfaces.

2396
01:51:02,130 --> 01:51:03,930
It's basically talking about

2397
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:05,340
where do you put that microphone,

2398
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:07,467
and what can you do with that information.

2399
01:51:07,467 --> 01:51:11,430
- So what is the biophysics
of the read and write

2400
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:13,740
communication that we're
talking about here,

2401
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:18,239
as we now step into the
efforts at Neuralink?

2402
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,800
- Yeah, so brain is made up

2403
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,920
of these specialized cells called neurons.

2404
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,489
There's billions of
them, tens of billions.

2405
01:51:29,489 --> 01:51:31,679
Sometimes, people call
it a hundred billion

2406
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:36,680
that are connected in this
complex yet dynamic network

2407
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:39,750
that are constantly remodeling.

2408
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:42,180
They're changing their synaptic weights,

2409
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:45,842
and that's what we typically
call neuroplasticity.

2410
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:51,539
And the neurons are also bathed
in this charged environment

2411
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:55,079
that is latent with
many charged molecules,

2412
01:51:55,079 --> 01:51:59,399
like potassium ions,
sodium ions, chlorine ions.

2413
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:04,049
And those actually facilitate
these through ionic current,

2414
01:52:04,050 --> 01:52:06,422
communication between
these different networks.

2415
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:11,283
And when you look at a neuron as well,

2416
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:17,149
they have these membrane
with a beautiful, beautiful

2417
01:52:17,819 --> 01:52:21,420
protein structure called the
voltage selective ion channels,

2418
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:26,420
which, in my opinion, is one
of nature's best inventions.

2419
01:52:26,970 --> 01:52:29,070
In many ways, if you
think about what they are,

2420
01:52:29,069 --> 01:52:32,670
they're doing the job of
a modern day transistors.

2421
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:34,680
Transistors are nothing
more, at the end of the day,

2422
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,980
than a voltage-gated conduction channel.

2423
01:52:37,979 --> 01:52:40,029
And nature found a way to have that

2424
01:52:40,029 --> 01:52:43,229
very, very early on in its evolution.

2425
01:52:43,229 --> 01:52:45,539
And as we all know, with the transistor,

2426
01:52:45,539 --> 01:52:47,340
you can have many, many computation

2427
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:51,930
and a lot of amazing things
that we have access to today.

2428
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:56,190
So I think it's one of
those, just as a tangent,

2429
01:52:56,189 --> 01:52:58,679
just a beautiful, beautiful invention

2430
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,789
that the nature came up with,

2431
01:52:59,789 --> 01:53:01,882
these voltage-gated ion channels.

2432
01:53:01,882 --> 01:53:05,220
- I mean, I suppose there's,
on the biological level,

2433
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:07,949
every level of the
complexity of the hierarchy

2434
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:11,639
of the organism, there's
going to be some mechanisms

2435
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,579
for storing information
and for doing computation.

2436
01:53:14,579 --> 01:53:16,949
And this is just one such way.

2437
01:53:16,949 --> 01:53:19,470
But to do that with biological

2438
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:21,480
and chemical components is interesting.

2439
01:53:21,479 --> 01:53:25,649
Plus like when neurons, I mean,
it's not just electricity,

2440
01:53:25,649 --> 01:53:29,219
it's chemical communication,
it's also mechanical.

2441
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:33,877
I mean, these are like
actual objects that vibrate.

2442
01:53:34,979 --> 01:53:36,209
I mean, they move-

2443
01:53:36,210 --> 01:53:37,132
- Yeah, they're actually,

2444
01:53:37,132 --> 01:53:40,619
I mean, there's a lot of really,
really interesting physics

2445
01:53:40,619 --> 01:53:42,449
that are involved in, you know,

2446
01:53:42,449 --> 01:53:46,289
kind of going back to
my work on ultrasound

2447
01:53:46,289 --> 01:53:49,890
during grad school, there are groups,

2448
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:52,740
and there were groups,
and there are still groups

2449
01:53:52,739 --> 01:53:57,409
looking at ways to cause
neurons to actually fire

2450
01:53:57,409 --> 01:53:59,399
an action potential using ultrasound wave.

2451
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:01,484
And the mechanism to
which that's happening

2452
01:54:01,484 --> 01:54:03,603
is still unclear as I understand.

2453
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,449
It may just be that you're imparting

2454
01:54:06,449 --> 01:54:08,970
some sort of thermal energy
and that causes cells

2455
01:54:08,970 --> 01:54:11,490
to depolarize in some interesting ways.

2456
01:54:11,489 --> 01:54:14,550
But there are also these ion channels

2457
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:18,239
or even membranes that
actually just open up its pore

2458
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:20,969
as there are being
mechanically shook, right?

2459
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:21,802
Vibrated.

2460
01:54:21,802 --> 01:54:24,659
So there's just a lot of elements

2461
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:27,752
of these like move particles, which again,

2462
01:54:27,752 --> 01:54:30,899
like that's governed by
diffusion physics, right?

2463
01:54:30,899 --> 01:54:32,339
Movements of particles.

2464
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:35,640
And there's also a lot of kind
of interesting physics there.

2465
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:39,660
- Also, not to mention, as
Roger Penrose talks about,

2466
01:54:39,659 --> 01:54:42,149
there might be some beautiful weirdness

2467
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:44,277
in the quantum mechanical
effects of all of this.

2468
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:46,649
And he actually believes
that consciousness

2469
01:54:46,649 --> 01:54:49,799
might emerge from the quantum
mechanical effects there.

2470
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:53,039
So like there's physics, there's
chemistry, there's biology,

2471
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:54,600
all of that is going on there.

2472
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:55,432
- Oh yeah, yeah.

2473
01:54:55,432 --> 01:54:57,420
I mean, you can, yes,

2474
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:00,989
there's a lot of levels of
physics that you can dive into.

2475
01:55:00,989 --> 01:55:04,439
But yeah, in the end,
you have these membranes

2476
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:07,829
with these voltage-gated ion
channels that selectively

2477
01:55:07,829 --> 01:55:10,260
let these charge molecules

2478
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:14,672
that are in the extracellular
matrix like in and out.

2479
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:18,870
And these neurons generally

2480
01:55:18,869 --> 01:55:20,489
have these like resting potential

2481
01:55:20,489 --> 01:55:22,649
where there's a voltage difference

2482
01:55:22,649 --> 01:55:25,289
between inside the cell
and outside the cell.

2483
01:55:25,289 --> 01:55:30,289
And when there's some sort
of stimuli that changes

2484
01:55:32,279 --> 01:55:34,469
the state such that they
need to send information

2485
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:39,300
to the downstream network,
you start to kind of see

2486
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,710
these like sort of orchestration

2487
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:42,359
of these different molecules

2488
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:44,130
going in and out of these channels.

2489
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,079
They also open up, like
more of them open up

2490
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:48,420
once it reaches some threshold

2491
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:51,300
to a point where you
have a depolarizing cell

2492
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,430
that sends action potential.

2493
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:55,200
So it's a just a very beautiful

2494
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:59,130
kind of orchestration of these molecules.

2495
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:04,130
And what we're trying to do
when we place an electrode

2496
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:06,389
or parking it next to a neuron

2497
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:08,250
is that you're trying to measure

2498
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:11,222
these local changes in the potential.

2499
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:17,130
Again, mediated by the
movements of the ions.

2500
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:19,319
And what's interesting,
as I mentioned earlier,

2501
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:21,019
there's a lot of physics involved.

2502
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:24,359
And the two dominant physics

2503
01:56:24,359 --> 01:56:27,929
for this electrical recording domain

2504
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:31,050
is diffusion physics and electromagnetism.

2505
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,840
And where one dominates,

2506
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,150
where Maxwell's equation dominates

2507
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:39,359
versus fixed law dominates depends on

2508
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:41,222
where your electrode is.

2509
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:47,359
If it's close to the source,
mostly electromagnetic-based,

2510
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:51,600
when you're farther away from
it, it's more diffusion-based.

2511
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:55,590
So essentially, when you're
able to park it next to it,

2512
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:59,310
you can listen in on
those individual chatter

2513
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:01,500
and those local changes in the potential,

2514
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,390
and the type of signal that you get

2515
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:07,653
are these canonical textbook
neural spiking waveform.

2516
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:10,229
The moment you're further away,

2517
01:57:10,229 --> 01:57:13,439
and based on some of the
studies that people have done,

2518
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:16,319
Christof Koch's lab and others,

2519
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:17,939
once you're away from that source

2520
01:57:17,939 --> 01:57:20,039
by roughly around a hundred micron,

2521
01:57:20,039 --> 01:57:22,109
which is about a width of a human hair,

2522
01:57:22,109 --> 01:57:24,269
you no longer hear from that neuron.

2523
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:27,630
Or you're no longer able
to kind of have the system

2524
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:31,359
sensitive enough to be able
to record that particular

2525
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:36,779
local membrane potential
change in that neuron.

2526
01:57:36,779 --> 01:57:39,509
And just to kind of give
you a sense of scale also,

2527
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,640
when you look at a hundred micron voxel,

2528
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,079
so a hundred micron by a hundred micron

2529
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:45,960
by a hundred micron box in a brain tissue,

2530
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,079
there's roughly around 40 neurons

2531
01:57:49,079 --> 01:57:51,449
and whatever number of
connections that they have.

2532
01:57:51,449 --> 01:57:54,059
So there's a lot in that volume of tissue.

2533
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:55,920
So the moment you're outside of that,

2534
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,420
there's just no hope that you'll be able

2535
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:01,170
to detect that change from
that one specific neuron

2536
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:03,600
that you may care about.

2537
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,693
- Yeah, but as you're
moving about this space,

2538
01:58:07,739 --> 01:58:09,179
you'll be hearing other ones.

2539
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:11,310
So if you move another 100 micron,

2540
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:12,210
you'll be hearing chatter

2541
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:14,130
from another community.
- Correct.

2542
01:58:14,130 --> 01:58:17,039
- And so the whole
sense is you wanna place

2543
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:18,765
as many as possible electrodes

2544
01:58:18,765 --> 01:58:20,460
and then you're listening to the chatter.

2545
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,869
- Yeah, you wanna listen to the chatter.

2546
01:58:21,869 --> 01:58:24,269
And at the end of the day, you also want

2547
01:58:24,270 --> 01:58:28,200
to basically let the software
do the job of decoding.

2548
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:32,069
And just to kind of go to,

2549
01:58:32,069 --> 01:58:35,880
why ECOG and EEG work at all, right?

2550
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:39,180
When you have these
local changes, obviously,

2551
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:41,880
it's not just this one
neuron that's activating.

2552
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:43,560
There's many, many other networks

2553
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:45,510
that are activating all the time.

2554
01:58:45,510 --> 01:58:48,239
And you do see sort of a general change

2555
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:52,859
in the potential of this
electro, like this charge medium,

2556
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:54,622
and that's what you're recording
when you're farther away.

2557
01:58:54,622 --> 01:58:57,029
I mean, you still have
some reference electrode

2558
01:58:57,029 --> 01:59:01,319
that's stable in the brain
that's just electroactive organ,

2559
01:59:01,319 --> 01:59:04,500
and you're seeing some
combination aggregate

2560
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:06,962
action potential changes and
then you can pick it up, right?

2561
01:59:06,962 --> 01:59:11,729
It's a much slower changing signals.

2562
01:59:11,729 --> 01:59:15,479
But there are these like canonical

2563
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:16,949
kind of oscillations and waves,

2564
01:59:16,949 --> 01:59:18,329
like gamma waves, beta waves.

2565
01:59:18,329 --> 01:59:20,550
Like when you sleep, that can be detected,

2566
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:22,779
'cause there's sort of a synchronized

2567
01:59:23,939 --> 01:59:28,562
kind of global effect of the
brain that you can detect.

2568
01:59:30,090 --> 01:59:32,552
And I mean, the physics of this go,

2569
01:59:32,551 --> 01:59:34,469
I mean, if we really wanna
go down that rabbit hole,

2570
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:38,190
like there's a lot that
goes on in terms of

2571
01:59:38,189 --> 01:59:41,279
like why diffusion physics
at some point dominates

2572
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:43,739
when you're further away from the source.

2573
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:45,809
It's just a charged medium.

2574
01:59:45,810 --> 01:59:48,750
So similar to how when you
have electromagnetic ways

2575
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,159
propagating in atmosphere

2576
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:52,800
or in a charged medium like a plasma,

2577
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:56,220
there's this weird shielding
that happens that actually

2578
01:59:56,220 --> 02:00:00,360
further attenuates the signal
as you move away from it.

2579
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:02,472
So yeah, you see, like if you do

2580
02:00:02,472 --> 02:00:03,720
a really, really deep dive

2581
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:07,289
on kind of the signal
attenuation over distance,

2582
02:00:07,289 --> 02:00:09,449
you start to see kind
of one of where square

2583
02:00:09,449 --> 02:00:11,789
in the beginning, and
then exponential drop off.

2584
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:14,579
And that's the knee at which you go from

2585
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:16,619
electromagnet magnetism dominating

2586
02:00:16,619 --> 02:00:19,439
to diffusion physics dominating.

2587
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:24,269
- But once again, with the
electrodes, the biophysics,

2588
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:27,870
you need to understand it's not as deep,

2589
02:00:27,869 --> 02:00:29,550
because no matter where
you're placing that,

2590
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:32,279
you're listening to a small
crowd of local neurons.

2591
02:00:32,279 --> 02:00:33,112
- Correct, yeah.

2592
02:00:33,113 --> 02:00:35,039
So once you penetrate the brain,

2593
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:37,229
you're in the arena, so to speak.

2594
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:39,029
- And there's a lot of neurons.

2595
02:00:39,029 --> 02:00:40,079
- [DJ] There are many, many of 'em.

2596
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:42,899
- But then again, there's a
whole field of neuroscience

2597
02:00:42,899 --> 02:00:46,559
that's studying like how
the different groupings,

2598
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:49,050
the different sections of
the seating in the arena,

2599
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:50,820
what they usually are responsible for,

2600
02:00:50,819 --> 02:00:53,340
which is where the metaphor
probably falls apart,

2601
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,279
'cause the seating is not
that organized in an arena.

2602
02:00:56,279 --> 02:00:57,960
- Also, most of them are silent.

2603
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,313
They don't really do much,

2604
02:01:00,899 --> 02:01:03,272
or their activities are, you know,

2605
02:01:04,404 --> 02:01:07,170
you have to hit it with just
the right set of stimulus.

2606
02:01:07,170 --> 02:01:08,970
- So they're usually quiet.

2607
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,530
- They're usually very quiet.

2608
02:01:10,529 --> 02:01:13,380
There's, I mean, similar to
dark energy and dark matter,

2609
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,180
there's dark neurons.

2610
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,590
What are they all doing?

2611
02:01:16,590 --> 02:01:18,180
When you place these electrode, again,

2612
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:20,070
like within this a hundred micron volume,

2613
02:01:20,069 --> 02:01:21,362
you have 40 or so neurons.

2614
02:01:21,363 --> 02:01:23,550
Like why do you not see 40 neurons?

2615
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:24,930
Why do you see only a handful?

2616
02:01:24,930 --> 02:01:25,829
What is happening there?

2617
02:01:25,829 --> 02:01:27,000
- Well, they're mostly quiet,

2618
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,149
but like when they speak, they
say profound shit, I think.

2619
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:31,889
That's the way I'd like to think about it.

2620
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:35,610
Anyway, before we zoom in
even more, let's zoom out.

2621
02:01:35,609 --> 02:01:38,909
So how does Neuralink work?

2622
02:01:38,909 --> 02:01:43,909
From the surgery to the implant

2623
02:01:44,369 --> 02:01:47,670
to the signal and the decoding process

2624
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:52,440
and the human being
able to use the implant

2625
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:56,429
to actually affect the world outside?

2626
02:01:56,430 --> 02:02:00,090
And all of this, I'm asking in the context

2627
02:02:00,090 --> 02:02:03,569
of there's a gigantic historic
milestone in Neuralink

2628
02:02:03,569 --> 02:02:07,079
just accomplished in January of this year,

2629
02:02:07,079 --> 02:02:08,340
putting a Neuralink implant

2630
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:11,190
in the first human being, Noland.

2631
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:13,859
And there's been a lot to talk about there

2632
02:02:13,859 --> 02:02:16,739
about his experience,
because he's able to describe

2633
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:18,119
all the nuance and the beauty

2634
02:02:18,119 --> 02:02:21,180
and the fascinating
complexity of that experience

2635
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:22,200
of everything involved.

2636
02:02:22,199 --> 02:02:26,039
But on the technical level,
how does Neuralink work?

2637
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:27,960
- Yeah, so there are
three major components

2638
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:29,579
to the technology that we're building.

2639
02:02:29,579 --> 02:02:33,809
One is the device, the thing
that's actually recording

2640
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:35,193
these neural chatters.

2641
02:02:36,119 --> 02:02:40,229
We call it N1 implant or The Link.

2642
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:43,500
And we have a surgical robot

2643
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,420
that's actually doing an implantation

2644
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:48,210
of these tiny, tiny wires
that we call threads

2645
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:51,210
that are smaller than human hair.

2646
02:02:51,210 --> 02:02:54,869
And once everything is surgirized,

2647
02:02:54,869 --> 02:02:56,909
you have these neural signals,

2648
02:02:56,909 --> 02:02:59,729
these spiking neurons that
are coming out of the brain

2649
02:02:59,729 --> 02:03:03,989
and you need to have some
sort of software to decode

2650
02:03:03,989 --> 02:03:06,872
what the users intend to do with that.

2651
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:10,439
So there's what's called
the Neuralink application,

2652
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:12,719
or B1 app that's doing that translation,

2653
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:17,159
is running the very, very
simple machine learning model

2654
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:22,159
that decodes these inputs
that are neural signals

2655
02:03:22,170 --> 02:03:25,000
and then convert it to a
set of outputs that allows

2656
02:03:26,069 --> 02:03:28,409
our participant, first participant Noland,

2657
02:03:28,409 --> 02:03:30,449
to be able to control a cursor on this.

2658
02:03:30,449 --> 02:03:33,809
- And this is done wirelessly?

2659
02:03:33,810 --> 02:03:34,980
- And this is done wirelessly.

2660
02:03:34,979 --> 02:03:39,149
So our implant is actually a two-part.

2661
02:03:39,149 --> 02:03:44,149
The link has these flexible
tiny wires called threads

2662
02:03:44,609 --> 02:03:49,609
that have multiple
electrodes along its length.

2663
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:53,850
And they're only inserted
into the cortical layer,

2664
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:57,310
which is about three to five
millimeters in a human brain

2665
02:03:58,170 --> 02:03:59,369
in the motor cortex region.

2666
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:04,079
That's where the kind of the
intention for movement lies in.

2667
02:04:04,079 --> 02:04:06,689
And we have 64 of these threads,

2668
02:04:06,689 --> 02:04:09,599
each thread having 16 electrodes along

2669
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,240
the span of three to four millimeters,

2670
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:13,559
separated by 200 microns.

2671
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:18,390
So you can actually record along
the depth of the insertion.

2672
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:23,390
And based on that signal,
there's custom integrated circuit

2673
02:04:25,979 --> 02:04:29,279
or ASIC that we built that
amplifies the neural signals

2674
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:32,219
that you're recording
and then digitizing it

2675
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:37,220
and then has some mechanism for detecting

2676
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:39,360
whether there was an interesting event

2677
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:43,289
that is a spiking event
and decide to send that,

2678
02:04:43,289 --> 02:04:46,529
or not send that through
Bluetooth to an external device,

2679
02:04:46,529 --> 02:04:48,449
whether it's a phone or a computer

2680
02:04:48,449 --> 02:04:50,159
that's running this Neuralink application.

2681
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:52,349
- So there's onboard
signal processing already

2682
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:55,200
just to decide whether this is
an interesting event or not.

2683
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:58,380
So there is some computational
power on board inside

2684
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,060
in addition to the human brain?

2685
02:05:00,060 --> 02:05:02,310
- Yeah, so it does the signal processing

2686
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:04,830
to kind of really compress
the amount of signal

2687
02:05:04,829 --> 02:05:05,909
that you're recording.

2688
02:05:05,909 --> 02:05:08,769
So we have a total of
a thousand electrodes

2689
02:05:09,659 --> 02:05:14,309
sampling at just under 20
kilohertz with 10 bit each.

2690
02:05:14,310 --> 02:05:17,313
So that's 200 megabits.

2691
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:21,000
That's coming through to the chip,

2692
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,380
from thousand channel
simultaneous neural recording.

2693
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,779
And that's quite a bit of data.

2694
02:05:27,779 --> 02:05:29,909
And there are technology available

2695
02:05:29,909 --> 02:05:31,649
to send that off wirelessly,

2696
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:35,939
but being able to do that
in a very, very thermally

2697
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:37,619
constrained environment that is a brain,

2698
02:05:37,619 --> 02:05:41,279
so there has to be some amount
of compression that happens

2699
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:43,949
to send off only the
interesting data that you need,

2700
02:05:43,949 --> 02:05:45,510
which in this particular case,

2701
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:50,310
for motor decoding is
occurrence of a spike or not.

2702
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:52,570
And then being able to use that

2703
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,750
to decode the intended cursor movement.

2704
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:00,630
So the implant itself processes it,

2705
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:03,060
figures out whether a
spike happened or not

2706
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,850
with our spike detection algorithm,

2707
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,950
and then sends it off, packages it,

2708
02:06:07,949 --> 02:06:12,179
sends it off through Bluetooth
to an external device

2709
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:14,670
that then has the model to decode,

2710
02:06:14,670 --> 02:06:17,432
okay, based on the spiking inputs,

2711
02:06:18,449 --> 02:06:21,449
did Noland wish to go
up, down, left, right,

2712
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:23,849
or click, or right click, or whatever?

2713
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:25,289
- All of this is really fascinating,

2714
02:06:25,289 --> 02:06:27,239
but let's stick on the N1 implant itself,

2715
02:06:27,239 --> 02:06:29,550
so the thing that's in the brain.

2716
02:06:29,550 --> 02:06:32,350
So I'm looking at a picture
of it, there's an enclosure,

2717
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:34,230
there's a charging call,

2718
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:38,252
so we didn't talk about the
charging, which is fascinating.

2719
02:06:39,689 --> 02:06:42,542
The battery, the power
electronics, the antenna.

2720
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,650
Then there's the signal
processing electronics.

2721
02:06:46,649 --> 02:06:48,000
I wonder if there's more kinds

2722
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,439
of signal processing you can do.

2723
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:50,939
That's another question.

2724
02:06:50,939 --> 02:06:53,199
And then there's the threads themselves

2725
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:56,489
with the enclosure on the bottom.

2726
02:06:56,489 --> 02:06:59,762
So maybe to ask about the charging,

2727
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:02,850
so there's a external charging device.

2728
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:05,400
- Mm-hmm, yeah, there's an
external charging device.

2729
02:07:05,399 --> 02:07:07,619
So yeah, the second part of the implant,

2730
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,300
the threads are the ones, again,

2731
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:12,930
just the last three to five
millimeters are the ones

2732
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:15,182
that are actually penetrating the cortex.

2733
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,119
Rest of it is,

2734
02:07:18,119 --> 02:07:21,510
actually, most of the volume
is occupied by the battery,

2735
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:22,623
rechargeable battery.

2736
02:07:23,909 --> 02:07:26,609
And it's about a size of a quarter.

2737
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:28,079
I actually have a device here,

2738
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:29,630
if you wanna take a look at it.

2739
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:34,980
This is the flexible
threat component of it.

2740
02:07:34,979 --> 02:07:36,782
And then this is the implant.

2741
02:07:38,939 --> 02:07:41,129
So it's about a size of a U.S. quarter.

2742
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:43,710
It's about nine millimeter thick.

2743
02:07:43,710 --> 02:07:45,750
So basically, this implant,

2744
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:48,872
once you have the craniectomy
and the directomy,

2745
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,449
threads are inserted,

2746
02:07:51,449 --> 02:07:55,979
and the hole that you
created, this craniectomy,

2747
02:07:55,979 --> 02:07:57,269
gets replaced with that.

2748
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:59,730
So basically, that thing plugs that hole,

2749
02:07:59,729 --> 02:08:03,359
and you can screw in these self-drilling

2750
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:06,722
cranial screws to hold it in place.

2751
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,920
And at the end of the day, once
you have the skin flap over,

2752
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,500
there's only about two
to three millimeters.

2753
02:08:13,500 --> 02:08:15,989
That's obviously transitioning

2754
02:08:15,989 --> 02:08:19,019
off of the top of the implant
to where the screws are.

2755
02:08:19,020 --> 02:08:22,470
And that's the minor bump that you have.

2756
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:24,813
- Those threads look tiny.

2757
02:08:26,010 --> 02:08:27,239
That's incredible.

2758
02:08:27,239 --> 02:08:28,802
That is really incredible.

2759
02:08:29,644 --> 02:08:31,110
That is really incredible.

2760
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:32,549
And also, you're right,

2761
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:35,699
most of the actual volume is the battery.

2762
02:08:35,699 --> 02:08:38,279
Yeah, this is way smaller than I realized.

2763
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:41,159
- They are also, the threads
themselves are quite strong.

2764
02:08:41,159 --> 02:08:42,840
- They look strong.

2765
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:46,739
- And the thread themselves
also has a very interesting

2766
02:08:46,739 --> 02:08:48,989
feature at the end of it called the loop.

2767
02:08:48,989 --> 02:08:51,359
And that's the mechanism
to which the robot

2768
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:53,159
is able to interface and manipulate

2769
02:08:53,159 --> 02:08:55,769
this tiny hair-like structure.

2770
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:58,530
- And they're tiny, so
what's the width of a thread?

2771
02:08:58,529 --> 02:09:03,529
- Yeah, so the width of a
thread starts from 16 micron

2772
02:09:03,689 --> 02:09:06,539
and then tapers out to about 84 micron.

2773
02:09:06,539 --> 02:09:11,012
So average human hair is about
80 to 100 micron in width.

2774
02:09:13,470 --> 02:09:14,789
- This thing is amazing.

2775
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:15,932
This thing is amazing.

2776
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,610
- Yes, most of the volume
is occupied by the battery,

2777
02:09:20,609 --> 02:09:22,832
rechargeable lithium ion cell.

2778
02:09:24,095 --> 02:09:28,500
And the charging is done
through inductive charging,

2779
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,229
which is actually very commonly used.

2780
02:09:31,229 --> 02:09:32,579
Most cell phones have that.

2781
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:36,376
The biggest difference is that for us,

2782
02:09:37,949 --> 02:09:39,059
usually when you have a phone

2783
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:40,770
and you wanna charge it on a charging pad,

2784
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:43,110
you don't really care how hot it gets,

2785
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:44,699
whereas for us, it matters.

2786
02:09:44,699 --> 02:09:46,139
There's a very strict regulation

2787
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:48,660
and good reasons to not actually increase

2788
02:09:48,659 --> 02:09:51,750
the surrounding tissue temperature
by two degrees Celsius.

2789
02:09:51,750 --> 02:09:55,079
So there's actually a lot of innovation

2790
02:09:55,079 --> 02:09:59,640
that is packed into this to allow charging

2791
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:01,680
of this implant without causing

2792
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:03,720
that temperature threshold to reach.

2793
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:07,050
And even small things like,
you see this charging coil

2794
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:09,329
and what's called the
ferrite shield, right?

2795
02:10:09,329 --> 02:10:11,939
So without that ferrite shield,

2796
02:10:11,939 --> 02:10:14,609
what you end up having
when you have resonant

2797
02:10:14,609 --> 02:10:17,579
inductive charging is
that the battery itself

2798
02:10:17,579 --> 02:10:22,289
is a metallic can, and you
form these Eddy currents

2799
02:10:22,289 --> 02:10:25,989
from external charger
and that causes heating

2800
02:10:26,939 --> 02:10:30,812
and that actually contributes
to inefficiency in charging.

2801
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,880
So this ferrite shield, what
it does is that it actually

2802
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:40,170
concentrate that field
line away from the battery

2803
02:10:40,170 --> 02:10:42,899
and then around the coil that's
actually wrapped around it.

2804
02:10:42,899 --> 02:10:46,259
- There's a lot of really
fascinating design here

2805
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:49,380
to make it, I mean, you're
integrating a computer

2806
02:10:49,380 --> 02:10:52,659
into a complex biological system.

2807
02:10:52,659 --> 02:10:54,539
- Yeah, there's a lot of innovation here.

2808
02:10:54,539 --> 02:10:57,420
I would say that part of what enabled this

2809
02:10:57,420 --> 02:11:01,319
was just the innovations in the wearable.

2810
02:11:01,319 --> 02:11:04,529
There's a lot of really, really powerful,

2811
02:11:04,529 --> 02:11:09,529
tiny, low power microcontrollers,
temperature sensors,

2812
02:11:09,899 --> 02:11:14,039
or various different sensors
and power electronics.

2813
02:11:14,039 --> 02:11:17,640
A lot of innovation really came
in the charging coil design,

2814
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:21,240
how this is packaged, and
how do you enable charging

2815
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:24,840
such that you don't really
exceed that temperature limit,

2816
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:28,079
which is not a constraint
for other devices out there.

2817
02:11:28,079 --> 02:11:29,789
- So let's talk about
the threads themselves,

2818
02:11:29,789 --> 02:11:31,649
those tiny, tiny, tiny things.

2819
02:11:31,649 --> 02:11:34,619
So how many of them are there?

2820
02:11:34,619 --> 02:11:37,260
You mentioned a thousand electrodes.

2821
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:38,640
How many threads are there,

2822
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:41,970
and what did the electrodes
have to do with the threads?

2823
02:11:41,970 --> 02:11:44,280
- Yeah, so the current instantiation

2824
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:47,099
of the device has 64 threads,

2825
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:51,000
and each thread has 16 electrodes

2826
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,670
for a total of 1,024 electrodes

2827
02:11:53,670 --> 02:11:56,823
that are capable of both
recording and stimulating.

2828
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:03,500
And the thread is basically
this polymer insulated wire.

2829
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:11,460
The metal conductor is
the kind of tiramisu cake

2830
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:14,792
of ti, plat, gold, plate, ti.

2831
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:19,443
And they're very, very tiny wires.

2832
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:24,593
Two micron in width, so
2/1000000th of meter.

2833
02:12:25,739 --> 02:12:27,960
- It's crazy that that
thing I'm looking at

2834
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:31,230
has the polymer installation,
has the conducting material,

2835
02:12:31,229 --> 02:12:34,379
and has 16 electrodes at the end of it.

2836
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:35,789
- On each of those threads.

2837
02:12:35,789 --> 02:12:36,779
- Yeah, on each of those threads.

2838
02:12:36,779 --> 02:12:38,519
- Correct.
- 16, each one of those.

2839
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:40,913
- You're not gonna be able
to see it with naked eyes.

2840
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:44,160
- And I mean, to state the obvious,

2841
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:45,840
or maybe for people
who are just listening,

2842
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,640
they're flexible.

2843
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:49,980
- Yes, yes, that's also one element

2844
02:12:49,979 --> 02:12:52,799
that was incredibly important for us.

2845
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,949
So each of these thread
are, as I mentioned,

2846
02:12:55,949 --> 02:12:59,729
16 micron in width and then
they taper to 84 micron,

2847
02:12:59,729 --> 02:13:02,882
but in thickness, they're
less than five micron.

2848
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:08,850
And thickness is mostly
polyamide at the bottom

2849
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:11,910
and this metal track and
then another polyamide.

2850
02:13:11,909 --> 02:13:13,856
So two micron of polyamide,

2851
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:17,070
400 nanometer of this metal stack,

2852
02:13:17,069 --> 02:13:19,799
and two micron of polyamide
sandwiched together

2853
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:21,630
to protect it from the environment

2854
02:13:21,630 --> 02:13:25,890
that is 37 degrees C bag of salt water.

2855
02:13:25,890 --> 02:13:28,289
- So what's some, maybe
can you speak to some

2856
02:13:28,289 --> 02:13:31,319
interesting aspects of
the material design here?

2857
02:13:31,319 --> 02:13:34,739
Like what does it take to
design a thing like this

2858
02:13:34,739 --> 02:13:37,619
and to be able to
manufacture a thing like this

2859
02:13:37,619 --> 02:13:40,349
for people who don't know
anything about this kind of thing?

2860
02:13:40,350 --> 02:13:43,950
- Yeah, so the material
selection that we have is not,

2861
02:13:43,949 --> 02:13:46,592
I don't think it was particularly unique.

2862
02:13:47,489 --> 02:13:50,789
There were other labs
and there are other labs

2863
02:13:50,789 --> 02:13:55,619
that are kind of looking
at similar material stack.

2864
02:13:55,619 --> 02:13:57,989
There's kind of a fundamental question

2865
02:13:57,989 --> 02:14:01,649
and still needs to be
answered around the longevity

2866
02:14:01,649 --> 02:14:06,269
and reliability of these
micro electrodes that we call,

2867
02:14:06,270 --> 02:14:09,090
compared to some of the
other more conventional,

2868
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:12,449
neural interfaces, devices
that are intracranial.

2869
02:14:12,449 --> 02:14:16,349
So penetrating the cortex
that are more rigid,

2870
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:17,350
like the Utah array.

2871
02:14:18,748 --> 02:14:20,789
There are these four by four millimeter

2872
02:14:20,789 --> 02:14:24,180
kind of silicon shank that have exposed

2873
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:25,780
recording site at the end of it.

2874
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:29,880
And that's been kind of the innovation

2875
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:33,270
from Richard Normann back in 1997.

2876
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:34,103
It's called the Utah Array

2877
02:14:34,103 --> 02:14:36,300
'cause he was at University of Utah.

2878
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:38,460
- And what does the Utah array look like?

2879
02:14:38,460 --> 02:14:40,770
So it's a rigid type of-

2880
02:14:40,770 --> 02:14:42,670
- Yeah, so we can actually look it up.

2881
02:14:44,729 --> 02:14:46,487
- Oh.
- Yeah.

2882
02:14:46,488 --> 02:14:48,329
(Lex laughing)

2883
02:14:48,329 --> 02:14:50,130
Yeah, so it's a bed of needle.

2884
02:14:50,130 --> 02:14:51,262
There's-
- (laughs) Yeah.

2885
02:14:52,829 --> 02:14:53,850
Okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.

2886
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:56,100
- So those are rigid-
- Rigid, yeah.

2887
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:56,932
You weren't kidding.

2888
02:14:56,932 --> 02:14:59,340
- And the size and the
number of shanks vary,

2889
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:02,297
anywhere from 64 to 128.

2890
02:15:03,689 --> 02:15:05,879
At the very tip of it
is an exposed electrode

2891
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,920
that actually records neural signal.

2892
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,529
The other thing that's
interesting to note is that

2893
02:15:10,529 --> 02:15:14,159
unlike Neuralink threads that
have recording electrodes

2894
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:17,430
that are actually exposed
iridium oxide recording sites

2895
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:20,610
along the depth, this is
only at a single depth.

2896
02:15:20,609 --> 02:15:23,069
So these Utah array spokes can be anywhere

2897
02:15:23,069 --> 02:15:26,309
between 0.5 millimeters to 1.5 millimeter.

2898
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:29,430
And they also have
designs that are slanted.

2899
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:31,780
So you can have it inserted
at different depth,

2900
02:15:33,090 --> 02:15:35,460
but that's one of the
other big differences.

2901
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:39,000
And then, I mean, the main key
difference is the fact that

2902
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,470
there's no active electronics.

2903
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:41,789
These are just electrodes,

2904
02:15:41,789 --> 02:15:44,550
and then there's a bundle of
a wire that you're seeing,

2905
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:47,710
and then that actually
then exits the craniectomy

2906
02:15:49,079 --> 02:15:51,989
that then has this port
that you can connect to

2907
02:15:51,989 --> 02:15:53,819
for any external electronic devices.

2908
02:15:53,819 --> 02:15:57,750
They are working on a or have
the wireless telemetry device,

2909
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:01,770
but it still requires
a through the skin port

2910
02:16:01,770 --> 02:16:04,260
that actually is one of
the biggest failure modes

2911
02:16:04,260 --> 02:16:06,690
for infection for the system.

2912
02:16:06,689 --> 02:16:09,210
- What are some of the challenges

2913
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:12,029
associated with flexible threads?

2914
02:16:12,029 --> 02:16:14,579
Like for example, on the robotic side,

2915
02:16:14,579 --> 02:16:19,579
R1, implanting those threads,
how difficult does that task?

2916
02:16:19,739 --> 02:16:21,840
- Yeah, so as you mentioned,

2917
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,110
they're very, very difficult
to maneuver by hand.

2918
02:16:25,109 --> 02:16:28,199
These Utah arrays that you saw earlier,

2919
02:16:28,199 --> 02:16:31,199
they're actually inserted
by a neurosurgeon

2920
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:33,719
actually positioning it near
the site that they want.

2921
02:16:33,719 --> 02:16:37,439
And then there's a pneumatic hammer

2922
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:39,540
that actually pushes them in.

2923
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:43,470
So it's a pretty simple process,

2924
02:16:43,469 --> 02:16:45,329
and they're easy to maneuver.

2925
02:16:45,329 --> 02:16:48,478
But for these thin film arrays,

2926
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:50,909
they're very, very tiny and flexible.

2927
02:16:50,909 --> 02:16:52,649
So they're very difficult to maneuver.

2928
02:16:52,649 --> 02:16:55,949
So that's why we built an
entire robot to do that.

2929
02:16:55,950 --> 02:16:58,533
There are other reasons
for why we built a robot,

2930
02:16:59,459 --> 02:17:01,979
and that is ultimately,
we want this to help

2931
02:17:01,979 --> 02:17:04,379
millions and millions of people
that can benefit from this.

2932
02:17:04,379 --> 02:17:07,179
And there just aren't that
many neurosurgeons out there.

2933
02:17:08,250 --> 02:17:13,250
And robots can be something that

2934
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:15,843
we hope can actually do
large parts of the surgery.

2935
02:17:17,639 --> 02:17:22,639
But yeah, the robot is this
entire other sort of category

2936
02:17:23,549 --> 02:17:26,099
of product that we're working on.

2937
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:31,100
And it's essentially this
multi-axis gantry system

2938
02:17:32,850 --> 02:17:36,510
that has the specialized robot head

2939
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:39,239
that has all of the optics

2940
02:17:39,239 --> 02:17:44,190
and this kind of a needle
retracting mechanism

2941
02:17:44,190 --> 02:17:49,020
that maneuvers these threads
via this loop structure

2942
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,340
that you have on the thread.

2943
02:17:52,340 --> 02:17:54,180
- So the thread already
has a loop structure

2944
02:17:54,180 --> 02:17:55,470
by which you can grab it?

2945
02:17:55,469 --> 02:17:56,639
- Correct, correct.
- Okay.

2946
02:17:56,639 --> 02:17:57,472
So this is fascinating.

2947
02:17:57,472 --> 02:18:01,520
So you mentioned optics,
so there's a robot - R1.

2948
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:06,030
So for now, there's a
human that actually creates

2949
02:18:06,030 --> 02:18:08,370
a hole in the skull.
- Mm-hmm.

2950
02:18:08,370 --> 02:18:13,110
- And then after that, there's
a computer vision component

2951
02:18:13,110 --> 02:18:16,893
that's finding a way to
avoid the blood vessels.

2952
02:18:17,969 --> 02:18:19,529
And then you're grabbing it by the loop,

2953
02:18:19,530 --> 02:18:22,470
each individual thread and placing it

2954
02:18:22,469 --> 02:18:25,260
in a particular location
to avoid the blood vessels.

2955
02:18:25,260 --> 02:18:27,510
And also choosing the depth of placement,

2956
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:28,343
all that?
- Correct.

2957
02:18:28,343 --> 02:18:29,176
So controlling every,

2958
02:18:29,175 --> 02:18:31,559
like the 3D geometry of the placement?

2959
02:18:31,559 --> 02:18:32,399
- Correct.

2960
02:18:32,399 --> 02:18:34,799
So the aspect of this robot that is unique

2961
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:38,609
is that it's not surgeon-assisted
or human-assisted.

2962
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:43,230
It's a semi-automatic or automatic robot.

2963
02:18:43,229 --> 02:18:45,000
Obviously, there are
human component to it,

2964
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,040
when you're placing targets.

2965
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:48,450
You can always move it away

2966
02:18:48,450 --> 02:18:51,750
from kind of major vessels that you see.

2967
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:54,719
But I mean, we wanna get
to a point where one click

2968
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:57,569
and it just does the
surgery within minutes.

2969
02:18:57,569 --> 02:19:02,039
- So the computer vision
component finds great targets,

2970
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:05,056
candidates and the human
kind of approves them

2971
02:19:05,056 --> 02:19:06,090
and the robot does,

2972
02:19:06,090 --> 02:19:07,469
does it do like one thread at a time

2973
02:19:07,469 --> 02:19:08,459
or does it do one-
- It does one thread

2974
02:19:08,459 --> 02:19:10,829
at a time, and that's
actually also one thing

2975
02:19:10,829 --> 02:19:14,579
that we are looking at ways

2976
02:19:14,579 --> 02:19:16,289
to do multiple threads at a time.

2977
02:19:16,290 --> 02:19:17,520
There's nothing stopping from it.

2978
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:21,483
You can have multiple kind
of engagement mechanisms,

2979
02:19:22,379 --> 02:19:24,179
but right now, it's one by one.

2980
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:27,630
And we also still do quite a bit

2981
02:19:27,629 --> 02:19:29,489
of just kind of verification

2982
02:19:29,489 --> 02:19:30,780
to make sure that it got inserted.

2983
02:19:30,780 --> 02:19:32,040
If so, how deep?

2984
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:34,263
Did it actually match
what was programmed in

2985
02:19:34,263 --> 02:19:36,030
and so on and so forth?

2986
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:38,670
- And the actual electrode
is a place that vary

2987
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:42,872
at differing depths in the like, I mean,

2988
02:19:42,872 --> 02:19:45,180
it's very small differences,
but differences.

2989
02:19:45,180 --> 02:19:46,500
- [DJ] Yeah, yeah.

2990
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:49,829
- And so that there's some
reasoning behind that,

2991
02:19:49,829 --> 02:19:50,663
as you mentioned.

2992
02:19:50,663 --> 02:19:54,993
Like it gets more varied signal.

2993
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:59,220
- Yeah, I mean, we try to place them all

2994
02:19:59,219 --> 02:20:03,779
around three or four
millimeter from the surface,

2995
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:06,150
just 'cause the span of the electrode,

2996
02:20:06,149 --> 02:20:09,389
those 16 electrodes that we
currently have in this version

2997
02:20:09,389 --> 02:20:13,049
spans roughly around three millimeters.

2998
02:20:13,049 --> 02:20:15,149
So we wanna get all of those in the brain.

2999
02:20:16,358 --> 02:20:17,191
- This is fascinating.

3000
02:20:17,191 --> 02:20:19,200
Okay, so there's a million questions here.

3001
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,503
If we could zoom in
specifically on the electrodes,

3002
02:20:21,503 --> 02:20:23,340
so what is your sense,

3003
02:20:23,340 --> 02:20:27,030
how many neurons is each
individual electrode listening to?

3004
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:29,370
- Yeah, each electrode
can record from anywhere

3005
02:20:29,370 --> 02:20:34,200
between 0 to 40, as I
mentioned, right, earlier.

3006
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:39,200
But tactically speaking,
we only see about,

3007
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:41,520
at most, like two to three.

3008
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,069
And you can actually
distinguish which neuron

3009
02:20:44,069 --> 02:20:47,933
it's coming from by the
shape of the spikes.

3010
02:20:47,933 --> 02:20:49,309
- [Lex] Oh, cool.

3011
02:20:49,309 --> 02:20:52,799
- So I mentioned the spike
detection algorithm that we have.

3012
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:55,143
It's called BOSS algorithm,

3013
02:20:56,459 --> 02:20:58,529
buffer online, spike sorter.

3014
02:20:58,530 --> 02:20:59,363
- Nice.

3015
02:20:59,362 --> 02:21:01,920
- It actually outputs
at the end of the day

3016
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:06,920
six unique values, which
are kind of the amplitude

3017
02:21:07,469 --> 02:21:10,799
of these like negative
going hump, middle hump,

3018
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:12,869
like positive going hump,

3019
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:15,270
and then also the time
at which these happen.

3020
02:21:15,270 --> 02:21:17,850
And from that, you can have a kind of

3021
02:21:17,850 --> 02:21:21,500
a statistical probability
estimation of, is that a spike?

3022
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:22,333
Is it not a spike?

3023
02:21:22,333 --> 02:21:24,690
And then based on that,
you could also determine,

3024
02:21:24,690 --> 02:21:26,550
oh, that spike looks
different than that spike.

3025
02:21:26,549 --> 02:21:28,049
Must have come from a different neuron.

3026
02:21:28,049 --> 02:21:31,889
- Okay, so that's a nice
signal processing step

3027
02:21:31,889 --> 02:21:34,649
from which you can then
make much better predictions

3028
02:21:34,649 --> 02:21:35,760
about if there's a spike.
- Yeah.

3029
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,079
- Especially in this kind of context

3030
02:21:37,079 --> 02:21:39,722
where there could be
multiple neurons screaming.

3031
02:21:41,129 --> 02:21:43,379
And that also results in you being able

3032
02:21:43,379 --> 02:21:45,809
to compress the data
better in the (indistinct).

3033
02:21:45,809 --> 02:21:47,153
Okay.
- And just to be clear,

3034
02:21:47,153 --> 02:21:51,899
I mean, the labs do what's
called spike sorting.

3035
02:21:51,899 --> 02:21:55,143
Usually, once you have
these like broadband,

3036
02:21:56,280 --> 02:21:57,989
the fully digitized signals

3037
02:21:57,989 --> 02:22:01,049
and then you run a bunch of different set

3038
02:22:01,049 --> 02:22:03,269
of algorithms to kind of tease apart,

3039
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:06,840
it's just all of this for
us is done on the device.

3040
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:09,149
- On the device.
- In a very low power,

3041
02:22:09,149 --> 02:22:14,149
custom built ASIC digital processing unit.

3042
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,720
- [Lex] Highly heat constrained?

3043
02:22:15,719 --> 02:22:16,829
- Highly heat constrained,

3044
02:22:16,829 --> 02:22:20,129
and the processing time
from signal going in

3045
02:22:20,129 --> 02:22:22,679
and giving you the output
is less than a microsecond,

3046
02:22:22,680 --> 02:22:25,500
which is a very, very
short amount of time.

3047
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:26,670
- Oh yeah, so the latency

3048
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:28,500
has to be super short.
- Correct.

3049
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:29,670
- Oh wow.

3050
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:30,960
Oh, that's a pain in the ass.

3051
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:33,479
- Yeah, latency is this huge, huge thing

3052
02:22:33,479 --> 02:22:34,680
that you have to deal with.

3053
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:36,690
Right now, the biggest source of latency

3054
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:37,940
comes from the Bluetooth,

3055
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,500
the way in which they're packetized

3056
02:22:40,500 --> 02:22:43,200
and we bend them in 15 millisecond.

3057
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,360
- Oh, interesting, it says
communication constraint.

3058
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,010
Is there some potential innovation there

3059
02:22:47,010 --> 02:22:48,329
on the protocol used?

3060
02:22:48,329 --> 02:22:49,709
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

3061
02:22:49,709 --> 02:22:52,229
- Yeah, Bluetooth is definitely not

3062
02:22:52,229 --> 02:22:57,229
our final wireless communication protocol

3063
02:22:57,569 --> 02:22:59,219
that we wanna get to.

3064
02:22:59,219 --> 02:23:01,769
- Hence the N1 and the R1.

3065
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:03,334
I imagine that increases-

3066
02:23:03,334 --> 02:23:04,983
- NxRx.

3067
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:09,076
- Yeah, that's the communication protocol,

3068
02:23:09,076 --> 02:23:12,809
'cause Bluetooth allows you to communicate

3069
02:23:12,809 --> 02:23:14,352
I guess farther distances
than you need to,

3070
02:23:14,352 --> 02:23:16,079
so you can go much shorter.

3071
02:23:16,079 --> 02:23:18,389
- Yeah, well, the primary motivation

3072
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:20,002
for choosing Bluetooth is that,

3073
02:23:20,003 --> 02:23:21,900
I mean, everything has Bluetooth.

3074
02:23:21,899 --> 02:23:23,430
- All right, you can talk to any device.

3075
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:26,970
- Interoperability is
just absolutely essential,

3076
02:23:26,969 --> 02:23:29,159
especially in this early phase.

3077
02:23:29,159 --> 02:23:32,069
And in many ways, if
you can access a phone

3078
02:23:32,069 --> 02:23:33,819
or a computer, you can do anything.

3079
02:23:35,459 --> 02:23:36,719
- Well, it'll be interesting to step back

3080
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:38,879
and actually look at, again,

3081
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:41,849
the same pipeline that
you mentioned for Noland.

3082
02:23:41,850 --> 02:23:46,260
So what does this whole process look like?

3083
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:51,260
From finding and selecting a
human being to the surgery,

3084
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:55,052
to the first time he's
able to use this thing?

3085
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,770
- So we have what's called
the patient registry

3086
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:03,479
that people can sign up to
hear more about the updates.

3087
02:24:03,479 --> 02:24:07,139
And that was a route to
which Noland applied.

3088
02:24:07,139 --> 02:24:10,799
And the process is that once
the application comes in,

3089
02:24:10,799 --> 02:24:13,170
it contains some medical records,

3090
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:18,000
and based on their medical eligibility,

3091
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,559
that there's a lot of different

3092
02:24:19,559 --> 02:24:22,109
inclusion-exclusion
criteria for them to meet.

3093
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:25,079
And we go through a
prescreening interview process

3094
02:24:25,079 --> 02:24:26,909
with someone from Neuralink.

3095
02:24:26,909 --> 02:24:30,239
And at some point, we
also go out to their homes

3096
02:24:30,239 --> 02:24:33,209
to do a BCI home audit,

3097
02:24:33,209 --> 02:24:36,059
'cause one of the most
kind of revolutionary part

3098
02:24:36,059 --> 02:24:40,289
about having this N1 system
that is completely wireless

3099
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:41,610
is that you can use it at home.

3100
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:44,250
Like you don't actually
have to go to the lab

3101
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:47,850
and go to the clinic to get connecterized

3102
02:24:47,850 --> 02:24:49,229
to these like specialized equipment

3103
02:24:49,229 --> 02:24:51,119
that you can't take home with you.

3104
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:54,270
So that's one of the key elements

3105
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:56,489
of when we're designing the system

3106
02:24:56,489 --> 02:24:57,449
that we wanted to keep in mind,

3107
02:24:57,450 --> 02:25:01,409
like people hopefully would
wanna be able to use this

3108
02:25:01,409 --> 02:25:03,959
every day in the comfort of their homes.

3109
02:25:03,959 --> 02:25:07,439
And so part of our engagement

3110
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:09,989
and what we're looking
for during BCI home audit

3111
02:25:09,989 --> 02:25:12,090
is to just kind of
understand their situation,

3112
02:25:12,090 --> 02:25:14,250
what other assistive
technology that they use.

3113
02:25:14,250 --> 02:25:17,909
- And we should also step
back and kind of say that

3114
02:25:17,909 --> 02:25:22,350
the estimate is 180,000
people live with quadriplegia

3115
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:24,390
in the United States, and each year,

3116
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:29,389
an additional 18,000 suffer a
paralyzing spinal cord injury.

3117
02:25:29,790 --> 02:25:34,620
So these are folks who
have a lot of challenges,

3118
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:38,370
living a life in terms of accessibility,

3119
02:25:38,370 --> 02:25:40,530
in terms of doing the
things that many of us

3120
02:25:40,530 --> 02:25:42,030
just take for granted day to day.

3121
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:45,210
And one of the things, one
of the goals of this initial

3122
02:25:45,209 --> 02:25:50,209
study is to enable them to
have sort of digital autonomy,

3123
02:25:50,549 --> 02:25:53,549
where they by themselves can
interact with a digital device

3124
02:25:53,549 --> 02:25:55,170
using just their mind,

3125
02:25:55,170 --> 02:25:57,000
something that you're calling telepathy.

3126
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,000
So digital telepathy, where a
quadriplegic can communicate

3127
02:26:02,069 --> 02:26:03,449
with a digital device

3128
02:26:03,450 --> 02:26:05,663
in all the ways that
we've been talking about.

3129
02:26:07,049 --> 02:26:09,989
Control the mouse cursor,

3130
02:26:09,989 --> 02:26:11,760
enough to be able to
do all kinds of stuff,

3131
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:14,880
including play games and tweet
and all that kind of stuff.

3132
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:17,519
And there's a lot of people for whom life,

3133
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:20,253
the basics of life are difficult,

3134
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:24,003
because of the things that
have happened to them.

3135
02:26:24,840 --> 02:26:29,489
- Yeah, I mean, movement is so
fundamental to our existence.

3136
02:26:29,489 --> 02:26:33,270
I mean, even speaking involves movement

3137
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:36,090
of mouth, lip, larynx.

3138
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:41,090
And without that, it's
extremely debilitating.

3139
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:46,050
And there are many, many
people that we can help.

3140
02:26:46,049 --> 02:26:49,289
And I mean, like especially if you start

3141
02:26:49,290 --> 02:26:53,250
to kind of look at other
forms of movement disorders

3142
02:26:53,250 --> 02:26:54,840
that are not just from spinal cord injury,

3143
02:26:54,840 --> 02:26:59,840
but from ALS, MS, or even
stroke and/or just aging, right?

3144
02:27:03,574 --> 02:27:06,360
That leads you to lose
some of that mobility,

3145
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:09,180
that independence, it's
extremely debilitating.

3146
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:12,030
- And all of these are
opportunities to help people,

3147
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:13,440
to help alleviate suffering,

3148
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:15,360
to help improve the quality of life.

3149
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,650
But each of the things you mentioned

3150
02:27:16,649 --> 02:27:18,539
is its own little puzzle

3151
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:22,890
that needs to have increasing
levels of capability

3152
02:27:22,889 --> 02:27:24,779
from a device like a Neuralink device.

3153
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:27,693
And so the first one
you're focusing on is,

3154
02:27:29,121 --> 02:27:31,379
it's just a beautiful word, telepathy.

3155
02:27:31,379 --> 02:27:33,899
So being able to
communicate using your mind

3156
02:27:33,899 --> 02:27:36,270
wirelessly with a digital device.

3157
02:27:36,270 --> 02:27:40,140
Can you just explain exactly
what we're talking about?

3158
02:27:40,139 --> 02:27:41,849
- Yeah, I mean, it's exactly that.

3159
02:27:41,850 --> 02:27:46,079
I mean, I think if you are
able to control a cursor

3160
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:50,219
and able to click and
be able to get access

3161
02:27:50,219 --> 02:27:52,170
to computer or phone,

3162
02:27:52,170 --> 02:27:55,229
I mean, the whole world opens up to you.

3163
02:27:55,229 --> 02:27:58,649
And I mean, I guess the word telepathy,

3164
02:27:58,649 --> 02:28:00,779
if you kind of think about that

3165
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:04,079
as just definitionally
being able to transfer

3166
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:07,090
information from my brain to your brain

3167
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:12,750
without using some of the
physical faculties that we have,

3168
02:28:12,750 --> 02:28:13,829
like voices.

3169
02:28:13,829 --> 02:28:15,989
- But the interesting thing here is,

3170
02:28:15,989 --> 02:28:18,299
I think the thing that's
not obviously clear

3171
02:28:18,299 --> 02:28:20,459
is how exactly it works.

3172
02:28:20,459 --> 02:28:22,832
So in order to move a cursor,

3173
02:28:24,420 --> 02:28:27,629
there's at least a couple
ways of doing that.

3174
02:28:27,629 --> 02:28:32,579
So one is you imagine
yourself maybe moving a mouse

3175
02:28:32,579 --> 02:28:37,579
with your hand, or you can
then, which Noland talked about,

3176
02:28:38,489 --> 02:28:41,913
like imagine moving the
cursor with your mind.

3177
02:28:44,129 --> 02:28:46,529
But it's like there is
a cognitive step here

3178
02:28:46,530 --> 02:28:48,503
that's fascinating, 'cause
you have to use the brain

3179
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:51,690
and you have to learn
how to use the brain.

3180
02:28:51,690 --> 02:28:54,190
And you kind of have to
figure it out dynamically.

3181
02:28:55,739 --> 02:28:59,250
Because you reward yourself if it works.

3182
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:00,690
I mean, there's a step that,

3183
02:29:00,690 --> 02:29:02,207
this is just a fascinating step,

3184
02:29:02,207 --> 02:29:04,290
'cause you have to get the brain

3185
02:29:04,290 --> 02:29:06,090
to start firing in the right way.

3186
02:29:06,090 --> 02:29:09,183
And you do that by imagining.

3187
02:29:10,799 --> 02:29:12,989
Like fake it till you make it. (laughs)

3188
02:29:12,989 --> 02:29:15,600
And all of a sudden, it creates
the right kind of signal

3189
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:20,250
that if decoded correctly,
can create the kind of effect.

3190
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:21,387
And then there's like noise around that,

3191
02:29:21,387 --> 02:29:22,920
you have to figure all of that out.

3192
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,569
But on the human side,

3193
02:29:24,569 --> 02:29:27,420
imagine the cursor moving
is what you have to do.

3194
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:29,040
- Yeah, he says using the force.

3195
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:29,873
- The force.

3196
02:29:30,809 --> 02:29:33,332
I mean, isn't that just
like fascinating to you

3197
02:29:33,333 --> 02:29:34,950
that it works?

3198
02:29:34,950 --> 02:29:38,163
Like to me, it's like, holy
shit, that actually works.

3199
02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:41,880
Like you could move a
cursor with your mind.

3200
02:29:41,879 --> 02:29:45,779
- As much as you're
learning to use that thing,

3201
02:29:45,780 --> 02:29:47,820
that thing's also learning about you.

3202
02:29:47,819 --> 02:29:50,969
Like our model is constantly
updating the weights

3203
02:29:50,969 --> 02:29:54,369
to say, "Oh, if someone is thinking about

3204
02:29:56,340 --> 02:30:00,000
this sophisticated forms
of like spiking patterns,

3205
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,340
like that actually means
to do this, right?"

3206
02:30:02,340 --> 02:30:04,500
- So the machine is
learning about the human

3207
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:05,819
and the human is learning
about the machine.

3208
02:30:05,819 --> 02:30:07,829
So there is a adaptability

3209
02:30:07,829 --> 02:30:10,409
to the signal processing,
the decoding step.

3210
02:30:10,409 --> 02:30:15,209
And then there's the adaptation
of Noland, the human being.

3211
02:30:15,209 --> 02:30:19,439
Like the same way, if you give
me a new mouse and I move it,

3212
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:21,510
I learn very quickly
about its sensitivity,

3213
02:30:21,510 --> 02:30:23,643
so I learn to move it slower.

3214
02:30:24,989 --> 02:30:28,799
And then there's other
kinds of signal drift

3215
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:30,629
and all that kind of stuff
they have to adapt to.

3216
02:30:30,629 --> 02:30:32,639
So both are adapting to each other.

3217
02:30:32,639 --> 02:30:33,472
- [DJ] Correct.

3218
02:30:34,950 --> 02:30:37,770
- That's a fascinating
like software challenge

3219
02:30:37,770 --> 02:30:40,079
on both sides, the software on both,

3220
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:41,433
the human software and-

3221
02:30:41,433 --> 02:30:43,097
- The organic and the inorganic.

3222
02:30:43,097 --> 02:30:44,940
- The organic and the inorganic.

3223
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:47,190
Anyway, so sorry to rudely interrupt.

3224
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:49,140
So there's this selection

3225
02:30:49,139 --> 02:30:51,782
that Noland has passed with flying colors.

3226
02:30:53,069 --> 02:30:54,916
So everything including that the,

3227
02:30:54,916 --> 02:30:58,289
it's a BCI-friendly home, all of that.

3228
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:02,070
So what is the process of
the surgery implantation,

3229
02:31:02,069 --> 02:31:06,180
the first moment when he
gets to use the system?

3230
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:09,300
- The end to end, we say
patient end to patient out,

3231
02:31:09,299 --> 02:31:12,929
is anywhere between two to four hours.

3232
02:31:12,930 --> 02:31:14,000
In particular case for Noland,

3233
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,170
it was about three and a half hours.

3234
02:31:16,170 --> 02:31:17,340
And there's many steps

3235
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:20,190
leading to the actual
robot insertion, right?

3236
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:22,920
So there's anesthesia induction,

3237
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:26,190
and we do intra-op CT imaging

3238
02:31:26,190 --> 02:31:28,610
to make sure that we're drilling the hole

3239
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:29,970
in the right location.

3240
02:31:29,969 --> 02:31:32,372
And this is also pre-planned beforehand.

3241
02:31:34,620 --> 02:31:36,750
Someone like Nolan would go through fMRI,

3242
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:40,739
and then they can think
about wiggling their hand.

3243
02:31:40,739 --> 02:31:42,780
And obviously, due to their injury,

3244
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:47,550
it's not gonna actually lead
to any sort of intended output.

3245
02:31:47,549 --> 02:31:49,709
But it's the same part of the brain

3246
02:31:49,709 --> 02:31:51,629
that actually lights up
when you're imagining

3247
02:31:51,629 --> 02:31:54,689
moving your finger to
actually moving your finger.

3248
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:57,329
And that's one of the ways
in which we can actually

3249
02:31:57,329 --> 02:32:00,510
know where to place our threads,

3250
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:01,739
'cause we wanna go into what's called

3251
02:32:01,739 --> 02:32:04,469
a hand knob area in the motor cortex.

3252
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:09,272
And as much as possible,
densely put our electro threads.

3253
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:14,489
So yeah, we do intra-op CT imaging

3254
02:32:14,489 --> 02:32:16,110
to make sure and double check

3255
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:18,420
the location of the craniectomy.

3256
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:22,860
And surgeon comes in, does their thing

3257
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:27,450
in terms of like skin
incision, craniectomy,

3258
02:32:27,450 --> 02:32:28,680
so drilling of the skull,

3259
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:30,840
and then there's many
different layers of the brain.

3260
02:32:30,840 --> 02:32:32,190
There's what's called a dura,

3261
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:36,090
which is a very, very thick
layer that surrounds the brain,

3262
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:39,510
that gets actually resected in
a process called atherectomy.

3263
02:32:39,510 --> 02:32:42,569
And that then exposed the pia in the brain

3264
02:32:42,569 --> 02:32:43,860
that you wanna insert.

3265
02:32:43,860 --> 02:32:45,840
And by the time it's been around

3266
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:47,940
anywhere between one to
one and a half hours,

3267
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:51,149
robot comes in, does its thing,
placement of the targets,

3268
02:32:51,149 --> 02:32:52,409
inserting of the thread.

3269
02:32:52,409 --> 02:32:54,899
That takes anywhere
between 20 to 40 minutes.

3270
02:32:54,899 --> 02:32:55,940
In the particular case for Noland,

3271
02:32:55,940 --> 02:32:58,950
it was just under or it
was just over 30 minutes.

3272
02:32:58,950 --> 02:33:01,470
And then after that, the surgeon comes in.

3273
02:33:01,469 --> 02:33:02,459
There's a couple other steps

3274
02:33:02,459 --> 02:33:05,729
of like actually inserting
the dural substitute layer

3275
02:33:05,729 --> 02:33:08,489
to protect the thread
as well as the brain.

3276
02:33:08,489 --> 02:33:13,489
And then yeah, screw in the
implant and then skin flap

3277
02:33:13,889 --> 02:33:16,262
and then suture and then you're out.

3278
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:23,270
- So when Noland woke
up, what was that like?

3279
02:33:23,639 --> 02:33:24,869
What's the recovery like,

3280
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:26,850
and when was the first
time he was able to use it?

3281
02:33:26,850 --> 02:33:30,903
- So he was actually
immediately, after the surgery,

3282
02:33:32,469 --> 02:33:35,019
like an hour after the
surgery as he was waking up,

3283
02:33:36,209 --> 02:33:38,009
we did turn on the device,

3284
02:33:38,010 --> 02:33:40,319
make sure that we are
recording neural signals,

3285
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:43,529
and we actually did have a couple signals

3286
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:46,680
that we notice that he
can actually modulate.

3287
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,300
And what I mean by modulate is that

3288
02:33:48,299 --> 02:33:50,849
he can think about crunching his fist,

3289
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:55,016
and you could see the
spike disappear and appear.

3290
02:33:55,016 --> 02:33:56,850
(Lex laughing)

3291
02:33:56,850 --> 02:33:58,079
- That's awesome.

3292
02:33:58,079 --> 02:34:00,090
- And that was immediate, right?

3293
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:02,460
Immediate after in the recovery room.

3294
02:34:02,459 --> 02:34:04,022
- How cool is that?

3295
02:34:05,610 --> 02:34:07,380
- Yeah.
- That's a human being.

3296
02:34:07,379 --> 02:34:09,379
I mean, what did that feel like for you?

3297
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:12,570
This device and a human being,

3298
02:34:12,569 --> 02:34:15,690
a first step of a gigantic journey?

3299
02:34:15,690 --> 02:34:17,460
I mean, it's a historic moment.

3300
02:34:17,459 --> 02:34:21,842
Even just that spike, just
to be able to modulate that.

3301
02:34:22,799 --> 02:34:26,399
- Obviously, there have been
other, as you mentioned,

3302
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:30,909
pioneers that have participated
in these groundbreaking BCI

3303
02:34:34,020 --> 02:34:36,750
investigational early feasibility studies.

3304
02:34:36,750 --> 02:34:38,819
So we're obviously standing

3305
02:34:38,819 --> 02:34:40,139
in the shoulders of the giants here.

3306
02:34:40,139 --> 02:34:41,670
We're not the first ones to actually

3307
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:44,579
put electrodes in the human brain.

3308
02:34:44,579 --> 02:34:47,852
But I mean, just leading
up to the surgery,

3309
02:34:48,822 --> 02:34:50,462
I definitely could not sleep.

3310
02:34:51,629 --> 02:34:53,369
It's the first time that you're working

3311
02:34:53,370 --> 02:34:55,203
in a completely new environment.

3312
02:34:56,280 --> 02:35:01,280
We had a lot of confidence
based on our benchtop testing

3313
02:35:01,440 --> 02:35:06,329
or preclinical R&D studies
that the mechanism,

3314
02:35:06,329 --> 02:35:10,049
the threads, the insertion,
all that stuff is very safe,

3315
02:35:10,049 --> 02:35:15,049
and that it's obviously ready
for doing this in a human,

3316
02:35:15,780 --> 02:35:18,420
but there's still a lot of unknown unknown

3317
02:35:18,420 --> 02:35:22,920
about can the needle actually insert?

3318
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:26,460
I mean, we brought
something like 40 needles

3319
02:35:26,459 --> 02:35:29,009
just in case they break, and
we ended up using only one.

3320
02:35:29,010 --> 02:35:30,290
But I mean, that was a level

3321
02:35:30,290 --> 02:35:31,577
of just complete unknown, right?

3322
02:35:31,576 --> 02:35:34,019
'Cause it's a very, very
different environment.

3323
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:36,569
And I mean, that's why we do

3324
02:35:36,569 --> 02:35:37,860
clinical trial in the first place

3325
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:40,170
to be able to test these things out.

3326
02:35:40,170 --> 02:35:42,510
So extreme nervousness

3327
02:35:42,510 --> 02:35:46,590
and just many, many sleepless night

3328
02:35:46,590 --> 02:35:47,729
leading up to the surgery

3329
02:35:47,729 --> 02:35:49,649
and definitely the day before the surgery,

3330
02:35:49,649 --> 02:35:50,882
and it was an early morning surgery.

3331
02:35:50,882 --> 02:35:53,163
Like we started at seven in the morning.

3332
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:57,510
And by the time, it was around 10:30.

3333
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:58,770
Everything was done.

3334
02:35:58,770 --> 02:36:02,760
But I mean, first time seeing that,

3335
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:05,350
well, number one, just huge relief

3336
02:36:06,719 --> 02:36:10,022
that this thing is doing
what it's supposed to do.

3337
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:14,520
And two, I mean, just
immense amount of gratitude

3338
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:16,500
for Noland and his family,

3339
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:18,719
and then many others that have applied

3340
02:36:18,719 --> 02:36:21,899
and that we've spoken to and will speak to

3341
02:36:21,899 --> 02:36:25,559
are, I mean, true pioneers everywhere.

3342
02:36:25,559 --> 02:36:27,299
And I sort of call them

3343
02:36:27,299 --> 02:36:29,643
the neural astronauts or neuralnaut.

3344
02:36:31,379 --> 02:36:34,502
These amazing, just
like in the '60s, right?

3345
02:36:34,503 --> 02:36:36,722
Like these amazing just pioneers, right?

3346
02:36:37,709 --> 02:36:40,259
Exploring the unknown outwards.

3347
02:36:40,260 --> 02:36:41,559
In this case, it's inward.

3348
02:36:42,930 --> 02:36:45,630
But incredible amount
of gratitude for them

3349
02:36:45,629 --> 02:36:50,629
to just participate and play a part.

3350
02:36:52,260 --> 02:36:55,773
And it's a journey that
we're embarking on together.

3351
02:36:57,329 --> 02:36:59,940
But also like, I think it was just,

3352
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:01,649
that was an very, very
important milestone,

3353
02:37:01,649 --> 02:37:03,600
but our work was just starting.

3354
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:07,510
So a lot of just kind of anticipation for,

3355
02:37:07,510 --> 02:37:09,389
okay, what needs to happen next?

3356
02:37:09,389 --> 02:37:11,039
What are set of sequences of events

3357
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:13,650
that needs to happen for
us to make it worthwhile

3358
02:37:13,649 --> 02:37:17,819
for both Noland as well as us?

3359
02:37:17,819 --> 02:37:20,756
- Just to linger on that, just
a huge congratulations to you

3360
02:37:20,756 --> 02:37:23,100
and the team for that milestone.

3361
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:27,000
I know there's a lot of work left,

3362
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,632
but that's really exciting to see.

3363
02:37:32,100 --> 02:37:33,870
That's a source of hope.

3364
02:37:33,870 --> 02:37:36,780
It's this first big step,

3365
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:40,620
opportunity to help hundreds
of thousands of people

3366
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:45,510
and then maybe expand
the realm of the possible

3367
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:48,059
for the human mind for millions
of people in the future.

3368
02:37:48,059 --> 02:37:49,920
So it's really exciting.

3369
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:53,606
So like the opportunities
are all ahead of us,

3370
02:37:53,606 --> 02:37:56,129
and to do that safely and
to do that effectively

3371
02:37:56,129 --> 02:37:58,469
was really fun to see.

3372
02:37:58,469 --> 02:38:01,229
As an engineer just watching
other engineers come together

3373
02:38:01,229 --> 02:38:03,299
and do an epic thing, that was awesome.

3374
02:38:03,299 --> 02:38:04,132
Huge congrats.

3375
02:38:04,132 --> 02:38:05,219
- Thank you, thank you.

3376
02:38:05,219 --> 02:38:06,959
Yeah, could not have
done it without the team.

3377
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:09,209
And yeah, I mean, that's the other thing

3378
02:38:09,209 --> 02:38:11,849
that I told the team as well,

3379
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:15,813
of just this immense sense
of optimism for the future.

3380
02:38:16,860 --> 02:38:20,913
I mean, it's a very important
moment for the company,

3381
02:38:21,899 --> 02:38:24,299
needless to say, as well as hopefully

3382
02:38:24,299 --> 02:38:27,359
for many others out
there that we can help.

3383
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:29,310
- So speaking of challenges,

3384
02:38:29,309 --> 02:38:30,959
Neuralink published a blog post

3385
02:38:30,959 --> 02:38:34,109
describing that some of
the threads retracted.

3386
02:38:34,110 --> 02:38:36,120
And so the performance,

3387
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:39,420
as measured by bits per
second dropped at first,

3388
02:38:39,420 --> 02:38:41,370
but then eventually, it was regained.

3389
02:38:41,370 --> 02:38:43,650
And that the whole story
of how it was regained

3390
02:38:43,649 --> 02:38:45,090
is super interesting.

3391
02:38:45,090 --> 02:38:47,190
That's definitely something I'll talk

3392
02:38:47,190 --> 02:38:48,783
to Bliss and to Noland about.

3393
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:54,120
But in general, can you speak
to this whole experience?

3394
02:38:54,120 --> 02:38:56,280
How was the performance regained

3395
02:38:56,280 --> 02:39:01,280
and just the technical
aspects of the threads

3396
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:03,630
being retracted and moving?

3397
02:39:03,629 --> 02:39:06,359
- The main takeaway is that in the end,

3398
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:07,590
the performance have come back

3399
02:39:07,590 --> 02:39:10,979
and it's actually gotten
better than it was before.

3400
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:15,639
He's actually just beat the
world record yet again last week

3401
02:39:16,889 --> 02:39:18,813
to 8.5 BPS, so I mean,

3402
02:39:18,813 --> 02:39:20,639
he's just cranking and
he's just improving.

3403
02:39:20,639 --> 02:39:23,099
- [Lex] The previous one
that he set was eight.

3404
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:24,630
- Correct.
- He said 8.5.

3405
02:39:24,629 --> 02:39:27,422
- Yeah, the previous world
record in human was 4.6.

3406
02:39:28,611 --> 02:39:30,930
- Yeah.
- So it's almost double.

3407
02:39:30,930 --> 02:39:32,639
And his goal is to try to get to 10,

3408
02:39:32,639 --> 02:39:35,969
which is roughly around kind of the median

3409
02:39:35,969 --> 02:39:40,289
Neuralinker using a mouse with the hand.

3410
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:42,360
So it's getting there.

3411
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:45,329
- So yeah, so the
performance was regained.

3412
02:39:45,329 --> 02:39:46,559
- Yeah, better than before.

3413
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:51,559
So that's a story on its own of what took

3414
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:54,599
the BCI team to recover that performance.

3415
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:57,989
It was actually mostly on
kind of the signal processing.

3416
02:39:57,989 --> 02:40:01,289
And so as I mentioned,
we were kind of looking

3417
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:06,290
at these spike outputs
from our electrodes.

3418
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:09,780
And what happened is
that kind of four weeks

3419
02:40:09,780 --> 02:40:12,930
into the surgery, we
noticed that the threads

3420
02:40:12,930 --> 02:40:14,880
have solely come out of the brain.

3421
02:40:14,879 --> 02:40:17,219
And the way in which we noticed
this, at first obviously,

3422
02:40:17,219 --> 02:40:20,219
is that, well, I think Noland
was the first to notice

3423
02:40:20,219 --> 02:40:22,082
that his performance was degrading.

3424
02:40:23,610 --> 02:40:27,030
And I think at the time,
we were also trying to do

3425
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:29,310
a bunch of different experimentation,

3426
02:40:29,309 --> 02:40:33,489
different algorithms,
different sort of UI/UX.

3427
02:40:33,489 --> 02:40:35,909
So it was expected that
there will be variability

3428
02:40:35,909 --> 02:40:40,909
in the performance, but we did
see kind of a steady decline.

3429
02:40:40,979 --> 02:40:45,029
And then also, the way in
which we measure the health

3430
02:40:45,030 --> 02:40:46,980
of the electrodes or whether
they're in the brain or not,

3431
02:40:46,979 --> 02:40:50,219
is by measuring impedance
of the electrode.

3432
02:40:50,219 --> 02:40:52,862
So we look at kind of the interfacial,

3433
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:57,600
kind of the Randall circuit, they say,

3434
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,780
the capacitance and the resistance

3435
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:03,060
between the electrosurface and the medium.

3436
02:41:03,059 --> 02:41:05,549
And if that changes in some dramatic ways,

3437
02:41:05,549 --> 02:41:06,809
we have some indication.

3438
02:41:06,809 --> 02:41:08,850
Or if you're not seeing
spikes on those channels,

3439
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:11,670
you have some indications that
something's happening there.

3440
02:41:11,670 --> 02:41:13,950
And what we notice is that
looking at those impedance plot

3441
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:17,280
and spike rate plots,
and also because we have

3442
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:20,159
those electrodes
recording along the depth,

3443
02:41:20,159 --> 02:41:21,719
you are seeing some sort of movement

3444
02:41:21,719 --> 02:41:24,269
that indicated that the
rest were being pulled out.

3445
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:27,299
And that obviously will
have an implication

3446
02:41:27,299 --> 02:41:30,899
on the model side, because
if the number of inputs

3447
02:41:30,899 --> 02:41:33,539
that are going into the model is changing,

3448
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,193
'cause you have less of them,

3449
02:41:36,659 --> 02:41:38,702
that model needs to get updated, right?

3450
02:41:41,819 --> 02:41:44,369
But there were still
signals, and as I mentioned,

3451
02:41:44,370 --> 02:41:46,470
similar to how, even when
you place the signals

3452
02:41:46,469 --> 02:41:49,799
on the surface of the
brain, or farther away,

3453
02:41:49,799 --> 02:41:52,712
like outside the skull, you
still see some useful signals.

3454
02:41:53,549 --> 02:41:56,699
What we started looking at is
not just the spike occurrence

3455
02:41:56,700 --> 02:41:59,730
through this BOSS
algorithm that I mentioned,

3456
02:41:59,729 --> 02:42:03,149
but we started looking at just the power

3457
02:42:03,149 --> 02:42:06,479
of the frequency band that is interesting

3458
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:10,709
for Noland to be able to modulate.

3459
02:42:10,709 --> 02:42:13,799
So once we kind of change the algorithm

3460
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:17,969
for the implant to not just
give you the BOSS output,

3461
02:42:17,969 --> 02:42:21,090
but also these spike band power output,

3462
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:23,760
that helped us sort of, we find the model

3463
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:26,668
with the new set of inputs,
and that was the thing

3464
02:42:26,668 --> 02:42:29,269
that really ultimately gave
us the performance back.

3465
02:42:31,139 --> 02:42:36,139
In terms of, and obviously,
like the thing that we want

3466
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:39,299
ultimately, and the thing
that we are working towards,

3467
02:42:39,299 --> 02:42:41,459
is figuring out ways in which we can keep

3468
02:42:41,459 --> 02:42:45,239
those threads intact
for as long as possible

3469
02:42:45,239 --> 02:42:49,139
so that we have many more
channels going into the model.

3470
02:42:49,139 --> 02:42:50,939
That's by far the number one priority

3471
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:52,920
that the team is currently embarking on

3472
02:42:52,920 --> 02:42:55,370
to understand how to
prevent that from happening.

3473
02:42:56,729 --> 02:43:00,899
The thing that I'll say also
is that, as I mentioned,

3474
02:43:00,899 --> 02:43:02,309
this is the first time ever

3475
02:43:02,309 --> 02:43:05,100
that we're putting these
thread in a human brain,

3476
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:07,620
and human brain, just for size reference,

3477
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:11,970
is 10 times out of the monkey
brain or the sheep brain.

3478
02:43:11,969 --> 02:43:15,299
And it's just a very, very
different environment.

3479
02:43:15,299 --> 02:43:16,549
It moves a lot more.

3480
02:43:16,549 --> 02:43:19,349
It like actually moved a
lot more than we expected

3481
02:43:19,350 --> 02:43:22,350
when we did Noland's surgery.

3482
02:43:22,350 --> 02:43:26,489
And it's just a very,
very different environment

3483
02:43:26,489 --> 02:43:27,510
than what we're used to.

3484
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:29,909
And this is why we do
clinical trial, right?

3485
02:43:29,909 --> 02:43:33,479
We wanna uncover some of these issues

3486
02:43:33,479 --> 02:43:37,229
and failure modes earlier than later.

3487
02:43:37,229 --> 02:43:39,510
So in many ways, it's provided us

3488
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:42,420
with this enormous amount of data

3489
02:43:42,420 --> 02:43:47,420
and information to be able to solve this.

3490
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:49,530
And this is something that
Neuralink is extremely good at.

3491
02:43:49,530 --> 02:43:51,480
Once we have set of clear objective

3492
02:43:51,479 --> 02:43:54,689
and engineering problem,
we have enormous amount

3493
02:43:54,690 --> 02:43:57,480
of talents across many, many disciplines

3494
02:43:57,479 --> 02:43:59,010
to be able to come together

3495
02:43:59,010 --> 02:44:01,229
and fix the problem very, very quickly.

3496
02:44:01,229 --> 02:44:04,409
- But it sounds like one of
the fascinating challenges here

3497
02:44:04,409 --> 02:44:07,649
is for the system and the decoding side

3498
02:44:07,649 --> 02:44:10,170
to be adaptable across
different timescales.

3499
02:44:10,170 --> 02:44:14,159
So whether it's movement of threads

3500
02:44:14,159 --> 02:44:16,289
or different aspects of signal drift

3501
02:44:16,290 --> 02:44:18,210
sort of on the software
of the human brain,

3502
02:44:18,209 --> 02:44:21,329
something changing,
like Noland talks about

3503
02:44:21,329 --> 02:44:25,289
cursor drift that could be corrected,

3504
02:44:25,290 --> 02:44:27,840
and there's a whole UX
challenge to how to do that.

3505
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:29,489
So it sounds like adaptability

3506
02:44:29,489 --> 02:44:34,489
is like a fundamental property
that has to be engineered in.

3507
02:44:34,860 --> 02:44:37,073
- It is, and I mean I think,

3508
02:44:37,073 --> 02:44:41,430
I mean, as a company, we're
extremely vertically integrated.

3509
02:44:41,430 --> 02:44:45,690
We make these thin film
arrays in our own microfab.

3510
02:44:45,690 --> 02:44:47,940
- Yeah, there's, like
you said, built in-house.

3511
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:50,130
This whole paragraph
here from this blog post

3512
02:44:50,129 --> 02:44:51,092
is pretty gangster.

3513
02:44:51,967 --> 02:44:53,940
"Building the technology described above

3514
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:56,010
has been no small feat."

3515
02:44:56,010 --> 02:44:57,270
And there's a bunch of links here

3516
02:44:57,270 --> 02:44:59,197
that I recommend people click on.

3517
02:44:59,197 --> 02:45:02,340
"We constructed in-house
micro fabrication capabilities

3518
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:05,700
to rapidly produce various
iterations of thin film arrays

3519
02:45:05,700 --> 02:45:08,190
that constitute our electrode threads.

3520
02:45:08,190 --> 02:45:12,510
We created a custom femtosecond laser mill

3521
02:45:12,510 --> 02:45:15,450
to manufacture components
with micro level precision."

3522
02:45:15,450 --> 02:45:16,283
I think there's a tweet
associated with this.

3523
02:45:16,282 --> 02:45:18,659
- That's a whole thing
that we can get into.

3524
02:45:18,659 --> 02:45:23,190
- Yeah, okay, well, what
are we looking at here?

3525
02:45:23,190 --> 02:45:24,606
This thing?
- Yeah.

3526
02:45:24,606 --> 02:45:28,620
"So in less than one minute,
our custom-made femtosecond

3527
02:45:28,620 --> 02:45:33,360
laser mill cuts this geometry
in the tips of our needles."

3528
02:45:33,360 --> 02:45:38,257
So we're looking at this
weirdly-shaped needle.

3529
02:45:38,256 --> 02:45:41,579
"The tip is only 10 to
12 microns in width,

3530
02:45:41,579 --> 02:45:45,030
only slightly larger than the
diameter of a red blood cell.

3531
02:45:45,030 --> 02:45:46,920
The small size allows
threats to be inserted

3532
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:48,329
with minimal damage to the cortex."

3533
02:45:48,329 --> 02:45:51,360
Okay, so what's interesting
about this geometry?

3534
02:45:51,360 --> 02:45:53,700
So we're looking at this
just geometry of a needle.

3535
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:56,250
- This is the needle that's engaging

3536
02:45:56,250 --> 02:45:58,979
with the loops in the thread.

3537
02:45:58,979 --> 02:46:03,979
So they're the ones that thread the loop

3538
02:46:04,049 --> 02:46:06,750
and then peel it from the silicon backing.

3539
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:09,270
And then this is the
thing that gets inserted

3540
02:46:09,270 --> 02:46:12,270
into the tissue, and then this pulls out,

3541
02:46:12,270 --> 02:46:13,530
leaving the thread.

3542
02:46:13,530 --> 02:46:17,909
And this kind of a
notch or the shark tooth

3543
02:46:17,909 --> 02:46:20,700
that we used to call is the thing

3544
02:46:20,700 --> 02:46:23,730
that actually is grasping the loop.

3545
02:46:23,729 --> 02:46:26,369
And then it's designed in such way,

3546
02:46:26,370 --> 02:46:28,253
such that when you pull
out, leaps the loop.

3547
02:46:28,253 --> 02:46:31,020
- And the robot is
controlling this needle?

3548
02:46:31,020 --> 02:46:33,569
- Correct, so this is
actually housed in a cannula.

3549
02:46:33,569 --> 02:46:36,930
And basically, the robot
has a lot of the optics

3550
02:46:36,930 --> 02:46:39,210
that look for where the loop is.

3551
02:46:39,209 --> 02:46:41,489
There's actually a 405 nanometer light

3552
02:46:41,489 --> 02:46:45,629
that actually causes the
polyamide to fluoresce

3553
02:46:45,629 --> 02:46:48,689
so that you can locate
the location of the loop.

3554
02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:49,890
- So the loop lights up?

3555
02:46:50,850 --> 02:46:51,683
- Yeah, yeah, they do.

3556
02:46:51,683 --> 02:46:54,870
It's a micron precision process.

3557
02:46:54,870 --> 02:46:56,130
- What's interesting about the robot

3558
02:46:56,129 --> 02:46:57,269
that it takes to do that?

3559
02:46:57,270 --> 02:46:58,950
That's pretty crazy.

3560
02:46:58,950 --> 02:47:00,120
That's pretty crazy that robot

3561
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:01,890
is able to get this kind of precision.

3562
02:47:01,889 --> 02:47:04,199
- Yeah, our robot is quite heavy.

3563
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:06,030
Our current version of it.

3564
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:10,380
There's, I mean, it's
like a giant granite slab

3565
02:47:10,379 --> 02:47:12,063
that weighs about a ton,

3566
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,390
'cause it needs to be
sensitive to vibration,

3567
02:47:15,389 --> 02:47:16,680
environmental vibration.

3568
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:20,010
And then as the head is moving
at the speed that is moving,

3569
02:47:20,010 --> 02:47:22,770
there's a lot of kind of motion control

3570
02:47:22,770 --> 02:47:26,193
to make sure that you can
achieve that level of precision.

3571
02:47:28,229 --> 02:47:30,869
A lot of optics that
kind of zoom in on that.

3572
02:47:30,870 --> 02:47:33,150
We're working on next
generation of the robot

3573
02:47:33,149 --> 02:47:35,149
that is lighter, easier to transport.

3574
02:47:35,149 --> 02:47:37,649
I mean, it is a feat to move the robot.

3575
02:47:37,649 --> 02:47:40,350
- And it's far superior to a human surgeon

3576
02:47:40,350 --> 02:47:42,239
at this time for this particular task.

3577
02:47:42,239 --> 02:47:44,940
- Absolutely, I mean, let alone
you try to actually thread

3578
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:47,649
a loop in a sewing kit,
I mean this is like,

3579
02:47:47,649 --> 02:47:51,809
we're talking like
fractions of human hair.

3580
02:47:51,809 --> 02:47:54,149
These things, it's not visible.

3581
02:47:54,149 --> 02:47:55,447
- So continuing the paragraph,

3582
02:47:55,447 --> 02:47:57,840
"We developed novel hardware
and software testing systems

3583
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:00,090
such as our accelerated
lifetime testing racks

3584
02:48:00,090 --> 02:48:02,766
and simulated surgery
environment," which is pretty cool,

3585
02:48:02,766 --> 02:48:04,200
"to stress test and validate

3586
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:06,000
the robustness of our technologies.

3587
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,120
We performed many
rehearsals of our surgeries

3588
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:13,800
to refine our procedures and
make them second nature."

3589
02:48:13,799 --> 02:48:14,912
This is pretty cool.

3590
02:48:16,387 --> 02:48:18,060
"We practice surgeries on proxies

3591
02:48:18,059 --> 02:48:21,029
with all the hardware and
instruments needed in our mock

3592
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:22,320
or in the engineering space.

3593
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:24,119
This helps us rapidly test and measure."

3594
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:25,500
So there's like proxies.

3595
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:27,510
- Yeah, this proxy's super cool actually.

3596
02:48:27,510 --> 02:48:32,510
So there's a 3D printed
skull from the images

3597
02:48:32,670 --> 02:48:35,069
that is taken at Barrow,

3598
02:48:35,069 --> 02:48:38,520
as well as this hydrogel mix,

3599
02:48:38,520 --> 02:48:41,250
sort of synthetic polymer
thing that actually mimics

3600
02:48:41,250 --> 02:48:44,280
the mechanical properties of the brain.

3601
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:48,840
It also has vasculature of the person.

3602
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:52,743
So basically, what we're
talking about here,

3603
02:48:53,610 --> 02:48:55,500
and there's a lot of work that has gone

3604
02:48:55,500 --> 02:49:00,500
into making this set proxy that it's about

3605
02:49:00,659 --> 02:49:02,100
like finding the right concentration

3606
02:49:02,100 --> 02:49:03,960
of these different synthetic polymers

3607
02:49:03,959 --> 02:49:07,259
to get the right set of consistency
for the needle dynamics,

3608
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:08,819
as they're being inserted.

3609
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:13,819
But we practice this
surgery with the person,

3610
02:49:14,700 --> 02:49:19,409
Noland's basically physiology
and brain many, many times

3611
02:49:19,409 --> 02:49:20,909
prior to actually doing the surgery.

3612
02:49:20,909 --> 02:49:22,950
- So every step, every step?

3613
02:49:22,950 --> 02:49:23,783
- Every step, yeah.

3614
02:49:23,782 --> 02:49:25,469
Like where does someone stand?

3615
02:49:25,469 --> 02:49:27,689
I mean, what you're
looking at is the picture.

3616
02:49:27,690 --> 02:49:32,690
This is in our office
of this kind of corner

3617
02:49:32,790 --> 02:49:34,230
of the robot engineering space

3618
02:49:34,229 --> 02:49:37,020
that we have created this like mock

3619
02:49:37,020 --> 02:49:39,390
or space that looks exactly like

3620
02:49:39,389 --> 02:49:40,260
what they would experience,

3621
02:49:40,260 --> 02:49:42,300
all the staff would experience
during their actual surgery.

3622
02:49:42,299 --> 02:49:45,629
So I mean, it's just kind
of like any dance rehearsal

3623
02:49:45,629 --> 02:49:47,279
where you know exactly
where you're gonna stand

3624
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:50,430
at what point and you just
practice that over and over

3625
02:49:50,430 --> 02:49:53,280
and over again with an exact anatomy

3626
02:49:53,280 --> 02:49:55,739
of someone that you're going to surgerize.

3627
02:49:55,739 --> 02:49:59,430
And it got to a point where
a lot of our engineers,

3628
02:49:59,430 --> 02:50:01,117
when we created a
craniectomy, they're like,

3629
02:50:01,117 --> 02:50:03,032
"Oh, that looks very familiar.

3630
02:50:03,989 --> 02:50:04,920
We've seen that before."

3631
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:05,879
- Yeah.

3632
02:50:05,879 --> 02:50:08,189
Man, there's wisdom you can gain

3633
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:09,750
through doing the same thing
over and over and over.

3634
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:12,513
It's like a Jira dreams
of sushi kind of thing,

3635
02:50:14,069 --> 02:50:17,350
because then it's like
Olympic athletes visualize

3636
02:50:18,299 --> 02:50:22,439
the Olympics, and then
once you actually show up,

3637
02:50:22,440 --> 02:50:24,000
it feels easy.

3638
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,799
It feels like any other day.

3639
02:50:25,799 --> 02:50:28,619
It feels almost boring
winning the gold medal,

3640
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:31,140
'cause you visualized this so many times,

3641
02:50:31,139 --> 02:50:33,209
you've practiced this so many times,

3642
02:50:33,209 --> 02:50:34,349
and nothing bothers you.

3643
02:50:34,350 --> 02:50:35,280
It's boring.

3644
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:37,260
You win the gold medal, it's boring.

3645
02:50:37,260 --> 02:50:40,532
And the experience they talk
about is mostly just relief,

3646
02:50:41,790 --> 02:50:44,700
probably that they don't
have to visualize it anymore.

3647
02:50:44,700 --> 02:50:47,940
- Yeah, the power of
the mind to visualize,

3648
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:50,130
I mean, there's a whole field that studies

3649
02:50:50,129 --> 02:50:53,879
where muscle memory lies in cerebellum.

3650
02:50:53,879 --> 02:50:54,979
Yeah, it's incredible.

3651
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:59,430
- I think it is a good
place to actually ask

3652
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:01,350
sort of the big question
that people might have is,

3653
02:51:01,350 --> 02:51:03,329
how do we know every aspect of this

3654
02:51:03,329 --> 02:51:05,969
that you describe is safe?

3655
02:51:05,969 --> 02:51:07,500
- At the end of the day, the gold standard

3656
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:08,750
is to look at the tissue.

3657
02:51:10,500 --> 02:51:12,510
What sort of trauma did
you cause the tissue?

3658
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:14,940
And does that correlate
to whatever behavioral

3659
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:16,593
anomalies that you may have seen?

3660
02:51:17,489 --> 02:51:21,899
And that's the language to
which we can communicate

3661
02:51:21,899 --> 02:51:25,406
about the safety of inserting
something into the brain

3662
02:51:25,406 --> 02:51:27,779
and what type of trauma
that you can cause.

3663
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:32,780
So we actually have an entire department,

3664
02:51:33,809 --> 02:51:38,309
department of pathology that
looks at these tissue slices.

3665
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:40,920
There are many steps that
are involved in doing this.

3666
02:51:40,920 --> 02:51:44,979
Once you have studies that are launched

3667
02:51:46,229 --> 02:51:48,750
with particular endpoints in mind,

3668
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:50,760
at some point, you have
to euthanize the animal

3669
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,950
and then you go through necropsy

3670
02:51:52,950 --> 02:51:55,980
to kind of collect the
brain tissue samples.

3671
02:51:55,979 --> 02:51:57,840
You fix them in formalin,

3672
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:00,149
and you like gross them, you section them,

3673
02:52:00,149 --> 02:52:01,889
and you look at individual slices

3674
02:52:01,889 --> 02:52:04,799
just to see what kind of
reaction or lack thereof exists.

3675
02:52:04,799 --> 02:52:08,699
So that's the kind of the
language to which FDA speaks

3676
02:52:08,700 --> 02:52:12,510
and as well for us to kind
of evaluate the safety

3677
02:52:12,510 --> 02:52:15,659
of the insertion mechanism
as well as the threads

3678
02:52:15,659 --> 02:52:17,459
at various different time points.

3679
02:52:17,459 --> 02:52:22,459
Both acute, so anywhere
between zero to three months

3680
02:52:23,610 --> 02:52:25,350
to beyond three months.

3681
02:52:25,350 --> 02:52:26,890
- So those are kind of the details

3682
02:52:26,889 --> 02:52:30,239
of an extremely high standard of safety

3683
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:31,829
that has to be reached.

3684
02:52:31,829 --> 02:52:35,069
- Correct.
- FDA supervises this,

3685
02:52:35,069 --> 02:52:36,959
but this, in general,
just a very high standard.

3686
02:52:36,959 --> 02:52:39,329
And every aspect of this,
including the surgery,

3687
02:52:39,329 --> 02:52:41,909
I think Matthew MacDougall has mentioned

3688
02:52:41,909 --> 02:52:45,512
that like the standard is,

3689
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:49,590
let's say, how to put it politely?

3690
02:52:49,590 --> 02:52:52,049
Higher than maybe some other operations

3691
02:52:52,049 --> 02:52:53,250
that we take for granted.

3692
02:52:53,250 --> 02:52:56,489
So the standard for all
the surgical stuff here

3693
02:52:56,489 --> 02:52:57,539
is extremely high.

3694
02:52:57,540 --> 02:52:58,373
- Very high.

3695
02:52:58,372 --> 02:53:01,350
I mean, it's a highly,
highly regulated environment

3696
02:53:01,350 --> 02:53:06,239
with the governing
agencies that scrutinize

3697
02:53:06,239 --> 02:53:09,299
every medical device that gets marketed.

3698
02:53:09,299 --> 02:53:11,456
And I think it's a good thing.

3699
02:53:11,457 --> 02:53:13,500
It's good to have those high standards,

3700
02:53:13,500 --> 02:53:16,709
and we try to hold
extremely high standards

3701
02:53:16,709 --> 02:53:20,519
to kind of understand what
sort of damage, if any,

3702
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:22,829
these innovative emerging technologies

3703
02:53:22,829 --> 02:53:24,780
and new technologies
that we're building are.

3704
02:53:24,780 --> 02:53:29,610
And so far, we have
been extremely impressed

3705
02:53:29,610 --> 02:53:34,079
by lack of immune response
from these threads.

3706
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:35,372
- Speaking of which,

3707
02:53:36,718 --> 02:53:39,990
you talk to me with
excitement about the histology

3708
02:53:39,989 --> 02:53:43,260
and some of the images
that you're able to share.

3709
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:46,050
Can you explain to me
what we're looking at?

3710
02:53:46,049 --> 02:53:50,729
- Yeah, so what you're looking
at is a stained tissue image.

3711
02:53:50,729 --> 02:53:54,569
So this is a sectioned tissue slice

3712
02:53:54,569 --> 02:53:56,879
from an animal that was
implanted for seven months.

3713
02:53:56,879 --> 02:53:58,799
So kind of a chronic time point.

3714
02:53:58,799 --> 02:54:02,069
And you're seeing all
these different colors,

3715
02:54:02,069 --> 02:54:06,059
and each color indicates
specific types of cell types.

3716
02:54:06,059 --> 02:54:10,680
So purple and pink are astrocytes
and microglia respectably.

3717
02:54:10,680 --> 02:54:12,600
They're types of glial cells.

3718
02:54:12,600 --> 02:54:15,690
And yet the other thing that
people may not be aware of

3719
02:54:15,690 --> 02:54:17,819
is your brain is not just made up

3720
02:54:17,819 --> 02:54:19,829
of soup of neurons and axons.

3721
02:54:19,829 --> 02:54:24,829
There are other cells, like glial cells,

3722
02:54:24,989 --> 02:54:29,639
that actually kind of is
the glue and also react

3723
02:54:29,639 --> 02:54:32,277
if there are any trauma
or damage to the tissue.

3724
02:54:32,277 --> 02:54:33,870
- The brown are the neurons here?

3725
02:54:33,870 --> 02:54:36,570
- The brown are the neurons.
- The modern neurons.

3726
02:54:36,569 --> 02:54:39,479
- So what you're seeing is,
in this kind of macro image,

3727
02:54:39,479 --> 02:54:44,069
you're seeing these like
circle highlighted in white,

3728
02:54:44,069 --> 02:54:45,209
the insertion sites.

3729
02:54:45,209 --> 02:54:49,559
And when you zoom into one of
those, you see the threads.

3730
02:54:49,559 --> 02:54:50,969
And then in this particular case,

3731
02:54:50,969 --> 02:54:54,389
I think we're seeing about the 16 wires

3732
02:54:54,389 --> 02:54:56,459
that are going into the page.

3733
02:54:56,459 --> 02:54:57,962
And the incredible thing here is the fact

3734
02:54:57,962 --> 02:55:01,590
that you have the neurons that
are these brown structures

3735
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:04,229
or brown circular or elliptical thing

3736
02:55:04,229 --> 02:55:07,920
that are actually touching
and abutting the thread.

3737
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:11,190
So what this is saying is that
there's basically zero trauma

3738
02:55:11,190 --> 02:55:12,930
that's caused during this insertion.

3739
02:55:12,930 --> 02:55:15,090
And with these neural interfaces,

3740
02:55:15,090 --> 02:55:17,760
these micro electrodes that you insert,

3741
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:19,920
that is one of the most
common mode of failure.

3742
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:23,250
So when you insert these
threads, like the Utah array,

3743
02:55:23,250 --> 02:55:26,370
it causes neuronal death around the site,

3744
02:55:26,370 --> 02:55:29,250
because you're inserting
a foreign object, right?

3745
02:55:29,250 --> 02:55:32,760
And that kind of elicit
these like immune response

3746
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:34,800
through microglia and astrocytes.

3747
02:55:34,799 --> 02:55:37,709
They form this like
protective layer around it.

3748
02:55:37,709 --> 02:55:39,449
Oh, not only are you
killing the neuron cells,

3749
02:55:39,450 --> 02:55:41,850
but you're also creating
this protective layer

3750
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:43,920
that then basically prevents you

3751
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,120
from recording neural signals,

3752
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:46,740
'cause you're getting
further and further away

3753
02:55:46,739 --> 02:55:48,510
from the neurons that
you're trying to record.

3754
02:55:48,510 --> 02:55:50,416
And that is the biggest mode of failure.

3755
02:55:50,416 --> 02:55:53,920
And in this particular
example, in that inside,

3756
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,010
it's about 50 micron with that scale bar.

3757
02:55:56,010 --> 02:55:58,412
The neurons just seem
to be attracted to it.

3758
02:55:58,412 --> 02:55:59,489
(Lex laughing)

3759
02:55:59,489 --> 02:56:01,139
- And so there's certainly no trauma.

3760
02:56:01,139 --> 02:56:03,739
That's such a beautiful image, by the way.

3761
02:56:03,739 --> 02:56:06,140
So the brown are the neurons.

3762
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:07,590
And for some reason, I can't look away.

3763
02:56:07,590 --> 02:56:09,090
It's really cool.
- Yeah, and the way

3764
02:56:09,090 --> 02:56:10,860
that these things like, I mean,

3765
02:56:10,860 --> 02:56:13,890
your tissues generally don't
have these beautiful colors.

3766
02:56:13,889 --> 02:56:18,689
This is multiplex stain that
uses these different proteins

3767
02:56:18,690 --> 02:56:21,270
that are staining these
at different colors.

3768
02:56:21,270 --> 02:56:24,989
We use very standard set
of staining techniques,

3769
02:56:24,989 --> 02:56:29,879
with HG, EB1 and new N and GFAP.

3770
02:56:29,879 --> 02:56:31,559
So if you go to the next image,

3771
02:56:31,559 --> 02:56:33,629
this is also kind of
illustrates the second point,

3772
02:56:33,629 --> 02:56:35,459
'cause you can make an
argument, and initially,

3773
02:56:35,459 --> 02:56:37,656
when we saw the previous image, we said,

3774
02:56:37,656 --> 02:56:39,420
"Oh, like are the threads just floating?

3775
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:40,469
Like what is happening here?

3776
02:56:40,469 --> 02:56:42,840
Like are we actually
looking at the right thing?"

3777
02:56:42,840 --> 02:56:45,180
So what we did is we did another stain,

3778
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:46,829
and this is all done in-house,

3779
02:56:46,829 --> 02:56:50,219
of this batons, trichrome stain,

3780
02:56:50,219 --> 02:56:53,099
which is in blue that shows
these collagen layers.

3781
02:56:53,100 --> 02:56:54,663
So the blue basically,

3782
02:56:54,663 --> 02:56:58,319
like you don't want the blue
around the implant threads,

3783
02:56:58,319 --> 02:56:59,789
'cause that means that there's some sort

3784
02:56:59,790 --> 02:57:02,070
of scarring that's happen.

3785
02:57:02,069 --> 02:57:04,319
And what you're seeing, if you
look at individual threads,

3786
02:57:04,319 --> 02:57:06,219
is that you don't see any of the blue,

3787
02:57:07,139 --> 02:57:10,139
which means that there
has been absolutely,

3788
02:57:10,139 --> 02:57:13,379
or very, very minimal to a
point where it's not detectable

3789
02:57:13,379 --> 02:57:16,209
amount of trauma in
these inserted threads.

3790
02:57:16,209 --> 02:57:18,389
- So that presumably is
one of the big benefits

3791
02:57:18,389 --> 02:57:20,849
of having this kind of flexible thread.

3792
02:57:20,850 --> 02:57:24,960
- Yeah, so we think this is
primarily due to the size,

3793
02:57:24,959 --> 02:57:27,149
as well as the flexibility of the threads.

3794
02:57:27,149 --> 02:57:30,840
Also the fact that R1
is avoiding vasculature,

3795
02:57:30,840 --> 02:57:32,729
so we're not disrupting

3796
02:57:32,729 --> 02:57:37,049
or we're not causing damage to the vessels

3797
02:57:37,049 --> 02:57:40,619
and not breaking any of
the blood brain barrier

3798
02:57:40,620 --> 02:57:44,613
has basically caused the
immune response to be muted.

3799
02:57:45,569 --> 02:57:47,520
- But this is also a nice illustration

3800
02:57:47,520 --> 02:57:49,170
of the size of things.

3801
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:51,059
So this is the tip of the thread.

3802
02:57:51,059 --> 02:57:53,309
- Yeah, those are neurons.

3803
02:57:53,309 --> 02:57:55,153
- And they're neurons.

3804
02:57:55,153 --> 02:57:56,880
And this is the thread listening.

3805
02:57:56,879 --> 02:57:59,250
And the electrodes are positioned how?

3806
02:57:59,250 --> 02:58:00,180
- Yeah, so this is,

3807
02:58:00,180 --> 02:58:02,309
what you're looking at is
not electrode themselves.

3808
02:58:02,309 --> 02:58:04,439
Those are the conductive wires.

3809
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:08,343
So each of those should
probably be two micron in width.

3810
02:58:09,989 --> 02:58:11,489
So what we're looking at

3811
02:58:11,489 --> 02:58:12,959
is we're looking at the coronal slice.

3812
02:58:12,959 --> 02:58:15,539
So we're looking at some
slice of the tissue.

3813
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,820
So as you go deeper, you'll obviously have

3814
02:58:17,819 --> 02:58:21,122
less and less of the
tapering of the thread.

3815
02:58:22,799 --> 02:58:25,590
But yeah, the point basically being

3816
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:28,770
that there's just kind of
cells around the inserter site,

3817
02:58:28,770 --> 02:58:31,319
which is just an incredible thing to see.

3818
02:58:31,319 --> 02:58:33,659
I've just never seen anything like this.

3819
02:58:33,659 --> 02:58:36,302
- How easy and safe is
it to remove the implant?

3820
02:58:37,649 --> 02:58:39,782
- Yeah, so it depends on when.

3821
02:58:41,347 --> 02:58:45,219
In the first three months
or so after the surgery,

3822
02:58:46,290 --> 02:58:49,740
there's a lot of kind of tissue
modeling that's happening.

3823
02:58:49,739 --> 02:58:51,780
Similar to when you got a cut,

3824
02:58:51,780 --> 02:58:56,780
you obviously start
over first couple weeks,

3825
02:58:57,840 --> 02:59:00,210
or depending on the size of the wound,

3826
02:59:00,209 --> 02:59:01,679
scar tissue forming, right?

3827
02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:03,960
There are these like
contractive, and then in the end,

3828
02:59:03,959 --> 02:59:06,179
they turn into scab and
you can scab it off.

3829
02:59:06,180 --> 02:59:07,722
The same thing happens in the brain,

3830
02:59:07,722 --> 02:59:10,979
and it's a very dynamic environment.

3831
02:59:10,979 --> 02:59:13,770
And before the scar
tissue or the neomembrane

3832
02:59:13,770 --> 02:59:16,380
or the neomembrane that forms,

3833
02:59:16,379 --> 02:59:18,509
it's quite easy to just pull 'em out.

3834
02:59:18,510 --> 02:59:22,530
And there's minimal trauma
that's caused during that.

3835
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:27,120
Once the scar tissue forms,
and with Noland as well,

3836
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:28,260
we believe that that's the thing

3837
02:59:28,260 --> 02:59:29,909
that's currently anchoring the thread.

3838
02:59:29,909 --> 02:59:33,450
So we haven't seen any
more movements since then.

3839
02:59:33,450 --> 02:59:34,773
So they're quite stable.

3840
02:59:37,075 --> 02:59:40,440
It gets harder to actually
completely extract the threads.

3841
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:44,970
So our current method
for removing the device

3842
02:59:44,969 --> 02:59:49,229
is cutting the thread,
leaving the tissue intact,

3843
02:59:49,229 --> 02:59:52,350
and then unscrewing and
taking the implant out.

3844
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:55,829
And that hole is now gonna be plugged

3845
02:59:55,829 --> 02:59:59,370
with either another Neuralink

3846
02:59:59,370 --> 03:00:04,370
or just with kind of a
peak-based, plastic-based cap.

3847
03:00:06,120 --> 03:00:09,329
- Is it okay to leave the
threads in there forever?

3848
03:00:09,329 --> 03:00:10,229
- Yeah, we think so.

3849
03:00:10,229 --> 03:00:13,770
We've done studies where
we left them there,

3850
03:00:13,770 --> 03:00:15,870
and one of the biggest
concerns that we had is like,

3851
03:00:15,870 --> 03:00:17,550
do they migrate and do they get to a point

3852
03:00:17,549 --> 03:00:19,289
where they should not be?

3853
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:20,123
We haven't seen that.

3854
03:00:20,122 --> 03:00:22,139
Again, once the scar tissue forms,

3855
03:00:22,139 --> 03:00:24,090
they get anchored in place.

3856
03:00:24,090 --> 03:00:27,840
And I should also say
that when we say upgrades,

3857
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:31,079
like we're not just
talking in theory here.

3858
03:00:31,079 --> 03:00:34,559
Like we've actually
upgraded many, many times.

3859
03:00:34,559 --> 03:00:38,699
Most of our monkeys or non-human primates,

3860
03:00:38,700 --> 03:00:40,829
NHP have been upgraded.

3861
03:00:40,829 --> 03:00:43,500
Pager, who you saw playing mind pong,

3862
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:46,467
has the latest version of
device since two years ago

3863
03:00:46,467 --> 03:00:49,472
and is seemingly very
happy and healthy and fat.

3864
03:00:51,059 --> 03:00:56,059
- So what's designed for the
future, the upgrade procedure?

3865
03:00:56,520 --> 03:01:00,033
So maybe for Noland.

3866
03:01:01,690 --> 03:01:03,569
What would the upgrade look like?

3867
03:01:03,569 --> 03:01:05,369
It was essentially what you're mentioning.

3868
03:01:05,370 --> 03:01:10,370
Is there a way to upgrade
sort of the device internally,

3869
03:01:10,409 --> 03:01:13,469
where you take it apart and
sort of keep the capsule

3870
03:01:13,469 --> 03:01:14,969
and upgrade the internals?

3871
03:01:14,969 --> 03:01:16,739
- Yeah, so there are a
couple different things here.

3872
03:01:16,739 --> 03:01:18,869
So for Noland, if we were to upgrade,

3873
03:01:18,870 --> 03:01:21,660
what we would have to do
is either cut the threads

3874
03:01:21,659 --> 03:01:24,239
or extract the threads depending on

3875
03:01:24,239 --> 03:01:27,209
kind of the situation there

3876
03:01:27,209 --> 03:01:29,559
in terms of how they're
anchored or scarred in.

3877
03:01:30,569 --> 03:01:34,110
If you were to remove them
with the dural substitute,

3878
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:36,750
you have an intact brain
so you can reinsert

3879
03:01:36,750 --> 03:01:40,413
different threads with the
updated implant package.

3880
03:01:41,670 --> 03:01:45,246
There are a couple different other ways

3881
03:01:46,680 --> 03:01:47,610
that we're thinking about,

3882
03:01:47,610 --> 03:01:50,640
the future of what the
upgradable system looks like.

3883
03:01:50,639 --> 03:01:55,500
One is, at the moment, we
currently remove the dura,

3884
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:58,889
this kind of thick layer
that protects the brain,

3885
03:01:58,889 --> 03:02:00,059
but that actually is the thing

3886
03:02:00,059 --> 03:02:03,119
that actually proliferates
the scar tissue formation.

3887
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,400
So typically, general good rule of thumb

3888
03:02:05,399 --> 03:02:08,096
is you wanna leave the nature as is

3889
03:02:08,096 --> 03:02:09,449
and not disrupt it as much.

3890
03:02:09,450 --> 03:02:13,773
So looking at ways to insert
the threads through the dura,

3891
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:17,370
which comes with different
set of challenges,

3892
03:02:17,370 --> 03:02:20,970
such as it's a pretty thick layer,

3893
03:02:20,969 --> 03:02:22,079
so how do you actually penetrate that

3894
03:02:22,079 --> 03:02:23,309
without breaking the needle?

3895
03:02:23,309 --> 03:02:25,680
So we're looking at different
needle design for that,

3896
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:28,200
as well as the kind of
the loop engagement.

3897
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:31,200
The other biggest challenges
are it's quite opaque,

3898
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:33,600
optically, and with
white light illumination.

3899
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:37,920
So how do you avoid still
this biggest advantage

3900
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:40,139
that we have of avoiding vasculature?

3901
03:02:40,139 --> 03:02:41,039
How do you image through that?

3902
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:42,360
How do you actually still mediate that?

3903
03:02:42,360 --> 03:02:43,920
So there are other imaging techniques

3904
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:45,809
that we're looking at to enable that.

3905
03:02:45,809 --> 03:02:48,750
But our hypothesis is that,

3906
03:02:48,750 --> 03:02:51,840
and based on some of the
early evidence that we have,

3907
03:02:51,840 --> 03:02:55,110
doing through the dura insertion
will cause minimal scarring

3908
03:02:55,110 --> 03:02:58,739
that causes them to be much
easier to extract over time.

3909
03:02:58,739 --> 03:03:00,600
And the other thing that
we're also looking at,

3910
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:03,600
this is gonna be a fundamental change

3911
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:05,370
in the implant architecture,

3912
03:03:05,370 --> 03:03:09,870
is at the moment, it's a
monolithic single implant

3913
03:03:09,870 --> 03:03:12,870
that comes with a thread
that's bonded together.

3914
03:03:12,870 --> 03:03:14,340
So you can't actually
separate the thing out,

3915
03:03:14,340 --> 03:03:16,862
but you can imagine
having two part implant.

3916
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:20,610
Bottom part, that is the
thread that are inserted

3917
03:03:20,610 --> 03:03:25,350
that has the chips and maybe
a radio and some power source.

3918
03:03:25,350 --> 03:03:27,210
And then you have another implant

3919
03:03:27,209 --> 03:03:29,579
that has more of the
computational heavy load

3920
03:03:29,579 --> 03:03:30,962
and the bigger battery.

3921
03:03:31,889 --> 03:03:33,180
And then one can be under the dura,

3922
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:34,409
one can be above the dura,

3923
03:03:34,409 --> 03:03:36,539
like being the plug for the skull.

3924
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:37,440
They can talk to each other,

3925
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:38,909
but the thing that you wanna upgrade,

3926
03:03:38,909 --> 03:03:41,010
the computer and not the thread.

3927
03:03:41,010 --> 03:03:43,079
If you wanna upgrade that,
you just go in there,

3928
03:03:43,079 --> 03:03:45,993
remove the screws and then
put in the next version.

3929
03:03:47,340 --> 03:03:49,079
It's a very, very easy surgery too.

3930
03:03:49,079 --> 03:03:52,799
Like you do a skin incision,
slip this in, screw.

3931
03:03:52,799 --> 03:03:55,259
Probably be able to do this in 10 minutes.

3932
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:57,719
- So that would allow you to
reuse the thread, sort of.

3933
03:03:57,719 --> 03:03:59,340
- [DJ] Correct.

3934
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:01,920
- So I mean, this leads to
the natural question of,

3935
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:03,719
what is the pathway to scaling

3936
03:04:03,719 --> 03:04:06,119
that increase in the number of threads?

3937
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:07,203
Is that a priority?

3938
03:04:08,370 --> 03:04:10,383
What's the technical challenge there?

3939
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:12,540
- Yeah, that is a priority.

3940
03:04:12,540 --> 03:04:14,910
So for next versions of the implant,

3941
03:04:14,909 --> 03:04:17,430
the key metrics that
we're looking to improve

3942
03:04:17,430 --> 03:04:19,079
are number of channels,

3943
03:04:19,079 --> 03:04:21,182
just recording from more and more neurons.

3944
03:04:22,229 --> 03:04:25,229
We have a pathway to actually
go from currently 1,000

3945
03:04:25,229 --> 03:04:29,012
to hopefully 3,000 if not
6,000 by end of this year.

3946
03:04:30,659 --> 03:04:31,739
And then end of next year,

3947
03:04:31,739 --> 03:04:35,340
we wanna get to even more, 16,000.

3948
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:36,690
- Wow.

3949
03:04:36,690 --> 03:04:38,040
- There's a couple limitations to that.

3950
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:39,600
One is obviously being able

3951
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:42,989
to photo lithographically
print those wires.

3952
03:04:42,989 --> 03:04:46,860
As I mentioned, it's two
micron in width and spacing.

3953
03:04:46,860 --> 03:04:49,650
Obviously, there are chips
that are much more advanced

3954
03:04:49,649 --> 03:04:50,819
than those types of resolution,

3955
03:04:50,819 --> 03:04:51,809
and we have some of the tools

3956
03:04:51,809 --> 03:04:55,049
that we have brought in
house to be able to do that.

3957
03:04:55,049 --> 03:04:58,199
So traces will be narrower
just so that you have to have

3958
03:04:58,200 --> 03:05:00,813
more of the wires coming up into the chip.

3959
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:07,320
Chips also cannot linearly
consume more energy,

3960
03:05:07,319 --> 03:05:08,850
as you have more and more channels.

3961
03:05:08,850 --> 03:05:11,149
So there's a lot of
innovations in the circuit

3962
03:05:12,420 --> 03:05:15,059
and architecture as well as
the circuit design topology

3963
03:05:15,059 --> 03:05:17,219
to make them lower power.

3964
03:05:17,219 --> 03:05:18,299
You need to also think about,

3965
03:05:18,299 --> 03:05:20,459
if you have all of these spikes,

3966
03:05:20,459 --> 03:05:22,769
how do you send that off
to the end application?

3967
03:05:22,770 --> 03:05:25,290
So you need to think about
bandwidth limitation there

3968
03:05:25,290 --> 03:05:27,790
and potentially innovations
and signal processing.

3969
03:05:28,709 --> 03:05:30,689
Physically, one of the biggest challenge

3970
03:05:30,690 --> 03:05:34,470
is gonna be the interface.

3971
03:05:34,469 --> 03:05:36,569
It's always the interface that breaks.

3972
03:05:36,569 --> 03:05:41,010
Bonding this thin film
array to the electronics.

3973
03:05:41,010 --> 03:05:43,567
It starts to become very, very
highly dense interconnects.

3974
03:05:43,566 --> 03:05:45,629
So how do you characterize that?

3975
03:05:45,629 --> 03:05:47,429
There's a lot of innovations

3976
03:05:47,430 --> 03:05:51,420
in kind of the 3D integrations
in the recent years

3977
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:52,920
that we can take advantage of.

3978
03:05:53,843 --> 03:05:55,350
One of the biggest
challenges that we do have

3979
03:05:55,350 --> 03:05:58,890
is forming this hermetic barrier, right?

3980
03:05:58,889 --> 03:06:00,840
That this is an extremely
harsh environment

3981
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:02,610
that we're in - the brain.

3982
03:06:02,610 --> 03:06:04,833
So how do you protect it from,

3983
03:06:06,479 --> 03:06:09,420
yeah, like the brain trying
to kill your electronics

3984
03:06:09,420 --> 03:06:11,729
to also your electronics leaking

3985
03:06:11,729 --> 03:06:13,260
things that you don't want into the brain.

3986
03:06:13,260 --> 03:06:15,120
And that forming that hermetic barrier

3987
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:16,800
is gonna be a very, very big challenge

3988
03:06:16,799 --> 03:06:20,429
that we I think are actually
well-suited to tackle.

3989
03:06:20,430 --> 03:06:21,600
- How do you test that?

3990
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:23,970
Like what's the development environment

3991
03:06:23,969 --> 03:06:25,859
to simulate that kind of harshness?

3992
03:06:25,860 --> 03:06:28,980
- Yeah, so this is where
the accelerated life tester

3993
03:06:28,979 --> 03:06:30,752
essentially is a brain in a vat.

3994
03:06:32,417 --> 03:06:35,893
It literally is a vessel
that is made up of,

3995
03:06:35,893 --> 03:06:38,850
and again, for all intents and purpose

3996
03:06:38,850 --> 03:06:40,920
for this particular type of test,

3997
03:06:40,920 --> 03:06:42,753
your brain is a salt water.

3998
03:06:44,879 --> 03:06:49,649
And you can also put some
other set of chemicals

3999
03:06:49,649 --> 03:06:51,059
like reactive oxygen species

4000
03:06:51,059 --> 03:06:53,519
that get at kind of these interfaces

4001
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:58,520
and trying to cause a
reaction to pull it apart.

4002
03:06:58,739 --> 03:07:01,350
But you could also increase the rate

4003
03:07:01,350 --> 03:07:03,989
at which these interfaces are aging

4004
03:07:03,989 --> 03:07:06,239
by just increasing temperature.

4005
03:07:06,239 --> 03:07:08,639
So every 10 degrees
Celsius that you increase,

4006
03:07:08,639 --> 03:07:10,712
you're basically accelerating time by 2x.

4007
03:07:11,790 --> 03:07:13,560
And there's limit as to how much

4008
03:07:13,559 --> 03:07:15,239
temperature you wanna
increase, 'cause at some point,

4009
03:07:15,239 --> 03:07:17,520
there's some other non-linear dynamics

4010
03:07:17,520 --> 03:07:21,659
that causes you to have
other nasty gases to form

4011
03:07:21,659 --> 03:07:23,969
that just is not realistic
in an environment.

4012
03:07:23,969 --> 03:07:27,899
So what we do is we
increase in our ALT chamber

4013
03:07:27,899 --> 03:07:29,100
by 20 degrees Celsius

4014
03:07:29,100 --> 03:07:32,850
that increases the aging by four times.

4015
03:07:32,850 --> 03:07:35,370
So essentially one day in ALT chamber,

4016
03:07:35,370 --> 03:07:37,170
it's four day in calendar year.

4017
03:07:37,170 --> 03:07:42,170
And we look at whether the
implants still are intact,

4018
03:07:42,209 --> 03:07:43,586
including the threads and-

4019
03:07:43,586 --> 03:07:44,816
- And operation and all of that?

4020
03:07:44,816 --> 03:07:46,609
- And operation and all of that.

4021
03:07:46,610 --> 03:07:49,980
It obviously is not an exact
same environment as a brain,

4022
03:07:49,979 --> 03:07:52,199
'cause brain has mechanical,

4023
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:57,120
other more biological
groups that attack at it.

4024
03:07:57,120 --> 03:07:59,370
But it is a good test environment,

4025
03:07:59,370 --> 03:08:02,700
testing environment for
at least the enclosure

4026
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:04,500
and the strength of the enclosure.

4027
03:08:04,500 --> 03:08:06,479
And I mean, we've had implants,

4028
03:08:06,479 --> 03:08:08,819
the current version of the implant

4029
03:08:08,819 --> 03:08:11,699
that has been in there for, I mean,

4030
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:13,230
close to two and a half years,

4031
03:08:13,229 --> 03:08:15,119
which is equivalent to a decade.

4032
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:16,370
And they seem to be fine.

4033
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,254
- So it's interesting that the burn,

4034
03:08:20,254 --> 03:08:25,254
so basically, close
approximation is warm salt water,

4035
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:28,680
hot salt water is a good
testing environment.

4036
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:31,800
Yeah, by the way, I'm drinking LMNT,

4037
03:08:31,799 --> 03:08:36,719
which is basically salt water,
which is making me kinda,

4038
03:08:36,719 --> 03:08:39,119
it doesn't have computational
power the way the brain does,

4039
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:42,810
but maybe in terms of
other characteristics,

4040
03:08:42,809 --> 03:08:44,969
it's quite similar and I'm consuming it.

4041
03:08:44,969 --> 03:08:48,719
- Yeah, you have to get it
in the right pH too. (laughs)

4042
03:08:48,719 --> 03:08:50,489
- And then consciousness will emerge.

4043
03:08:50,489 --> 03:08:51,323
Yeah, no.

4044
03:08:52,559 --> 03:08:54,569
- By the way, the other thing
that also is interesting

4045
03:08:54,569 --> 03:08:58,949
about our enclosure is, if
you look at our implant,

4046
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:03,270
it's not your common-looking
medical implant

4047
03:09:03,270 --> 03:09:07,380
that usually is encased in a titanium can

4048
03:09:07,379 --> 03:09:08,639
that's laser welded.

4049
03:09:08,639 --> 03:09:11,486
We use this polymer called PCTFE,

4050
03:09:11,486 --> 03:09:13,832
polychlorotrifluoroethylene,

4051
03:09:14,940 --> 03:09:18,690
which is actually commonly
used in blister packs.

4052
03:09:18,690 --> 03:09:21,540
So when you have a pill
and you try to pop a pill,

4053
03:09:21,540 --> 03:09:23,310
there's like kind of
that plastic membrane.

4054
03:09:23,309 --> 03:09:24,989
That's what this is.

4055
03:09:24,989 --> 03:09:28,260
No one's actually ever
used this except us.

4056
03:09:28,260 --> 03:09:29,737
And the reason we wanted to do this

4057
03:09:29,736 --> 03:09:32,399
is 'cause it's
electromagnetically transparent.

4058
03:09:32,399 --> 03:09:36,059
So when we talked about
the electromagnetic

4059
03:09:36,059 --> 03:09:38,819
inductive charging, with titanium can,

4060
03:09:38,819 --> 03:09:41,451
usually, if you wanna
do something like that,

4061
03:09:41,451 --> 03:09:42,599
you have to have a sapphire window,

4062
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:45,870
and it's a very, very
tough process to scale.

4063
03:09:45,870 --> 03:09:47,150
- So you're doing a lot of iteration here

4064
03:09:47,149 --> 03:09:48,180
in every aspect of this.

4065
03:09:48,180 --> 03:09:50,610
The materials, the software-

4066
03:09:50,610 --> 03:09:52,083
- The whole, whole shebang.

4067
03:09:53,644 --> 03:09:54,477
- So, okay.

4068
03:09:54,477 --> 03:09:56,073
So you mentioned scaling.

4069
03:09:57,750 --> 03:10:00,629
Is it possible to have
multiple Neuralink devices

4070
03:10:00,629 --> 03:10:04,199
as one of the ways of scaling?

4071
03:10:04,200 --> 03:10:07,260
To have multiple Neuralink
devices implanted?

4072
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:08,579
- That's the goal, that's the goal.

4073
03:10:08,579 --> 03:10:10,649
Yeah, we've had, I mean,

4074
03:10:10,649 --> 03:10:14,189
our monkeys have had two Neuralinks,

4075
03:10:14,189 --> 03:10:15,840
one in each hemisphere.

4076
03:10:15,840 --> 03:10:18,360
And then we're also looking
at potential of having

4077
03:10:18,360 --> 03:10:21,750
one in motor cortex, one in visual cortex,

4078
03:10:21,750 --> 03:10:24,750
and one in wherever other cortex.

4079
03:10:24,750 --> 03:10:27,360
- So focusing on a particular function,

4080
03:10:27,360 --> 03:10:28,650
one Neuralink device.
- Correct.

4081
03:10:28,649 --> 03:10:31,020
- I mean, I wonder if there's
some level of customization

4082
03:10:31,020 --> 03:10:32,790
that can be done on the compute side.

4083
03:10:32,790 --> 03:10:34,050
So for the motor cortex-

4084
03:10:34,049 --> 03:10:35,429
- Absolutely.

4085
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:36,263
That's the goal.

4086
03:10:36,263 --> 03:10:39,720
And we talk about at Neuralink
building a generalized

4087
03:10:39,719 --> 03:10:41,522
neural interface to the brain.

4088
03:10:43,950 --> 03:10:45,659
And that also is strategically

4089
03:10:45,659 --> 03:10:48,899
how we're approaching this with marketing.

4090
03:10:48,899 --> 03:10:52,409
And also, with regulatory, which is,

4091
03:10:52,409 --> 03:10:55,409
hey look, we have the robot,

4092
03:10:55,409 --> 03:10:57,780
and the robot can access
any part of the cortex.

4093
03:10:57,780 --> 03:11:00,090
Right now, we're focused on motor cortex

4094
03:11:00,090 --> 03:11:02,610
with current version of the N1

4095
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:06,840
that's specialized for
motor decoding tasks.

4096
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:07,829
But also, at the end of the day,

4097
03:11:07,829 --> 03:11:10,329
there's kind of a general
compute available there.

4098
03:11:12,930 --> 03:11:14,940
But typically, if you
wanna really get down

4099
03:11:14,940 --> 03:11:17,760
to kind of hyperoptimizing
for power and efficiency,

4100
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:20,510
you do need to get to some
specialized function, right?

4101
03:11:21,959 --> 03:11:23,699
But what we're saying is that,

4102
03:11:23,700 --> 03:11:28,700
hey, you are now used to this
robotic insertion techniques,

4103
03:11:29,100 --> 03:11:31,979
which took many, many
years of showing data

4104
03:11:31,979 --> 03:11:33,962
and conversation with the FDA.

4105
03:11:35,159 --> 03:11:38,670
And also, internally convincing
ourselves that this is safe.

4106
03:11:38,670 --> 03:11:42,079
And now the difference is that

4107
03:11:42,079 --> 03:11:45,299
if we go to other parts of
the brain, like visual cortex,

4108
03:11:45,299 --> 03:11:48,449
which we're interested
in as our second product,

4109
03:11:48,450 --> 03:11:50,190
obviously, it's a completely
different environment.

4110
03:11:50,190 --> 03:11:52,953
The cortex is laid out
very, very differently.

4111
03:11:54,450 --> 03:11:56,250
It's gonna be more stimulation focus

4112
03:11:56,250 --> 03:11:57,870
rather than recording,

4113
03:11:57,870 --> 03:12:00,150
just kind of creating visual percepts.

4114
03:12:00,149 --> 03:12:02,549
But in the end, we're using the same

4115
03:12:02,549 --> 03:12:04,529
thin film array technology.

4116
03:12:04,530 --> 03:12:07,200
We're using the same robot
insertion technology.

4117
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:09,900
We're using the same packaging technology.

4118
03:12:09,899 --> 03:12:12,090
Now, more the conversation
is focused around

4119
03:12:12,090 --> 03:12:14,250
what are the differences
and what are the implication

4120
03:12:14,250 --> 03:12:17,100
of those differences
in safety and efficacy?

4121
03:12:17,100 --> 03:12:19,319
- The way you said second product

4122
03:12:19,319 --> 03:12:22,619
is both hilarious and awesome to me.

4123
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:27,620
That product being restoring
sight for blind people.

4124
03:12:29,639 --> 03:12:34,639
So can you speak to
stimulating the visual cortex?

4125
03:12:35,430 --> 03:12:39,510
I mean, the possibilities
there are just incredible

4126
03:12:39,510 --> 03:12:42,030
to be able to give that
gift back to people

4127
03:12:42,030 --> 03:12:46,770
who don't have sight or
even any aspect of that.

4128
03:12:46,770 --> 03:12:48,690
Can you just speak to the challenges of,

4129
03:12:48,690 --> 03:12:50,790
there's several challenges here.

4130
03:12:50,790 --> 03:12:52,380
- Oh, many.
- One of which is,

4131
03:12:52,379 --> 03:12:55,859
like you said, from
recording to stimulation.

4132
03:12:55,860 --> 03:12:57,540
Just any aspect of that

4133
03:12:57,540 --> 03:13:01,353
that you're both excited
and see the challenges of.

4134
03:13:02,729 --> 03:13:04,262
- Yeah, I guess I'll start by saying

4135
03:13:04,263 --> 03:13:08,040
that we actually have been capable

4136
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:10,470
of stimulating through our thin film array

4137
03:13:10,469 --> 03:13:13,352
as well as other electronics for years.

4138
03:13:14,850 --> 03:13:17,489
We have actually demonstrated
some of that capabilities

4139
03:13:17,489 --> 03:13:19,952
for reanimating the
limb in the spinal cord.

4140
03:13:21,750 --> 03:13:24,930
Obviously, for the current EFS study,

4141
03:13:24,930 --> 03:13:27,050
we've hardware disabled that,

4142
03:13:27,049 --> 03:13:29,429
so that's something
that we wanted to embark

4143
03:13:29,430 --> 03:13:31,030
as a separate, separate journey.

4144
03:13:32,670 --> 03:13:34,979
And obviously, there are
many, many different ways

4145
03:13:34,979 --> 03:13:37,739
to write information into the brain.

4146
03:13:37,739 --> 03:13:40,440
The way in which we're doing
that is through electrical,

4147
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:44,010
passing electrical current,
and kind of causing that

4148
03:13:44,010 --> 03:13:47,010
to really change the local environment

4149
03:13:47,010 --> 03:13:51,110
so that you can sort of artificially cause

4150
03:13:51,110 --> 03:13:54,993
kind of the neurons to
depolarize in nearby areas.

4151
03:13:56,280 --> 03:14:01,280
For vision specifically, the
way our visual system works,

4152
03:14:02,309 --> 03:14:03,629
it's both well-understood.

4153
03:14:03,629 --> 03:14:05,819
I mean, anything with kind of brain,

4154
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:07,619
there are aspects of it
that's well-understood.

4155
03:14:07,620 --> 03:14:10,020
But in the end, like we
don't really know anything.

4156
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:11,573
But the way visual system works

4157
03:14:11,573 --> 03:14:14,850
is that you have photon hitting your eye,

4158
03:14:14,850 --> 03:14:19,770
and in your eyes, there
are these specialized cells

4159
03:14:19,770 --> 03:14:21,930
called photoreceptor cells

4160
03:14:21,930 --> 03:14:25,683
that convert the photon energy
into electrical signals.

4161
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:30,810
That then gets projected
to your back of your head,

4162
03:14:30,809 --> 03:14:31,952
your visual cortex.

4163
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:36,390
It goes through actually thalamic system

4164
03:14:36,389 --> 03:14:38,670
called LGN that then projects it out.

4165
03:14:38,670 --> 03:14:40,110
And then in the visual cortex,

4166
03:14:40,110 --> 03:14:44,190
there's visual area one or V1,

4167
03:14:44,190 --> 03:14:46,260
and then there's bunch
of other higher level

4168
03:14:46,260 --> 03:14:48,479
processing layers like V2, V3.

4169
03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:51,389
And there there are actually
kind of interesting parallels.

4170
03:14:51,389 --> 03:14:54,180
And when you study the behaviors

4171
03:14:54,180 --> 03:14:56,700
of these convolutional neural networks,

4172
03:14:56,700 --> 03:15:00,840
like what the different layers
of the network is detecting,

4173
03:15:00,840 --> 03:15:03,149
first, they're detecting like these edges,

4174
03:15:03,149 --> 03:15:06,119
and they're then detecting
some more natural curves,

4175
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:08,490
and then they start to
detect like objects, right?

4176
03:15:08,489 --> 03:15:10,319
Kind of similar thing
happens in the brain.

4177
03:15:10,319 --> 03:15:12,360
And a lot of that has been inspired,

4178
03:15:12,360 --> 03:15:14,310
and also, it's been kinda exciting to see

4179
03:15:14,309 --> 03:15:15,859
some of the correlations there.

4180
03:15:16,709 --> 03:15:21,299
But things like from there,
where those cognition arise

4181
03:15:21,299 --> 03:15:23,819
and where's color encoded,

4182
03:15:23,819 --> 03:15:26,670
there's just not a lot of understanding,

4183
03:15:26,670 --> 03:15:28,409
fundamental understanding there.

4184
03:15:28,409 --> 03:15:32,069
So in terms of kind of bringing sight back

4185
03:15:32,069 --> 03:15:33,692
to those that are blind,

4186
03:15:34,649 --> 03:15:36,899
there are many different
forms of blindness.

4187
03:15:36,899 --> 03:15:38,609
There's actually million people,

4188
03:15:38,610 --> 03:15:41,430
one million people in the
U.S. that are legally blind.

4189
03:15:41,430 --> 03:15:44,909
That means like certain, like score below

4190
03:15:44,909 --> 03:15:47,039
in kind of the visual tests.

4191
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:48,330
I think it's something like,

4192
03:15:48,329 --> 03:15:52,260
if you can see something
at 20 feet distance,

4193
03:15:52,260 --> 03:15:55,139
that normal people can
see at 200 feet distance,

4194
03:15:55,139 --> 03:15:57,750
like if you're worse than
that, you're legally blind.

4195
03:15:57,750 --> 03:16:00,780
- So that means you can't
function effectively.

4196
03:16:00,780 --> 03:16:02,520
- Correct.
- Using sight in the world.

4197
03:16:02,520 --> 03:16:04,953
- Yeah, like to navigate your environment.

4198
03:16:06,059 --> 03:16:08,909
And yeah, there are
different forms of blindness.

4199
03:16:08,909 --> 03:16:13,229
There are forms of blindness
where there's some degeneration

4200
03:16:13,229 --> 03:16:17,549
of your retina, these photoreceptor cells,

4201
03:16:17,549 --> 03:16:22,289
and rest of your visual processing

4202
03:16:22,290 --> 03:16:24,330
that I described is intact.

4203
03:16:24,329 --> 03:16:27,690
And for those types of individuals,

4204
03:16:27,690 --> 03:16:30,149
you may not need to maybe stick electrodes

4205
03:16:30,149 --> 03:16:31,559
into the visual cortex.

4206
03:16:31,559 --> 03:16:36,559
You can actually build
retinal prosthetic devices

4207
03:16:37,110 --> 03:16:39,000
that actually just replaces the function

4208
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:41,010
of that retinal cells
that are degenerated.

4209
03:16:41,010 --> 03:16:43,170
And there are many companies
that are working on that.

4210
03:16:43,170 --> 03:16:45,120
But that's a very small slice.

4211
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:48,120
Albeit significance, those smaller slice

4212
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:49,953
of folks that are legally blind.

4213
03:16:51,629 --> 03:16:53,729
If there's any damage
along that circuitry,

4214
03:16:53,729 --> 03:16:55,409
whether it's in the optic nerve

4215
03:16:55,409 --> 03:16:58,559
or just the LGN circuitry

4216
03:16:58,559 --> 03:17:00,299
or any break in that circuit,

4217
03:17:00,299 --> 03:17:02,609
that's not gonna work for you.

4218
03:17:02,610 --> 03:17:07,610
And the source of where
you need to actually

4219
03:17:08,610 --> 03:17:11,430
cause that visual percept to happen,

4220
03:17:11,430 --> 03:17:14,220
because your biological
mechanism not doing that

4221
03:17:14,219 --> 03:17:16,349
is by placing electrodes
in the visual cortex

4222
03:17:16,350 --> 03:17:17,640
in the back of your head.

4223
03:17:17,639 --> 03:17:19,042
And the way in which this would work

4224
03:17:19,042 --> 03:17:21,719
is that you would have an external camera,

4225
03:17:21,719 --> 03:17:26,719
whether it's something as
unsophisticated as a GoPro

4226
03:17:27,149 --> 03:17:31,592
or some sort of wearable
RayBan type glasses

4227
03:17:31,593 --> 03:17:35,490
that Meta's working on that
captures a scene, right?

4228
03:17:35,489 --> 03:17:38,369
And that scene is then converted

4229
03:17:38,370 --> 03:17:41,550
to set of electrical impulses
or stimulation pulses

4230
03:17:41,549 --> 03:17:45,029
that you would activate
in your visual cortex

4231
03:17:45,030 --> 03:17:48,120
through these thin film arrays.

4232
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:53,120
And by playing in a
concerted kind of orchestra

4233
03:17:55,170 --> 03:17:56,670
of these stimulation patterns,

4234
03:17:56,670 --> 03:17:58,500
you can create what's called phosphenes,

4235
03:17:58,500 --> 03:18:01,350
which are these kind
of white yellowish dots

4236
03:18:01,350 --> 03:18:04,409
that you can also create
by just pressing your eyes.

4237
03:18:04,409 --> 03:18:06,209
You can actually create those percepts

4238
03:18:06,209 --> 03:18:08,309
by stimulating in the visual cortex.

4239
03:18:08,309 --> 03:18:11,729
And the name of the game is
really have many of those

4240
03:18:11,729 --> 03:18:13,199
and have those percepts be,

4241
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:15,090
the phosphenes be as small as possible

4242
03:18:15,090 --> 03:18:16,710
so that you can start to tell apart,

4243
03:18:16,709 --> 03:18:20,459
like they're the individual
pixels of the screen, right?

4244
03:18:20,459 --> 03:18:22,619
So if you have many, many of those,

4245
03:18:22,620 --> 03:18:24,170
potentially, you'll be able to,

4246
03:18:26,459 --> 03:18:28,379
in the long term, be able to actually get

4247
03:18:28,379 --> 03:18:29,609
naturalistic vision.

4248
03:18:29,610 --> 03:18:32,760
But in the like short
term to maybe midterm,

4249
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:34,829
being able to at least be able to have

4250
03:18:34,829 --> 03:18:39,829
object detection algorithms
run on your glasses,

4251
03:18:39,959 --> 03:18:41,639
the pre-op processing units,

4252
03:18:41,639 --> 03:18:43,920
and then being able to at
least see the edges of things

4253
03:18:43,920 --> 03:18:45,370
so you don't bump into stuff.

4254
03:18:46,319 --> 03:18:47,369
- It's incredible.

4255
03:18:47,370 --> 03:18:48,600
This is really incredible.

4256
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:50,670
So you basically would be adding pixels,

4257
03:18:50,670 --> 03:18:52,319
and your brain would start to figure out

4258
03:18:52,319 --> 03:18:54,360
what those pixels mean.

4259
03:18:54,360 --> 03:18:57,450
Yeah, and like with
different kinds of assistant

4260
03:18:57,450 --> 03:18:59,520
on the signal processing on all fronts.

4261
03:18:59,520 --> 03:19:00,450
- Yeah.

4262
03:19:00,450 --> 03:19:01,430
The thing that actually,

4263
03:19:01,430 --> 03:19:02,263
so a couple things.

4264
03:19:02,263 --> 03:19:06,813
One is, obviously, if
you're blind from birth,

4265
03:19:08,100 --> 03:19:10,550
the way brain works,
especially in the early age,

4266
03:19:12,629 --> 03:19:14,339
neuroplasticity is really nothing

4267
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:17,159
other than kind of your brain

4268
03:19:17,159 --> 03:19:18,659
and different parts of your brain

4269
03:19:18,659 --> 03:19:20,775
fighting for the limited territory.

4270
03:19:20,775 --> 03:19:21,899
- [Lex] (laughs) Yeah.

4271
03:19:21,899 --> 03:19:24,029
- And I mean, very, very quickly,

4272
03:19:24,030 --> 03:19:27,000
you see cases where you
know people that are,

4273
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:29,579
I mean, you also hear
about people who are blind

4274
03:19:29,579 --> 03:19:33,569
that have heightened sense of
hearing or some other senses.

4275
03:19:33,569 --> 03:19:36,059
And the reason for that is that cortex

4276
03:19:36,059 --> 03:19:37,859
that's not used just gets taken over

4277
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:39,600
by these different parts of the cortex.

4278
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:41,403
So for those types of individuals,

4279
03:19:43,530 --> 03:19:46,050
I mean, I guess they're
going to have to now map

4280
03:19:46,049 --> 03:19:49,829
some other parts of their senses
into what they call vision.

4281
03:19:49,829 --> 03:19:51,510
But it's gonna be obviously

4282
03:19:51,510 --> 03:19:55,593
a very, very different
conscious experience before.

4283
03:19:56,549 --> 03:19:59,250
So I think that's a interesting caveat.

4284
03:19:59,250 --> 03:20:01,229
The other thing that also
is important to highlight

4285
03:20:01,229 --> 03:20:05,639
is that we're currently
limited by our biology

4286
03:20:05,639 --> 03:20:08,699
in terms of the wavelength
that we can see.

4287
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:11,190
There's a very, very small wavelength

4288
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:13,800
that is a visible light wavelength

4289
03:20:13,799 --> 03:20:15,029
that we can see with our eyes.

4290
03:20:15,030 --> 03:20:18,659
But when you have an external
camera with this BCI system,

4291
03:20:18,659 --> 03:20:19,680
you're not limited to that.

4292
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:21,750
You can have infrared, you can have UV,

4293
03:20:21,750 --> 03:20:24,719
you can have whatever other
spectrum that you want to see.

4294
03:20:24,719 --> 03:20:25,729
And whether that gets matched

4295
03:20:25,729 --> 03:20:28,889
to some sort of weird conscious
experience, I've no idea.

4296
03:20:28,889 --> 03:20:32,789
But oftentimes, I talk to people

4297
03:20:32,790 --> 03:20:34,050
about the goal of Neuralink

4298
03:20:34,049 --> 03:20:36,899
being going beyond the
limits of our biology.

4299
03:20:36,899 --> 03:20:39,359
That's sort of what I mean.

4300
03:20:39,360 --> 03:20:43,650
- And if you're able to
control the kind of raw signal,

4301
03:20:43,649 --> 03:20:48,270
when we use our sight,
we're getting the photons

4302
03:20:48,270 --> 03:20:50,909
and there's not much processing on it.

4303
03:20:50,909 --> 03:20:52,950
If you're being able
to control that signal,

4304
03:20:52,950 --> 03:20:54,420
maybe you can do some kind of processing.

4305
03:20:54,420 --> 03:20:56,760
Maybe you do object
detection ahead of time.

4306
03:20:56,760 --> 03:20:57,593
- [DJ] Yeah.

4307
03:20:57,593 --> 03:20:59,670
- You're doing some
kind of pre-processing,

4308
03:20:59,670 --> 03:21:02,340
and there's a lot of
possibilities to explore that.

4309
03:21:02,340 --> 03:21:06,600
So it's not just increasing
sort of thermal imaging,

4310
03:21:06,600 --> 03:21:09,510
that kind of stuff, but it's
also just doing some kind

4311
03:21:09,510 --> 03:21:11,729
of interesting processing.
- Correct, yeah.

4312
03:21:11,729 --> 03:21:15,569
I mean, my theory of how
like visual system works also

4313
03:21:15,569 --> 03:21:19,920
is that, I mean, there's
just so many things

4314
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:22,590
happening in the world, and
there's a lot of photons

4315
03:21:22,590 --> 03:21:26,280
that are going into your
eye, and it's unclear exactly

4316
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:29,220
where some of the pre-processing
steps are happening.

4317
03:21:29,219 --> 03:21:31,619
But I mean, I actually think that just

4318
03:21:31,620 --> 03:21:36,603
from a fundamental perspective,
there's just so much,

4319
03:21:37,676 --> 03:21:40,529
the reality that we're
in, if it's a reality,

4320
03:21:40,530 --> 03:21:43,590
is so there's so much data.

4321
03:21:43,590 --> 03:21:46,389
And I think humans are
just unable to actually

4322
03:21:47,280 --> 03:21:49,980
like eat enough actually to
process all that information.

4323
03:21:49,979 --> 03:21:52,170
So there's some sort of
filtering that does happen,

4324
03:21:52,170 --> 03:21:53,399
whether that happens in the retina,

4325
03:21:53,399 --> 03:21:54,779
whether that happens in different layers

4326
03:21:54,780 --> 03:21:57,030
of the visual cortex.

4327
03:21:57,030 --> 03:21:57,863
Unclear.

4328
03:21:57,862 --> 03:22:01,412
But like the analogy that
I sometimes think about is,

4329
03:22:02,940 --> 03:22:05,460
if your brain is a CCD camera,

4330
03:22:05,459 --> 03:22:09,032
and all of the information
in the world is a sun,

4331
03:22:10,170 --> 03:22:11,909
and when you try to
actually look at the sun

4332
03:22:11,909 --> 03:22:12,809
with the CCD camera,

4333
03:22:12,809 --> 03:22:14,266
it's just gonna saturate
the sensors, right?

4334
03:22:14,266 --> 03:22:16,350
'Cause it's enormous amount of energy.

4335
03:22:16,350 --> 03:22:20,309
So what you do is you end up
adding these filters, right?

4336
03:22:20,309 --> 03:22:22,590
To just kind of narrow the information

4337
03:22:22,590 --> 03:22:25,229
that's coming to you and being captured.

4338
03:22:25,229 --> 03:22:30,229
And I think things like our experiences

4339
03:22:31,139 --> 03:22:34,546
or our like drugs like propofol,

4340
03:22:37,649 --> 03:22:40,379
that like anesthetic drug or psychedelics,

4341
03:22:40,379 --> 03:22:43,199
what they're doing is
they're kind of swapping out

4342
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:46,260
these filters and putting in
new ones or removing older ones

4343
03:22:46,260 --> 03:22:50,069
and kind of controlling
our conscious experience.

4344
03:22:50,069 --> 03:22:51,719
- Yeah, man, not to
distract from the topic,

4345
03:22:51,719 --> 03:22:53,819
but I just took a very
high dose of ayahuasca

4346
03:22:53,819 --> 03:22:54,809
in the Amazon jungle.

4347
03:22:54,809 --> 03:22:57,779
So yes, it's a nice way to think about it.

4348
03:22:57,780 --> 03:23:01,020
You're swapping out different experiences,

4349
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:04,409
and with Neuralink being
able to control that,

4350
03:23:04,409 --> 03:23:07,860
primarily at first, to improve function,

4351
03:23:07,860 --> 03:23:11,190
not for entertainment purposes
or enjoyment purposes, but-

4352
03:23:11,190 --> 03:23:12,899
- Yeah, giving back lost functions.

4353
03:23:12,899 --> 03:23:15,239
- Well, giving back lost functions.

4354
03:23:15,239 --> 03:23:19,289
And there, especially when the
function is completely lost,

4355
03:23:19,290 --> 03:23:21,930
anything is a huge help.

4356
03:23:21,930 --> 03:23:26,483
Would you implant a Neuralink
device in your own brain?

4357
03:23:29,100 --> 03:23:30,030
- Absolutely.

4358
03:23:30,030 --> 03:23:33,450
I mean, maybe not right
now, but absolutely.

4359
03:23:33,450 --> 03:23:35,970
- What kind of capability, once reached,

4360
03:23:35,969 --> 03:23:38,129
you would start getting real curious

4361
03:23:38,129 --> 03:23:39,813
and almost get a little antsy,

4362
03:23:41,022 --> 03:23:43,439
like jealous of people that get it

4363
03:23:43,440 --> 03:23:45,063
as you watch them get implanted?

4364
03:23:46,319 --> 03:23:47,302
- Yeah, I mean I think,

4365
03:23:47,302 --> 03:23:49,649
I mean, even with our early participants,

4366
03:23:49,649 --> 03:23:54,059
if they start to do
things that I can't do,

4367
03:23:54,059 --> 03:23:56,789
which I think is in the
realm of possibility

4368
03:23:56,790 --> 03:23:59,940
for them to be able to get, 15, 20,

4369
03:23:59,940 --> 03:24:02,850
if not like 100 BPS right?

4370
03:24:02,850 --> 03:24:04,950
There's nothing that
fundamentally stops us

4371
03:24:04,950 --> 03:24:07,563
from being able to achieve
that type of performance.

4372
03:24:10,171 --> 03:24:13,050
I mean, I would certainly get
jealous that they can do that.

4373
03:24:13,049 --> 03:24:14,519
- I should say that watching Noland,

4374
03:24:14,520 --> 03:24:17,250
I get a little jealous 'cause
he's having so much fun,

4375
03:24:17,250 --> 03:24:19,920
and it seems like such a
chill way to play video games.

4376
03:24:19,920 --> 03:24:21,059
- Yeah.

4377
03:24:21,059 --> 03:24:23,159
So I mean, the thing that also is hard

4378
03:24:23,159 --> 03:24:24,843
to appreciate sometimes is that,

4379
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:30,360
he's doing these things while talking.

4380
03:24:30,360 --> 03:24:32,090
I mean, it's multitasking, right?

4381
03:24:32,090 --> 03:24:34,170
So it's clearly,

4382
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:37,409
it's obviously cognitively intensive,

4383
03:24:37,409 --> 03:24:39,840
but similar to how, when we talk,

4384
03:24:39,840 --> 03:24:43,680
we move our hands, like these
things like are multitasking.

4385
03:24:43,680 --> 03:24:45,030
I mean, he's able to do that.

4386
03:24:45,030 --> 03:24:46,950
And you won't be able to do that

4387
03:24:46,950 --> 03:24:51,360
with other assistive
technology as far as I'm aware.

4388
03:24:51,360 --> 03:24:54,840
If you're obviously using
like an eye tracking device,

4389
03:24:54,840 --> 03:24:56,370
you're very much fixated

4390
03:24:56,370 --> 03:24:57,600
on that thing that you're trying to do.

4391
03:24:57,600 --> 03:24:58,890
And if you're using voice control,

4392
03:24:58,889 --> 03:25:01,408
I mean, like if you say some other stuff,

4393
03:25:01,408 --> 03:25:02,242
yeah, you don't get to use that.

4394
03:25:02,242 --> 03:25:05,090
- Yeah, the multitasking aspect of that

4395
03:25:05,090 --> 03:25:06,030
is really interesting.

4396
03:25:06,030 --> 03:25:09,450
So it's not just the BPS
for the primary task.

4397
03:25:09,450 --> 03:25:13,170
It's the parallelization
of multiple tasks.

4398
03:25:13,170 --> 03:25:14,850
If you measure the BPS

4399
03:25:14,850 --> 03:25:16,800
for the entirety of the human organism,

4400
03:25:16,799 --> 03:25:21,799
so if you're talking and
doing a thing with your mind

4401
03:25:21,930 --> 03:25:25,559
and looking around also, I mean,

4402
03:25:25,559 --> 03:25:28,108
there's just a lot of paralyzation
that can be happening.

4403
03:25:28,108 --> 03:25:28,941
- Yeah.

4404
03:25:28,941 --> 03:25:30,030
But I mean, I think at some point for him,

4405
03:25:30,030 --> 03:25:32,460
like if he wants to really
achieve those high level BPS,

4406
03:25:32,459 --> 03:25:34,799
it does require like
full attention, right?

4407
03:25:34,799 --> 03:25:39,209
And that's a separate circuitry
that is a big mystery.

4408
03:25:39,209 --> 03:25:41,099
Like how attention works and, you know?

4409
03:25:41,100 --> 03:25:43,050
- Yeah, attention, like cognitive load,

4410
03:25:44,030 --> 03:25:47,940
I've read a lot of literature
on people doing two tasks.

4411
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:51,237
Like you have your primary
task and a secondary task.

4412
03:25:51,236 --> 03:25:54,509
And the secondary task is
a source of distraction.

4413
03:25:54,510 --> 03:25:55,409
And how does that affect

4414
03:25:55,409 --> 03:25:56,850
the performance of the primary task?

4415
03:25:56,850 --> 03:25:59,850
And depending on the tasks,
there's a lot of interesting,

4416
03:25:59,850 --> 03:26:02,159
I mean, this is an interesting
computational device, right?

4417
03:26:02,159 --> 03:26:05,309
And I think-
- To say the least.

4418
03:26:05,309 --> 03:26:06,510
- A lot of novel insights

4419
03:26:06,510 --> 03:26:07,343
that can be gained from everything.

4420
03:26:07,343 --> 03:26:09,030
I mean, I personally am surprised

4421
03:26:09,030 --> 03:26:12,920
that Noland's able to do
such incredible control

4422
03:26:12,920 --> 03:26:15,329
of the cursor while talking

4423
03:26:15,329 --> 03:26:17,297
and also being nervous at the same time,

4424
03:26:17,297 --> 03:26:19,110
'cause he's talking like all of us are,

4425
03:26:19,110 --> 03:26:20,790
if you're talking in front of the camera,

4426
03:26:20,790 --> 03:26:21,623
you get nervous.

4427
03:26:21,622 --> 03:26:23,951
So all of those are coming into play,

4428
03:26:23,951 --> 03:26:26,402
and he is able to still
achieve high performance.

4429
03:26:27,360 --> 03:26:28,200
Surprising.

4430
03:26:28,200 --> 03:26:30,100
I mean, all of this is really amazing.

4431
03:26:31,049 --> 03:26:35,519
And I think just after
researching this really in depth,

4432
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:36,930
I kind of want Neuralink.

4433
03:26:36,930 --> 03:26:39,720
- (laughs) Get in line.

4434
03:26:39,719 --> 03:26:41,369
- And also, the safety get in line.

4435
03:26:41,370 --> 03:26:43,020
Well, we should say the registry

4436
03:26:43,020 --> 03:26:45,420
is for people who have quadriplegia

4437
03:26:45,420 --> 03:26:46,620
and all that kind of stuff so-
- Correct.

4438
03:26:46,620 --> 03:26:50,283
- There'll be a separate line for people.

4439
03:26:52,229 --> 03:26:57,229
They're just curious, like myself.

4440
03:26:57,450 --> 03:26:59,810
So now that Noland, patient P1,

4441
03:26:59,809 --> 03:27:01,563
is part of the ongoing prime study,

4442
03:27:02,610 --> 03:27:07,350
what's the high level
vision for P2, P3, P4, P5?

4443
03:27:07,350 --> 03:27:11,250
And just the expansion
into other human beings

4444
03:27:11,250 --> 03:27:13,472
that are getting to
experience this implant?

4445
03:27:14,909 --> 03:27:17,969
- Yeah, I mean, the primary goal is,

4446
03:27:17,969 --> 03:27:19,229
for our study in the first place

4447
03:27:19,229 --> 03:27:21,090
is to achieve safety endpoints.

4448
03:27:21,090 --> 03:27:26,090
Just understand safety of this device,

4449
03:27:26,563 --> 03:27:29,163
as well as the implantation process.

4450
03:27:30,930 --> 03:27:33,809
And also, at the same time,
understand the efficacy

4451
03:27:33,809 --> 03:27:34,979
and the impact that it could have

4452
03:27:34,979 --> 03:27:37,413
on the potential users' lives.

4453
03:27:38,579 --> 03:27:43,579
And just because you have,

4454
03:27:43,649 --> 03:27:45,059
you're living with tetraplegia,

4455
03:27:45,059 --> 03:27:46,260
it doesn't mean your situation

4456
03:27:46,260 --> 03:27:48,930
is same as another person
living with tetraplegia.

4457
03:27:48,930 --> 03:27:51,183
It's wildly, wildly varying.

4458
03:27:54,120 --> 03:27:57,120
It's something that we're
hoping to also understand

4459
03:27:57,120 --> 03:27:59,550
how our technology can serve

4460
03:27:59,549 --> 03:28:01,709
not just a very small
slice of those individuals,

4461
03:28:01,709 --> 03:28:03,599
but broader group of individuals

4462
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:07,890
and being able to get the
feedback to just really build

4463
03:28:07,889 --> 03:28:09,872
just the best product for them.

4464
03:28:13,950 --> 03:28:16,950
There's obviously also goals that we have,

4465
03:28:16,950 --> 03:28:20,909
and the primary purpose of
the early feasibility study

4466
03:28:20,909 --> 03:28:24,389
is to learn from each
and every participant

4467
03:28:24,389 --> 03:28:26,969
to improve the device, improve the surgery

4468
03:28:26,969 --> 03:28:30,389
before we embark on what's
called a pivotal study

4469
03:28:30,389 --> 03:28:34,139
that then is much larger trial

4470
03:28:36,239 --> 03:28:39,149
that starts to look at
statistical significance

4471
03:28:39,149 --> 03:28:41,789
of your endpoints, and that's required

4472
03:28:41,790 --> 03:28:43,713
before you can then market the device.

4473
03:28:45,075 --> 03:28:46,586
And that's how it works in the U.S.

4474
03:28:46,586 --> 03:28:48,359
and just generally around the world.

4475
03:28:48,360 --> 03:28:50,100
That's the process you follow.

4476
03:28:50,100 --> 03:28:52,950
So our goal is to really just understand

4477
03:28:52,950 --> 03:28:56,730
from people like Noland,
P2, P3, future participants,

4478
03:28:56,729 --> 03:28:59,219
what aspects of our
device needs to improve.

4479
03:28:59,219 --> 03:29:01,117
If it turns out that people are like,

4480
03:29:01,117 --> 03:29:03,630
"I really don't like the fact
that it lasts only six hours.

4481
03:29:03,629 --> 03:29:08,309
I wanna be able to use this
computer for like 24 hours."

4482
03:29:08,309 --> 03:29:13,309
I mean, that is a user
needs and user requirements,

4483
03:29:13,440 --> 03:29:14,819
which we can only find out

4484
03:29:14,819 --> 03:29:17,250
from just being able to engage with them.

4485
03:29:17,250 --> 03:29:18,540
- So before the pivotal study,

4486
03:29:18,540 --> 03:29:20,460
there's kind of like a rapid innovation

4487
03:29:20,459 --> 03:29:21,989
based on individual experiences.

4488
03:29:21,989 --> 03:29:25,079
You're learning from individual
people how they use it,

4489
03:29:25,079 --> 03:29:28,649
like the high resolution details

4490
03:29:28,649 --> 03:29:30,629
in terms of like cursor control and signal

4491
03:29:30,629 --> 03:29:32,759
and all that kind of stuff
to like life experience.

4492
03:29:32,760 --> 03:29:34,950
- Yeah, yeah, so there's hardware changes

4493
03:29:34,950 --> 03:29:37,500
but also just firmware updates.

4494
03:29:37,500 --> 03:29:42,500
So even when we had that sort
of recovery event for Noland,

4495
03:29:44,010 --> 03:29:49,010
he now has the new firmware
that he has been updated with.

4496
03:29:50,010 --> 03:29:51,960
And it's similar to how like your phones

4497
03:29:51,959 --> 03:29:53,189
get updated all the time

4498
03:29:53,190 --> 03:29:55,020
with new firmware for security patches,

4499
03:29:55,020 --> 03:29:57,690
whatever new functionality UI, right?

4500
03:29:57,690 --> 03:30:00,000
And that's something that is
possible with our implant.

4501
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,319
It's not a static one-time device

4502
03:30:03,406 --> 03:30:05,880
that can only do the thing
that it said it can do.

4503
03:30:05,879 --> 03:30:06,899
I mean, it's similar to Tesla.

4504
03:30:06,899 --> 03:30:08,940
You can do over the air firmware updates,

4505
03:30:08,940 --> 03:30:11,880
and now you have completely
new user interface.

4506
03:30:11,879 --> 03:30:14,969
And all this bells and
whistles and improvements

4507
03:30:14,969 --> 03:30:17,522
on everything like the latest, right?

4508
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:21,300
When we say generalized platform,

4509
03:30:21,299 --> 03:30:22,409
that's what we're talking about.

4510
03:30:22,409 --> 03:30:24,930
- Yeah, it's really cool how
the app that Noland is using,

4511
03:30:24,930 --> 03:30:28,139
there's like calibration,
all that kind of stuff.

4512
03:30:28,139 --> 03:30:29,912
And then there's update.

4513
03:30:32,370 --> 03:30:35,670
You just click and get an update.

4514
03:30:35,670 --> 03:30:39,870
What other future capabilities
are you kinda looking to?

4515
03:30:39,870 --> 03:30:40,920
You said vision.

4516
03:30:40,920 --> 03:30:42,750
That's a fascinating one.

4517
03:30:42,750 --> 03:30:46,079
What about sort of
accelerated typing or speech,

4518
03:30:46,079 --> 03:30:47,030
this kind of stuff?

4519
03:30:48,397 --> 03:30:49,806
And what else is there?

4520
03:30:49,807 --> 03:30:54,030
- Yeah, those are still in
the realm of movement program.

4521
03:30:54,030 --> 03:30:56,159
So largely speaking, we have two programs.

4522
03:30:56,159 --> 03:30:57,270
We have the movement program

4523
03:30:57,270 --> 03:30:59,640
and we have the vision program.

4524
03:30:59,639 --> 03:31:02,219
The movement program
currently is focused around

4525
03:31:02,219 --> 03:31:03,779
the digital freedom.

4526
03:31:03,780 --> 03:31:07,050
As you can easily guess,
if you can control

4527
03:31:07,049 --> 03:31:08,939
2D cursor in the digital space,

4528
03:31:08,940 --> 03:31:11,610
you could move anything
in the physical space.

4529
03:31:11,610 --> 03:31:15,210
So robotic arms, wheelchair,
your environment,

4530
03:31:15,209 --> 03:31:17,789
or even really like, whether
it's through the phone

4531
03:31:17,790 --> 03:31:19,980
or just like directly to those interfaces,

4532
03:31:19,979 --> 03:31:22,680
so like to those machines.

4533
03:31:22,680 --> 03:31:25,050
So we're looking at ways to kind of expand

4534
03:31:25,049 --> 03:31:28,019
those types of capability,
even for Noland.

4535
03:31:28,020 --> 03:31:30,390
That requires conversation with the FDA

4536
03:31:30,389 --> 03:31:33,629
and kind of showing safety data for,

4537
03:31:33,629 --> 03:31:35,339
if there's a robotic arm or a wheelchair

4538
03:31:35,340 --> 03:31:37,500
that we can guarantee that
they're not gonna hurt

4539
03:31:37,500 --> 03:31:39,569
themselves accidentally, right?

4540
03:31:39,569 --> 03:31:41,159
It's very different if you're moving stuff

4541
03:31:41,159 --> 03:31:43,559
in the digital domain versus
like in the physical space,

4542
03:31:43,559 --> 03:31:48,149
you can actually potentially
cause harm to the participants.

4543
03:31:48,149 --> 03:31:50,729
So we're working through that right now.

4544
03:31:50,729 --> 03:31:54,239
Speech does involve
different areas of the brain.

4545
03:31:54,239 --> 03:31:56,639
Speech prosthetic is
very, very fascinating,

4546
03:31:56,639 --> 03:32:00,989
and there's actually been a
lot of really amazing work

4547
03:32:00,989 --> 03:32:02,690
that's been happening in academia.

4548
03:32:03,750 --> 03:32:07,229
Sergei Stavisky at UC
Davis, Jaimie Henderson,

4549
03:32:07,229 --> 03:32:10,739
and late Krishna Shenoy at Stanford

4550
03:32:10,739 --> 03:32:12,449
doing just some incredible amount of work

4551
03:32:12,450 --> 03:32:15,720
in improving speech neuroprosthetics.

4552
03:32:15,719 --> 03:32:18,809
And those are actually looking more

4553
03:32:18,809 --> 03:32:20,670
at parts of the motor cortex

4554
03:32:20,670 --> 03:32:24,329
that are controlling
these focal articulators.

4555
03:32:24,329 --> 03:32:25,889
And being able to like,

4556
03:32:25,889 --> 03:32:29,250
even by mouthing the
word or imagine speech,

4557
03:32:29,250 --> 03:32:30,903
you can pick up those signals.

4558
03:32:31,889 --> 03:32:34,709
The more sophisticated higher
level processing areas,

4559
03:32:34,709 --> 03:32:38,519
like the Broca's area or Wernicke's area,

4560
03:32:38,520 --> 03:32:41,700
those are still very, very big mystery

4561
03:32:41,700 --> 03:32:43,800
in terms of the underlying mechanism

4562
03:32:43,799 --> 03:32:45,389
of how all that stuff works.

4563
03:32:45,389 --> 03:32:50,010
But yeah, I mean, I think
Neuralink's event goal

4564
03:32:50,010 --> 03:32:52,620
is to kind of understand those things

4565
03:32:52,620 --> 03:32:55,050
and be able to provide
a platform and tools

4566
03:32:55,049 --> 03:32:58,019
to be able to understand
that and study that.

4567
03:32:58,020 --> 03:33:00,573
- This is where I get to
the pothead questions.

4568
03:33:01,739 --> 03:33:03,629
Do you think we can start getting insight

4569
03:33:03,629 --> 03:33:06,152
into things like thought?

4570
03:33:07,170 --> 03:33:09,809
So speech is,

4571
03:33:09,809 --> 03:33:11,939
there's a muscular
component, like you said.

4572
03:33:11,940 --> 03:33:14,760
There's like the act of producing sounds.

4573
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:18,393
But then what about the
internal things like cognition?

4574
03:33:19,559 --> 03:33:21,750
Like low level thoughts
and high level thoughts.

4575
03:33:21,750 --> 03:33:23,610
Do you think we'll start noticing

4576
03:33:23,610 --> 03:33:25,623
kind of signals that could be picked up?

4577
03:33:28,906 --> 03:33:31,559
They could be understood,
they could be maybe used

4578
03:33:31,559 --> 03:33:34,292
in order to interact
with the outside world.

4579
03:33:35,969 --> 03:33:37,769
- In some ways, like I guess this starts

4580
03:33:37,770 --> 03:33:40,743
to kind of get into the heart
problem of consciousness.

4581
03:33:42,360 --> 03:33:47,360
And I mean, on one hand,

4582
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:50,309
all of these are, at some point,

4583
03:33:50,309 --> 03:33:53,039
set of electrical signals,

4584
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:57,987
that from there, maybe it in itself

4585
03:33:59,819 --> 03:34:02,219
is giving you the
cognition or the meaning,

4586
03:34:02,219 --> 03:34:06,599
or somehow, human mind
is incredibly amazing

4587
03:34:06,600 --> 03:34:07,829
storytelling machine.

4588
03:34:07,829 --> 03:34:10,350
So we're telling ourselves
and fooling ourselves

4589
03:34:10,350 --> 03:34:12,500
that there's some
interesting meaning here.

4590
03:34:13,680 --> 03:34:18,680
But I mean, I certainly think that BCI

4591
03:34:19,110 --> 03:34:20,760
and really BCI at the end of the day

4592
03:34:20,760 --> 03:34:23,850
is a set of tools that
help you kind of study

4593
03:34:23,850 --> 03:34:27,329
the underlying mechanisms
in both like local

4594
03:34:27,329 --> 03:34:28,802
but also broader sense.

4595
03:34:30,750 --> 03:34:34,139
And whether there's some
interesting patterns

4596
03:34:34,139 --> 03:34:35,609
of like electrical signal,

4597
03:34:35,610 --> 03:34:38,850
that means like you're
thinking this versus,

4598
03:34:38,850 --> 03:34:40,290
and you can either like learn

4599
03:34:40,290 --> 03:34:43,830
from like many, many sets of
data to correlate some of that

4600
03:34:43,829 --> 03:34:45,539
and be able to do mind reading or not.

4601
03:34:45,540 --> 03:34:46,373
I'm not sure.

4602
03:34:47,280 --> 03:34:50,100
I certainly would not
kind of rule that out

4603
03:34:50,100 --> 03:34:55,020
as a possibility, but I think BCI alone

4604
03:34:55,020 --> 03:34:55,950
probably can't do that.

4605
03:34:55,950 --> 03:35:00,310
There's probably additional
set of tools and framework.

4606
03:35:00,309 --> 03:35:02,879
And also, like just heart
problem of consciousness

4607
03:35:02,879 --> 03:35:04,019
at the end of the day is rooted

4608
03:35:04,020 --> 03:35:06,030
in this philosophical question of like,

4609
03:35:06,030 --> 03:35:07,530
what's the meaning of it all?

4610
03:35:07,530 --> 03:35:09,630
What's the nature of our existence?

4611
03:35:09,629 --> 03:35:12,129
Where's the mind emerge
from this complex network?

4612
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:17,520
- Yeah, how does the
subjective experience emerge

4613
03:35:17,520 --> 03:35:21,149
from just a bunch of
spikes, electrical spikes?

4614
03:35:21,149 --> 03:35:23,996
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, we
do really think about BCI

4615
03:35:23,996 --> 03:35:25,469
and what we're building as a tool

4616
03:35:25,469 --> 03:35:29,672
for understanding the mind, the brain.

4617
03:35:30,659 --> 03:35:32,209
The only question that matters.

4618
03:35:33,239 --> 03:35:34,649
There's actually,

4619
03:35:34,649 --> 03:35:39,649
there actually is some
biological existence proof

4620
03:35:40,409 --> 03:35:43,649
of like what it would take
to kind of start to form

4621
03:35:43,649 --> 03:35:46,202
some of these experiences
that may be unique.

4622
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:50,670
If you actually look at
every one of our brains,

4623
03:35:50,670 --> 03:35:51,930
there are two hemispheres.

4624
03:35:51,930 --> 03:35:54,540
There's a left-sided brain,
there's a right-sided brain.

4625
03:35:54,540 --> 03:35:59,540
And I mean, unless you
have some other conditions,

4626
03:35:59,909 --> 03:36:04,876
you normally don't feel like
left legs or right legs.

4627
03:36:04,876 --> 03:36:07,079
Like you just feel like one legs, right?

4628
03:36:07,079 --> 03:36:10,200
So what is happening there, right?

4629
03:36:10,200 --> 03:36:13,320
If you actually look
at the two hemispheres,

4630
03:36:13,319 --> 03:36:17,430
there's a structure that
kind of characterize the two

4631
03:36:17,430 --> 03:36:21,389
called the corpus callosum
that is supposed to have

4632
03:36:21,389 --> 03:36:25,653
around 200 to 300 million
connections or axons.

4633
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:31,380
So whether that means that's
the number of interface

4634
03:36:31,379 --> 03:36:33,029
and electrodes that we need

4635
03:36:33,030 --> 03:36:37,382
to create some sort of
mind meld, or from that,

4636
03:36:37,382 --> 03:36:39,483
like whatever new conscious experience

4637
03:36:39,483 --> 03:36:41,013
that you can experience.

4638
03:36:42,659 --> 03:36:45,360
But yeah, I do think that there's like

4639
03:36:45,360 --> 03:36:50,350
kind of an interesting existence
proof that we all have.

4640
03:36:52,680 --> 03:36:55,649
- And that threshold is
unknown at this time.

4641
03:36:55,649 --> 03:36:56,520
- Oh yeah, these things,

4642
03:36:56,520 --> 03:37:00,390
everything in this domain
is speculation, right?

4643
03:37:00,389 --> 03:37:01,742
- And then there would be,

4644
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:06,033
you'd be continuously
pleasantly surprised.

4645
03:37:08,790 --> 03:37:12,273
Do you see a world where
there's millions of people,

4646
03:37:13,260 --> 03:37:15,389
like tens of millions,
hundreds of millions of people

4647
03:37:15,389 --> 03:37:18,420
walking around with a Neuralink device,

4648
03:37:18,420 --> 03:37:20,850
or multiple Neuralink
devices in their brain?

4649
03:37:20,850 --> 03:37:21,683
- I do.

4650
03:37:21,683 --> 03:37:23,190
First of all, there are,

4651
03:37:23,190 --> 03:37:25,860
like if you look at
worldwide, people suffering

4652
03:37:25,860 --> 03:37:28,650
from movement disorders
and visual deficits.

4653
03:37:28,649 --> 03:37:33,449
I mean, that's in the tens if not hundreds

4654
03:37:33,450 --> 03:37:34,773
of millions of people.

4655
03:37:35,807 --> 03:37:39,630
So that alone, I think,
there's a lot of benefit

4656
03:37:39,629 --> 03:37:41,969
and potential good that we can do

4657
03:37:41,969 --> 03:37:43,472
with this type of technology.

4658
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:48,030
And once you start to
get into kind of neuro,

4659
03:37:48,030 --> 03:37:51,273
like psychiatric application, depression,

4660
03:37:53,010 --> 03:37:57,329
anxiety, hunger, or obesity, right?

4661
03:37:57,329 --> 03:38:00,539
Like mood, control of appetite,

4662
03:38:00,540 --> 03:38:05,540
I mean, that starts to
become very real to everyone.

4663
03:38:06,569 --> 03:38:11,569
- Not to mention that most people on earth

4664
03:38:11,579 --> 03:38:12,722
have a smartphone.

4665
03:38:13,559 --> 03:38:18,539
And once BCI starts
competing with a smartphone

4666
03:38:18,540 --> 03:38:20,220
as a preferred methodology

4667
03:38:20,219 --> 03:38:22,469
of interacting with the digital world,

4668
03:38:22,469 --> 03:38:24,389
that also becomes an interesting thing.

4669
03:38:24,389 --> 03:38:25,439
- Oh yeah, I mean, yeah.

4670
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:26,663
This is even before going to that, right?

4671
03:38:26,663 --> 03:38:28,773
I mean, there's like almost,

4672
03:38:29,729 --> 03:38:31,260
I mean, the entire world

4673
03:38:31,260 --> 03:38:33,780
that could benefit from
these types of thing.

4674
03:38:33,780 --> 03:38:35,909
And then, yeah, like
if we're talking about

4675
03:38:35,909 --> 03:38:38,309
kind of next generation
of how we interface with

4676
03:38:39,690 --> 03:38:42,390
machines or even ourselves,

4677
03:38:42,389 --> 03:38:47,389
in many ways, I think BCI
can play a role in that.

4678
03:38:47,670 --> 03:38:51,210
And some of the things
that I also talk about

4679
03:38:51,209 --> 03:38:53,339
is I do think that there
is a real possibility

4680
03:38:53,340 --> 03:38:56,969
that you could see eight billion people

4681
03:38:56,969 --> 03:38:58,799
walking around with Neuralink.

4682
03:38:58,799 --> 03:39:01,590
- Well, thank you so
much for pushing ahead.

4683
03:39:01,590 --> 03:39:04,500
And I look forward to
that exciting feature.

4684
03:39:04,500 --> 03:39:06,180
- Thanks for having me.

4685
03:39:06,180 --> 03:39:09,032
- Thanks for listening to
this conversation with DJ Seo.

4686
03:39:09,989 --> 03:39:13,770
And now, dear friends,
here's Matthew MacDougall,

4687
03:39:13,770 --> 03:39:16,497
the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink.

4688
03:39:17,390 --> 03:39:21,569
When did you first become
fascinated with the human brain?

4689
03:39:21,569 --> 03:39:22,829
- Since forever.

4690
03:39:22,829 --> 03:39:24,629
As far back as I can remember,

4691
03:39:24,629 --> 03:39:26,279
I've been interested in the human brain.

4692
03:39:26,280 --> 03:39:30,570
I mean, I was a thoughtful kid

4693
03:39:30,569 --> 03:39:34,020
and a bit of an outsider.

4694
03:39:34,020 --> 03:39:37,005
And you sit there thinking about

4695
03:39:37,004 --> 03:39:39,354
what the most important
things in the world are

4696
03:39:40,680 --> 03:39:43,440
in your little tiny adolescent brain.

4697
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:46,440
And the answer that I came to,

4698
03:39:46,440 --> 03:39:50,909
that I converged on was
that all of the things

4699
03:39:50,909 --> 03:39:54,479
you can possibly conceive of,
as things that are important

4700
03:39:54,479 --> 03:39:56,850
for human beings to care about

4701
03:39:56,850 --> 03:40:00,899
are literally contained in the skull.

4702
03:40:00,899 --> 03:40:03,840
Both the perception of them
and their relative values.

4703
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:07,049
And the solutions to all our problems

4704
03:40:07,049 --> 03:40:10,379
and all of our problems are
all contained in the skull.

4705
03:40:10,379 --> 03:40:14,012
And if we knew more about how that worked,

4706
03:40:15,149 --> 03:40:18,090
how the brain encodes information

4707
03:40:18,090 --> 03:40:22,862
and generates desires and
generates agony and suffering,

4708
03:40:25,528 --> 03:40:27,569
we could do more about it.

4709
03:40:27,569 --> 03:40:30,090
You think about all the
really great triumphs

4710
03:40:30,090 --> 03:40:30,923
in human history.

4711
03:40:30,923 --> 03:40:33,603
You think about all the
really horrific tragedies.

4712
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:36,959
You think about the holocaust,

4713
03:40:36,959 --> 03:40:41,959
you think about any prison
full of human stories,

4714
03:40:44,219 --> 03:40:49,219
and all of those problems
boil down to neurochemistry.

4715
03:40:50,760 --> 03:40:53,159
So if you get a little
bit of control over that,

4716
03:40:54,149 --> 03:40:56,940
you provide people the
option to do better.

4717
03:40:56,940 --> 03:40:58,890
And in the way I read history,

4718
03:40:58,889 --> 03:41:01,619
the way people have dealt
with having better tools

4719
03:41:01,620 --> 03:41:05,880
is that they most often
in the end do better,

4720
03:41:05,879 --> 03:41:08,399
with huge asterisk.

4721
03:41:08,399 --> 03:41:11,219
But I think it's an interesting,

4722
03:41:11,219 --> 03:41:13,139
a worthy and noble pursuit

4723
03:41:13,139 --> 03:41:16,049
to give people more options, more tools.

4724
03:41:16,049 --> 03:41:18,659
- Yeah, that's a fascinating
way to look at human history.

4725
03:41:18,659 --> 03:41:21,959
You just imagine all these
neurobiological mechanisms,

4726
03:41:21,959 --> 03:41:25,349
Stalin, Hitler, all of these, Gengis Khan,

4727
03:41:25,350 --> 03:41:28,470
all of them just had like a brain,

4728
03:41:28,469 --> 03:41:31,170
just a bunch of neurons,

4729
03:41:31,170 --> 03:41:33,399
like a few tons of billions of neurons

4730
03:41:34,709 --> 03:41:36,662
gaining a bunch of information
over a period of time.

4731
03:41:36,663 --> 03:41:38,130
They have a set of module

4732
03:41:38,129 --> 03:41:40,559
that does language and
memory and all that.

4733
03:41:40,559 --> 03:41:43,170
And from there, in the
case of those people,

4734
03:41:43,170 --> 03:41:44,902
they're able to murder millions of people.

4735
03:41:44,902 --> 03:41:45,735
- [Matthew] Yeah.

4736
03:41:45,735 --> 03:41:47,913
- All that coming from,

4737
03:41:49,709 --> 03:41:54,359
there's not some glorified
notion of a dictator

4738
03:41:54,360 --> 03:41:57,442
of this enormous mind
or something like this.

4739
03:41:57,441 --> 03:41:59,250
It's just the brain.

4740
03:41:59,250 --> 03:42:01,049
- Yeah, yeah.

4741
03:42:01,049 --> 03:42:04,469
I mean, a lot of that
has to do with how well

4742
03:42:04,469 --> 03:42:08,309
people like that can
organize those around them.

4743
03:42:08,309 --> 03:42:09,143
- Other brains.

4744
03:42:09,143 --> 03:42:12,209
- Yeah, and so I always
find it interesting

4745
03:42:12,209 --> 03:42:14,250
to look to primatology,

4746
03:42:14,250 --> 03:42:17,129
look to our closest non-human relatives

4747
03:42:17,129 --> 03:42:20,309
for clues as to how
humans are going to behave

4748
03:42:20,309 --> 03:42:25,109
and what particular humans
are able to achieve.

4749
03:42:25,110 --> 03:42:29,880
And so you look at chimpanzees and bonobos

4750
03:42:29,879 --> 03:42:32,639
and they're similar but different

4751
03:42:32,639 --> 03:42:35,073
in their social structures particularly.

4752
03:42:36,059 --> 03:42:38,489
And I went to Emory in Atlanta

4753
03:42:38,489 --> 03:42:41,729
and studied under Frans,
the great Frans de Waal,

4754
03:42:41,729 --> 03:42:46,319
who was kind of the leading
primatologist who recently died,

4755
03:42:46,319 --> 03:42:51,319
and his work at looking
at chimps through the lens

4756
03:42:52,290 --> 03:42:55,080
of how you would watch
an episode of "Friends"

4757
03:42:55,079 --> 03:42:57,059
and understand the motivations

4758
03:42:57,059 --> 03:42:58,709
of the characters
interacting with each other.

4759
03:42:58,709 --> 03:43:00,569
He would look at a chimp colony

4760
03:43:00,569 --> 03:43:02,219
and basically apply that lens.

4761
03:43:02,219 --> 03:43:05,219
I'm massively oversimplifying it.

4762
03:43:05,219 --> 03:43:07,412
If you do that, instead of just saying,

4763
03:43:08,340 --> 03:43:13,027
subject 473 through his
feces at subject 471,

4764
03:43:15,090 --> 03:43:18,989
you talk about them in terms
of their human struggles,

4765
03:43:18,989 --> 03:43:23,280
accord them the dignity
of themselves as actors

4766
03:43:23,280 --> 03:43:27,000
with understandable goals and drives,

4767
03:43:27,000 --> 03:43:28,469
what they want out of life.

4768
03:43:28,469 --> 03:43:31,649
And primarily, it's the
things we want out of life:

4769
03:43:31,649 --> 03:43:35,762
food, sex, companionship, power.

4770
03:43:37,680 --> 03:43:40,800
You can understand chimp
and bonobo behavior

4771
03:43:40,799 --> 03:43:45,209
in the same lights much more easily.

4772
03:43:45,209 --> 03:43:49,469
And I think doing so gives
you the tools you need

4773
03:43:49,469 --> 03:43:54,059
to reduce human behavior from
the kind of false complexity

4774
03:43:54,059 --> 03:43:56,079
that we layer onto it with language

4775
03:43:57,000 --> 03:43:58,926
and look at it in terms of,

4776
03:43:58,926 --> 03:44:02,010
oh, well, these humans are
looking for companionship,

4777
03:44:02,010 --> 03:44:03,753
sex, food, power.

4778
03:44:06,209 --> 03:44:08,639
And I think that's a pretty powerful tool

4779
03:44:08,639 --> 03:44:10,859
to have in understanding human behavior.

4780
03:44:10,860 --> 03:44:14,220
- And I just went to the
Amazon jungle for a few weeks,

4781
03:44:14,219 --> 03:44:17,489
and it's a very visceral reminder

4782
03:44:17,489 --> 03:44:21,510
that a lot of life on earth
is just trying to get laid.

4783
03:44:21,510 --> 03:44:23,013
They're all screaming at each other.

4784
03:44:23,013 --> 03:44:25,290
Like I saw a lot of monkeys,

4785
03:44:25,290 --> 03:44:26,940
and they're just trying
to impress each other,

4786
03:44:26,940 --> 03:44:29,850
or maybe if there's a battle for power,

4787
03:44:29,850 --> 03:44:31,319
but a lot of the battle for power

4788
03:44:31,319 --> 03:44:33,000
has to do with them getting laid.

4789
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:33,833
- Right.

4790
03:44:33,833 --> 03:44:37,170
Breeding rights often
go with alpha status.

4791
03:44:37,170 --> 03:44:38,729
And so if you can get a piece of that,

4792
03:44:38,729 --> 03:44:40,529
then you're gonna do okay.

4793
03:44:40,530 --> 03:44:41,363
- And would like to think

4794
03:44:41,362 --> 03:44:42,989
that we're somehow
fundamentally different,

4795
03:44:42,989 --> 03:44:45,869
but especially when it comes to primates,

4796
03:44:45,870 --> 03:44:47,760
we're really aren't, you know.

4797
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:50,069
We can use fancier poetic language,

4798
03:44:50,069 --> 03:44:53,940
but maybe some of the underlying drives

4799
03:44:53,940 --> 03:44:57,690
that motivate us are similar.

4800
03:44:57,690 --> 03:44:58,920
- Yeah, I think that's true.

4801
03:44:58,920 --> 03:45:01,649
- And all of that is coming
from this, the brain.

4802
03:45:01,649 --> 03:45:03,539
- Yeah.
- So when did you first

4803
03:45:03,540 --> 03:45:05,160
start studying the brain

4804
03:45:05,159 --> 03:45:07,020
as I guess as a biological mechanism?

4805
03:45:07,020 --> 03:45:08,670
- Basically, the moment I got to college,

4806
03:45:08,670 --> 03:45:11,190
I started looking around for labs

4807
03:45:11,190 --> 03:45:14,730
that I could do neuroscience work in.

4808
03:45:14,729 --> 03:45:17,549
I originally approached
that from the angle

4809
03:45:17,549 --> 03:45:20,456
of looking at interactions
between the brain

4810
03:45:20,457 --> 03:45:23,340
and the immune system, which
isn't the most obvious place

4811
03:45:23,340 --> 03:45:27,030
to start, but I had this idea at the time

4812
03:45:27,030 --> 03:45:32,030
that the contents of your
thoughts would have an impact,

4813
03:45:33,450 --> 03:45:36,120
a direct impact, maybe a powerful one

4814
03:45:36,120 --> 03:45:41,120
on non-conscious systems in your body.

4815
03:45:41,190 --> 03:45:44,670
The systems we think of as homeostatic,

4816
03:45:44,670 --> 03:45:48,659
automatic mechanisms like
fighting off a virus,

4817
03:45:48,659 --> 03:45:50,163
like repairing a wound.

4818
03:45:51,540 --> 03:45:55,410
And sure enough, there are big
crossovers between the two.

4819
03:45:55,409 --> 03:46:00,409
I mean, it gets to kind of a key point

4820
03:46:00,540 --> 03:46:02,100
that I think goes under recognized.

4821
03:46:02,100 --> 03:46:05,280
One of the things people don't recognize

4822
03:46:05,280 --> 03:46:08,820
or appreciate about
the human brain enough,

4823
03:46:08,819 --> 03:46:11,489
and that is that it basically controls

4824
03:46:11,489 --> 03:46:14,583
or has a huge role in almost
everything that your body does.

4825
03:46:16,469 --> 03:46:18,379
Like you try to name an example

4826
03:46:18,379 --> 03:46:22,199
of something in your body
that isn't directly controlled

4827
03:46:22,200 --> 03:46:27,200
or massively influenced by the
brain, and it's pretty hard.

4828
03:46:27,239 --> 03:46:29,459
I mean, you might say like
bone healing or something,

4829
03:46:29,459 --> 03:46:34,229
but even those systems, the
hypothalamus and pituitary

4830
03:46:34,229 --> 03:46:38,850
end up playing a role in
coordinating the endocrine system

4831
03:46:38,850 --> 03:46:41,280
that does have a direct influence on, say,

4832
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:44,489
the calcium level in your blood
that goes to bone healing.

4833
03:46:44,489 --> 03:46:47,289
So non-obvious connections
between those things

4834
03:46:48,389 --> 03:46:52,139
implicate the brain as really a potent

4835
03:46:52,139 --> 03:46:54,962
prime mover in all of health.

4836
03:46:55,799 --> 03:46:59,189
- One of the things I realized
in the other direction too,

4837
03:46:59,190 --> 03:47:02,460
how most of the systems in the body

4838
03:47:02,459 --> 03:47:03,812
integrated with the human brain,

4839
03:47:03,813 --> 03:47:07,229
like they affect the brain
also, like the immune system.

4840
03:47:07,229 --> 03:47:11,789
I think there's just people
who study Alzheimer's

4841
03:47:11,790 --> 03:47:14,640
and those kinds of things.

4842
03:47:14,639 --> 03:47:18,949
It's just surprising how
much you can understand

4843
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:21,870
of that from the immune
system, from the other systems

4844
03:47:21,870 --> 03:47:24,900
that don't obviously seem
to have anything to do

4845
03:47:24,899 --> 03:47:27,299
with sort of the nervous system.

4846
03:47:27,299 --> 03:47:28,529
They all play together.

4847
03:47:28,530 --> 03:47:30,870
- Yeah, you could
understand how that would be

4848
03:47:30,870 --> 03:47:34,680
driven by evolution too,
just in some simple examples.

4849
03:47:34,680 --> 03:47:37,440
If you get sick, if you
get a communicable disease,

4850
03:47:37,440 --> 03:47:42,440
you get the flu, it's pretty advantageous

4851
03:47:43,500 --> 03:47:45,516
for your immune system to tell your brain,

4852
03:47:45,516 --> 03:47:49,920
"Hey, now be antisocial for a few days.

4853
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:52,263
Don't go be the life of the party tonight.

4854
03:47:53,399 --> 03:47:55,829
In fact, maybe just
cuddle up somewhere warm

4855
03:47:55,829 --> 03:47:58,559
under a blanket and just
stay there for a day or two."

4856
03:47:58,559 --> 03:48:00,600
And sure enough, that
tends to be the behavior

4857
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:03,690
that you see both in
animals and in humans.

4858
03:48:03,690 --> 03:48:07,470
If you get sick, elevated
levels of interleukins

4859
03:48:07,469 --> 03:48:09,969
in your blood and TNF alpha in your blood

4860
03:48:11,340 --> 03:48:14,760
ask the brain to cut
back on social activity.

4861
03:48:14,760 --> 03:48:17,819
And even moving around,

4862
03:48:17,819 --> 03:48:21,029
you have lower locomotor activity

4863
03:48:21,030 --> 03:48:23,403
in animals that are infected with viruses.

4864
03:48:25,350 --> 03:48:30,350
- So from there, the early days
in neuroscience to surgery,

4865
03:48:31,260 --> 03:48:33,239
when did that step happen?

4866
03:48:33,239 --> 03:48:35,039
- Yeah.
- This is a leap.

4867
03:48:35,040 --> 03:48:36,660
- It was sort of an evolution of thought.

4868
03:48:36,659 --> 03:48:39,809
I wanted to study the brain.

4869
03:48:39,809 --> 03:48:42,799
I started studying the brain in undergrad

4870
03:48:42,799 --> 03:48:45,272
in this neuroimmunology lab.

4871
03:48:46,680 --> 03:48:51,569
I, from there, realized at some point

4872
03:48:51,569 --> 03:48:54,659
that I didn't wanna
just generate knowledge.

4873
03:48:54,659 --> 03:48:59,129
I wanted to effect real
changes in the actual world,

4874
03:48:59,129 --> 03:49:00,569
in actual people's lives.

4875
03:49:00,569 --> 03:49:04,079
And so after having not
really thought about

4876
03:49:04,079 --> 03:49:06,389
going into medical school,

4877
03:49:06,389 --> 03:49:09,239
I was on a track to go into a PhD program.

4878
03:49:09,239 --> 03:49:12,930
I said, "Well, I'd like that option.

4879
03:49:12,930 --> 03:49:15,340
I'd like to actually potentially help

4880
03:49:16,290 --> 03:49:18,690
tangible people in front of me."

4881
03:49:18,690 --> 03:49:23,040
And doing a little digging
found that there exists

4882
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:28,030
these MD-PhD programs where
you can choose not to choose

4883
03:49:28,979 --> 03:49:30,686
between them and do both.

4884
03:49:30,686 --> 03:49:34,709
And so I went to USC for medical school

4885
03:49:34,709 --> 03:49:37,952
and had a joint PhD program with Caltech,

4886
03:49:40,170 --> 03:49:43,860
where I actually chose
that program particularly

4887
03:49:43,860 --> 03:49:47,700
because of a researcher at
Caltech named Richard Andersen,

4888
03:49:47,700 --> 03:49:52,050
who's one of the godfathers
of primate neuroscience

4889
03:49:52,049 --> 03:49:55,289
and has a MACAC lab where Utah arrays

4890
03:49:55,290 --> 03:49:57,060
and other electrodes were being inserted

4891
03:49:57,059 --> 03:50:00,180
into the brains of monkeys
to try to understand

4892
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:03,870
how intentions were being
encoded in the brain.

4893
03:50:03,870 --> 03:50:07,079
So I ended up there with the idea

4894
03:50:07,079 --> 03:50:09,030
that maybe I would be a neurologist

4895
03:50:09,030 --> 03:50:11,073
and study the brain on the side,

4896
03:50:12,149 --> 03:50:14,252
and then discovered that neurology,

4897
03:50:15,090 --> 03:50:18,299
again, I'm gonna make
enemies by saying this,

4898
03:50:18,299 --> 03:50:22,379
but neurology predominantly

4899
03:50:22,379 --> 03:50:25,439
and distressingly to me is the practice

4900
03:50:25,440 --> 03:50:27,756
of diagnosing a thing and then saying,

4901
03:50:27,756 --> 03:50:28,799
"Good luck with that.

4902
03:50:28,799 --> 03:50:30,199
There's not much we can do."

4903
03:50:32,010 --> 03:50:34,413
And neurosurgery, very differently,

4904
03:50:36,450 --> 03:50:39,510
it's a powerful lever on taking people

4905
03:50:39,510 --> 03:50:43,139
that are headed in a bad direction
and changing their course

4906
03:50:43,139 --> 03:50:45,449
in the sense of brain tumors

4907
03:50:45,450 --> 03:50:49,233
that are potentially treatable
or curable with surgery.

4908
03:50:50,639 --> 03:50:52,619
Even aneurysms in the brain,

4909
03:50:52,620 --> 03:50:53,970
blood vessels that are gonna rupture,

4910
03:50:53,969 --> 03:50:56,309
you can save lives really

4911
03:50:56,309 --> 03:50:59,279
is at the end of the
day, what mattered to me.

4912
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:04,260
And so I was at USC, as I mentioned,

4913
03:51:04,260 --> 03:51:08,130
that happens to be one of the
great neurosurgery programs.

4914
03:51:08,129 --> 03:51:12,929
And so I met these truly
epic neurosurgeons,

4915
03:51:14,399 --> 03:51:17,729
Alex Khalessi and Mike
Apuzzo and Steve Giannotta

4916
03:51:17,729 --> 03:51:20,189
and Marty Weiss, these sort of epic people

4917
03:51:20,190 --> 03:51:22,470
that were just human
beings in front of me.

4918
03:51:22,469 --> 03:51:25,289
And so it kind of changed my thinking

4919
03:51:25,290 --> 03:51:28,770
from neurosurgeons are distant gods

4920
03:51:28,770 --> 03:51:30,659
that live on another planet

4921
03:51:30,659 --> 03:51:32,489
and occasionally come and visit us

4922
03:51:32,489 --> 03:51:36,375
to these are humans that
have problems and are people.

4923
03:51:36,375 --> 03:51:39,270
And there's nothing
fundamentally preventing me

4924
03:51:39,270 --> 03:51:40,920
from being one of them.

4925
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:45,090
And so at the last
minute in medical school,

4926
03:51:45,090 --> 03:51:48,750
I changed gears from going
into a different specialty

4927
03:51:48,750 --> 03:51:52,950
and switched into neurosurgery,
which cost me a year.

4928
03:51:52,950 --> 03:51:55,409
I had to do another year of research,

4929
03:51:55,409 --> 03:51:57,459
because I was so far along in the process

4930
03:52:00,565 --> 03:52:01,470
to switch into neurosurgery.

4931
03:52:01,469 --> 03:52:02,729
The deadlines had already passed.

4932
03:52:02,729 --> 03:52:07,199
So it was a decision that cost time,

4933
03:52:07,200 --> 03:52:09,000
but absolutely worth it.

4934
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:10,774
- What was the hardest
part of the training

4935
03:52:10,774 --> 03:52:12,842
on the neurosurgeon track?

4936
03:52:14,219 --> 03:52:16,342
- Yeah, two things.

4937
03:52:16,343 --> 03:52:19,470
I think that residency in neurosurgery

4938
03:52:19,469 --> 03:52:21,569
is sort of a competition of pain,

4939
03:52:21,569 --> 03:52:24,629
of like how much pain
can you eat and smile.

4940
03:52:24,629 --> 03:52:27,519
- Yeah.
- And so there's

4941
03:52:28,590 --> 03:52:32,042
workout restrictions that are not really,

4942
03:52:33,180 --> 03:52:34,979
they're viewed at, I think, internally

4943
03:52:34,979 --> 03:52:37,319
among the residents as weakness.

4944
03:52:37,319 --> 03:52:40,590
And so most neurosurgery residents

4945
03:52:40,590 --> 03:52:42,243
try to work as hard as they can.

4946
03:52:43,229 --> 03:52:46,319
And that I think necessarily
means working long hours,

4947
03:52:46,319 --> 03:52:48,180
and sometimes, over the work hour limits.

4948
03:52:48,180 --> 03:52:51,720
And we care about being compliant

4949
03:52:51,719 --> 03:52:54,869
with whatever regulations
are in front of us.

4950
03:52:54,870 --> 03:52:56,370
But I think more important than that,

4951
03:52:56,370 --> 03:52:58,980
people wanna give their all

4952
03:52:58,979 --> 03:53:00,600
in becoming a better neurosurgeon,

4953
03:53:00,600 --> 03:53:03,270
because the stakes are so high.

4954
03:53:03,270 --> 03:53:06,100
And so it's a real fight to get residents

4955
03:53:07,590 --> 03:53:10,380
to say go home at the end of their shift

4956
03:53:10,379 --> 03:53:12,027
and not stay and do more surgery.

4957
03:53:12,027 --> 03:53:14,909
- Are you seriously saying
like one of the hardest things

4958
03:53:14,909 --> 03:53:18,780
is literally like
forcing them to get sleep

4959
03:53:18,780 --> 03:53:20,489
and rest and all this kind of stuff?

4960
03:53:20,489 --> 03:53:22,197
- Historically, that was the case.

4961
03:53:22,197 --> 03:53:25,103
I think the next generation,

4962
03:53:25,103 --> 03:53:28,829
I think the next generation
is more compliant

4963
03:53:28,829 --> 03:53:29,950
and more selfcare-
- Weaker is what you mean.

4964
03:53:29,950 --> 03:53:32,430
All right, I'm just
kidding, I'm just kidding.

4965
03:53:32,430 --> 03:53:33,263
- I didn't say it.

4966
03:53:33,263 --> 03:53:35,070
- Now I'm making enemies.

4967
03:53:35,069 --> 03:53:35,903
Okay, I get it.

4968
03:53:35,903 --> 03:53:37,350
Wow, that's fascinating.

4969
03:53:37,350 --> 03:53:39,030
So what was the second thing?

4970
03:53:39,030 --> 03:53:40,770
- The personalities.

4971
03:53:40,770 --> 03:53:43,560
And maybe the two are connected, but-

4972
03:53:43,559 --> 03:53:45,149
- Was it pretty competitive?

4973
03:53:45,149 --> 03:53:47,132
- It's competitive and it's also,

4974
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:53,190
as we touched on earlier,
primates like power,

4975
03:53:53,190 --> 03:53:57,780
and I think neurosurgery
has long had this aura

4976
03:53:57,780 --> 03:54:02,507
of mystique and excellence
and whatever about it.

4977
03:54:02,506 --> 03:54:05,879
And so it's an invitation
I think for people

4978
03:54:05,879 --> 03:54:08,459
that are cloaked in that authority.

4979
03:54:08,459 --> 03:54:10,229
A board certified
neurosurgeon is basically

4980
03:54:10,229 --> 03:54:14,520
a walking fallacious
appeal to authority, right?

4981
03:54:14,520 --> 03:54:16,500
You have license to walk into any room

4982
03:54:16,500 --> 03:54:21,209
and act like you're an expert on whatever.

4983
03:54:21,209 --> 03:54:23,099
And fighting that tendency

4984
03:54:23,100 --> 03:54:26,460
is not something that most
neurosurgeons do well.

4985
03:54:26,459 --> 03:54:28,139
Humility isn't the forte.

4986
03:54:28,139 --> 03:54:32,159
- Yeah, so I have friends who know you,

4987
03:54:32,159 --> 03:54:33,690
and whenever they speak about you,

4988
03:54:33,690 --> 03:54:38,430
that you have the surprising quality

4989
03:54:38,430 --> 03:54:40,353
for a neurosurgeon of humility,

4990
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:44,880
which I think indicates
that it's not as common

4991
03:54:44,879 --> 03:54:46,469
as perhaps in other professions,

4992
03:54:46,469 --> 03:54:49,889
'cause there is a kind of gigantic

4993
03:54:49,889 --> 03:54:52,289
sort of heroic aspect to neurosurgery,

4994
03:54:52,290 --> 03:54:54,930
and I think it gets to
people's head a little bit.

4995
03:54:54,930 --> 03:54:55,920
- Yeah.

4996
03:54:55,920 --> 03:55:00,870
Well, I think that allows me to play well

4997
03:55:00,870 --> 03:55:02,763
at an Elon company.

4998
03:55:03,719 --> 03:55:06,689
Because Elon, one of his strengths,

4999
03:55:06,690 --> 03:55:11,460
I think, is to just instantly see through

5000
03:55:11,459 --> 03:55:13,829
fallacy from authority.

5001
03:55:13,829 --> 03:55:15,756
So nobody walks into a
room that he's in and says,

5002
03:55:15,756 --> 03:55:18,629
"Well, goddamn it, you have to trust me.

5003
03:55:18,629 --> 03:55:22,136
I'm the guy that built the
last 10 rockets or something."

5004
03:55:22,137 --> 03:55:23,550
And he says, "Well, you did it wrong

5005
03:55:23,549 --> 03:55:25,349
and we can do it better."

5006
03:55:25,350 --> 03:55:27,809
Or, "I'm the guy that kept Ford

5007
03:55:27,809 --> 03:55:29,309
alive for the last 50 years.

5008
03:55:29,309 --> 03:55:30,840
You listen to me on how to build cars."

5009
03:55:30,840 --> 03:55:32,972
And he says no.

5010
03:55:34,406 --> 03:55:36,179
And so you don't walk
into a room that he's in

5011
03:55:36,180 --> 03:55:37,620
and say, "Well, I'm a neurosurgeon.

5012
03:55:37,620 --> 03:55:39,600
Let me tell you how to do it."

5013
03:55:39,600 --> 03:55:43,530
He's gonna say, "Well, I'm a
human being that has a brain.

5014
03:55:43,530 --> 03:55:45,960
I can think from first principles myself,

5015
03:55:45,959 --> 03:55:47,639
thank you very much.

5016
03:55:47,639 --> 03:55:49,170
And here's how I think
it ought to be done.

5017
03:55:49,170 --> 03:55:51,540
Let's go try it and see who's right."

5018
03:55:51,540 --> 03:55:55,440
And that's proven I think
over and over in his case

5019
03:55:55,440 --> 03:55:56,870
to be a very powerful approach.

5020
03:55:56,870 --> 03:55:58,500
- If we just take that tangent,

5021
03:55:58,500 --> 03:56:02,969
there's a fascinating
interdisciplinary team at Neuralink

5022
03:56:02,969 --> 03:56:07,202
that you get to interact
with, including Elon.

5023
03:56:08,340 --> 03:56:11,792
What do you think is the
secret to a successful team?

5024
03:56:12,659 --> 03:56:13,559
What have you learned

5025
03:56:13,559 --> 03:56:15,609
from just getting to observe these folks?

5026
03:56:16,649 --> 03:56:19,472
World experts in different
disciplines work together.

5027
03:56:20,579 --> 03:56:25,000
- Yeah, there's a sweet
spot where people disagree

5028
03:56:27,299 --> 03:56:29,309
and forcefully speak their mind

5029
03:56:29,309 --> 03:56:31,412
and passionately defend their position,

5030
03:56:32,639 --> 03:56:36,750
and yet are still able to
accept information from others

5031
03:56:36,750 --> 03:56:40,020
and change their ideas when they're wrong.

5032
03:56:40,020 --> 03:56:42,180
And so I like the analogy

5033
03:56:42,180 --> 03:56:46,050
of sort of how you polish rocks.

5034
03:56:46,049 --> 03:56:50,579
You put hard things in a
hard container and spin it.

5035
03:56:50,579 --> 03:56:52,530
People bash against each other

5036
03:56:52,530 --> 03:56:57,120
and outcome's a more refined product.

5037
03:56:57,120 --> 03:57:01,560
And so to make a good team at Neuralink,

5038
03:57:01,559 --> 03:57:05,189
we've tried to find
people that are not afraid

5039
03:57:05,190 --> 03:57:07,260
to defend their ideas passionately.

5040
03:57:07,260 --> 03:57:12,260
And occasionally, strongly
disagree with people

5041
03:57:13,416 --> 03:57:15,840
that they're working with

5042
03:57:15,840 --> 03:57:18,632
and have the best idea come out on top.

5043
03:57:20,879 --> 03:57:23,099
It's not an easy balance, again,

5044
03:57:23,100 --> 03:57:26,370
to refer back to the primate brain.

5045
03:57:26,370 --> 03:57:28,380
It's not something that is inherently

5046
03:57:28,379 --> 03:57:30,842
built into the primate brain to say,

5047
03:57:32,197 --> 03:57:36,375
"I passionately put all
my chips on this position

5048
03:57:36,375 --> 03:57:37,950
and now I'm just gonna walk away from it.

5049
03:57:37,950 --> 03:57:39,840
Admit you were right."

5050
03:57:39,840 --> 03:57:43,889
Part of our brains tell us
that that is a power loss.

5051
03:57:43,889 --> 03:57:45,599
That is a loss of face,

5052
03:57:45,600 --> 03:57:47,844
a loss of standing in the community.

5053
03:57:47,843 --> 03:57:52,143
And now, you're a zeta chimp,

5054
03:57:53,010 --> 03:57:54,603
'cause your idea got trounced.

5055
03:57:56,159 --> 03:57:59,789
And you just have to recognize
that that little voice

5056
03:57:59,790 --> 03:58:01,410
in the back of your head is maladaptive

5057
03:58:01,409 --> 03:58:04,396
and it's not helping the team win.

5058
03:58:04,396 --> 03:58:05,460
- Yeah, you have to have the confidence

5059
03:58:05,459 --> 03:58:08,159
to be able to walk away from
an idea that you hold onto.

5060
03:58:08,159 --> 03:58:08,993
Yeah.
- Yeah.

5061
03:58:08,993 --> 03:58:11,040
- And if you do that often enough,

5062
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:13,830
you're actually going to become

5063
03:58:13,829 --> 03:58:16,229
the best in the world at your thing.

5064
03:58:16,229 --> 03:58:18,750
I mean, that kind of that rapid iteration.

5065
03:58:18,750 --> 03:58:21,352
- Yeah, you'll at least be
a member of a winning team.

5066
03:58:22,440 --> 03:58:23,763
- Ride the wave.

5067
03:58:25,170 --> 03:58:26,069
What did you learn?

5068
03:58:26,069 --> 03:58:30,409
You mentioned there's a lot of
amazing neurosurgeons at USC.

5069
03:58:30,409 --> 03:58:33,360
What lessons about surgery and life

5070
03:58:33,360 --> 03:58:35,100
have you learned from those folks?

5071
03:58:35,100 --> 03:58:40,100
- Yeah, I think working
your ass off, working hard

5072
03:58:40,139 --> 03:58:44,519
while functioning as a member of a team,

5073
03:58:44,520 --> 03:58:47,613
getting a job done that
is incredibly difficult,

5074
03:58:49,530 --> 03:58:53,460
working incredibly long
hours, being up all night,

5075
03:58:53,459 --> 03:58:55,109
taking care of someone that

5076
03:58:55,110 --> 03:58:58,710
you think probably won't
survive no matter what you do.

5077
03:58:58,709 --> 03:59:03,000
Working hard to make people
that you passionately dislike

5078
03:59:03,000 --> 03:59:05,132
look good the next morning.

5079
03:59:06,659 --> 03:59:10,200
These folks were
relentless in their pursuit

5080
03:59:10,200 --> 03:59:15,200
of excellent neurosurgical
technique decade over decade.

5081
03:59:17,513 --> 03:59:21,300
And I think we're well-recognized
for that excellence.

5082
03:59:21,299 --> 03:59:25,319
Especially Marty Weiss,
Steve Giannotta, Mike Apuzzo,

5083
03:59:25,319 --> 03:59:30,029
they made huge contributions
not only to surgical technique,

5084
03:59:30,030 --> 03:59:33,190
but they built training
programs that trained

5085
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:38,250
dozens or hundreds of
amazing neurosurgeons.

5086
03:59:38,250 --> 03:59:42,420
I was just lucky to kind
of be in their wake.

5087
03:59:42,420 --> 03:59:46,799
- What's that like, you
mentioned doing a surgery

5088
03:59:46,799 --> 03:59:51,119
where the person is likely not to survive.

5089
03:59:51,120 --> 03:59:52,443
Does that wear on you?

5090
03:59:54,180 --> 03:59:55,023
- Yeah.

5091
04:00:02,549 --> 04:00:05,582
It's especially challenging when you,

5092
04:00:10,590 --> 04:00:12,843
with all respect to our elders,

5093
04:00:13,709 --> 04:00:15,419
it doesn't hit so much

5094
04:00:15,420 --> 04:00:17,620
when you're taking care of an 80-year-old

5095
04:00:18,479 --> 04:00:23,479
and something was going to
get them pretty soon anyway.

5096
04:00:23,940 --> 04:00:27,060
And so you lose a patient like that,

5097
04:00:27,059 --> 04:00:29,549
and it was part of the natural course

5098
04:00:29,549 --> 04:00:33,932
of what is expected of them in
the coming years, regardless.

5099
04:00:36,450 --> 04:00:41,450
Taking care of a father of
two or three, four young kids,

5100
04:00:45,209 --> 04:00:49,529
someone in their 30s that
didn't have it coming,

5101
04:00:49,530 --> 04:00:52,320
and they show up in your ER

5102
04:00:52,319 --> 04:00:54,000
having their first seizure of their life,

5103
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:57,090
and lo and behold, they've
got a huge, malignant,

5104
04:00:57,090 --> 04:01:00,153
inoperable or incurable brain tumor.

5105
04:01:01,079 --> 04:01:04,659
You can only do that, I
think, a handful of times

5106
04:01:06,239 --> 04:01:09,542
before it really starts
eating away at your armor.

5107
04:01:12,304 --> 04:01:14,639
Or a young mother that shows up

5108
04:01:14,639 --> 04:01:17,760
that has a giant hemorrhage in her brain

5109
04:01:17,760 --> 04:01:19,139
that she's not gonna survive from.

5110
04:01:19,139 --> 04:01:22,709
And they bring her four-year-old daughter

5111
04:01:22,709 --> 04:01:25,019
to say goodbye one last time

5112
04:01:25,020 --> 04:01:26,819
before they turn the ventilator off.

5113
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:33,180
The great Henry Marsh is
a English neurosurgeon

5114
04:01:33,180 --> 04:01:34,013
who said it best.

5115
04:01:34,013 --> 04:01:35,790
I think he says that every neurosurgeon

5116
04:01:35,790 --> 04:01:37,560
carries with them a private graveyard,

5117
04:01:37,559 --> 04:01:39,092
and I definitely feel that,

5118
04:01:42,270 --> 04:01:43,983
especially with young parents.

5119
04:01:46,072 --> 04:01:46,905
That kills me.

5120
04:01:48,690 --> 04:01:50,313
They had a lot more to give.

5121
04:01:51,329 --> 04:01:53,879
The loss of those people specifically

5122
04:01:53,879 --> 04:01:58,879
has a knock on effect that's
going to make the world worse

5123
04:01:59,790 --> 04:02:03,330
for people for a long time.

5124
04:02:03,329 --> 04:02:07,143
And it's just hard to feel
powerless in the face of that.

5125
04:02:09,329 --> 04:02:14,329
And that's where I think you
have to be borderline evil

5126
04:02:15,479 --> 04:02:18,180
to fight against a company like Neuralink

5127
04:02:18,180 --> 04:02:21,870
or to constantly be taking pot shots at us

5128
04:02:21,870 --> 04:02:26,870
because what we're doing is
to try to fix that stuff.

5129
04:02:27,389 --> 04:02:29,222
We're trying to give people options,

5130
04:02:30,659 --> 04:02:32,612
to reduce suffering.

5131
04:02:34,881 --> 04:02:38,250
We're trying to take the pain out of life

5132
04:02:38,250 --> 04:02:43,250
that broken brains brings in.

5133
04:02:43,620 --> 04:02:48,450
And yeah, this is just our little way

5134
04:02:48,450 --> 04:02:51,333
that we're fighting back
against entropy, I guess.

5135
04:02:52,469 --> 04:02:55,349
- Yeah, the amount of
suffering that's endured

5136
04:02:55,350 --> 04:02:58,590
when some of the things
that we take for granted

5137
04:02:58,590 --> 04:03:02,579
that our brain is able to
do is taken away is immense.

5138
04:03:02,579 --> 04:03:03,780
And to be able to restore

5139
04:03:03,780 --> 04:03:06,390
some of that functionality is a real gift.

5140
04:03:06,389 --> 04:03:08,119
- Yeah, we're just starting.

5141
04:03:08,120 --> 04:03:09,993
We're gonna do so much more.

5142
04:03:11,879 --> 04:03:14,279
- Well, can you take me
through the full procedure

5143
04:03:14,280 --> 04:03:18,989
of implanting, say, the
N1 chip in Neuralink?

5144
04:03:18,989 --> 04:03:20,879
- Yeah, it's a really simple,

5145
04:03:20,879 --> 04:03:23,438
really simple, straightforward procedure.

5146
04:03:23,438 --> 04:03:28,438
The human part of the surgery
that I do is dead simple.

5147
04:03:29,909 --> 04:03:31,379
It's one of the most basic

5148
04:03:31,379 --> 04:03:34,529
neurosurgery procedures imaginable.

5149
04:03:34,530 --> 04:03:37,860
And I think there's evidence
that some version of it

5150
04:03:37,860 --> 04:03:40,800
has been done for thousands of years.

5151
04:03:40,799 --> 04:03:44,129
That there are examples I
think from ancient Egypt

5152
04:03:44,129 --> 04:03:48,876
of healed or partially healed
trephinations from Peru

5153
04:03:50,190 --> 04:03:53,520
or ancient times in South America

5154
04:03:53,520 --> 04:03:57,149
where these protosurgeons

5155
04:03:57,149 --> 04:03:59,909
would drill holes in people's skulls,

5156
04:03:59,909 --> 04:04:01,979
presumably to let out the evil spirits,

5157
04:04:01,979 --> 04:04:04,229
but maybe to drain blood clots.

5158
04:04:04,229 --> 04:04:06,779
And there's evidence of bone
healing around the edge,

5159
04:04:06,780 --> 04:04:08,310
meaning the people at least survive

5160
04:04:08,309 --> 04:04:11,636
some months after a procedure.

5161
04:04:11,637 --> 04:04:13,320
And so what we're doing is that.

5162
04:04:13,319 --> 04:04:16,559
We are making a cut in the
skin on the top of the head

5163
04:04:16,559 --> 04:04:20,439
over the area of the brain
that is the most potent

5164
04:04:21,329 --> 04:04:25,047
representation of hand intentions.

5165
04:04:25,047 --> 04:04:30,047
And so if you are an
expert concert pianist,

5166
04:04:31,049 --> 04:04:33,000
this part of your brain is lighting up

5167
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:34,549
the entire time you're playing.

5168
04:04:35,459 --> 04:04:36,899
We call it the hand knob.

5169
04:04:36,899 --> 04:04:38,190
- The hand knob.
- Yeah.

5170
04:04:38,190 --> 04:04:40,173
- So it's all like the finger movement.

5171
04:04:41,520 --> 04:04:43,500
All of that is just firing away.

5172
04:04:43,500 --> 04:04:46,139
- Yep, there's a little squiggle
in the cortex right there.

5173
04:04:46,139 --> 04:04:47,369
One of the folds in the brain

5174
04:04:47,370 --> 04:04:50,520
is kind of doubly folded
right on that spot.

5175
04:04:50,520 --> 04:04:53,647
So you can look at it on an MRI and say,

5176
04:04:53,647 --> 04:04:55,320
"That's the hand knob."

5177
04:04:55,319 --> 04:04:57,209
And then you do a functional test

5178
04:04:57,209 --> 04:05:02,159
and a special kind of MRI called
an a functional MRI, fMRI.

5179
04:05:02,159 --> 04:05:04,500
And this part of the brain
lights up when people,

5180
04:05:04,500 --> 04:05:06,569
even quadriplegic people whose brains

5181
04:05:06,569 --> 04:05:08,610
aren't connected to their
finger movements anymore.

5182
04:05:08,610 --> 04:05:10,980
They imagine finger movements,

5183
04:05:10,979 --> 04:05:13,260
and this part of the
brain still lights up.

5184
04:05:13,260 --> 04:05:16,200
So we can ID that part of the brain

5185
04:05:16,200 --> 04:05:21,200
in anyone who's preparing
to enter our trial and say,

5186
04:05:21,426 --> 04:05:23,850
"Okay, that part of the brain, we confirm,

5187
04:05:23,850 --> 04:05:25,977
is your hand intention area."

5188
04:05:27,600 --> 04:05:30,899
And so I'll make a little cut in the skin,

5189
04:05:30,899 --> 04:05:33,180
we'll flap the skin open,

5190
04:05:33,180 --> 04:05:35,190
just like kind of opening
the hood of a car,

5191
04:05:35,190 --> 04:05:36,363
only a lot smaller.

5192
04:05:37,200 --> 04:05:42,200
Make a perfectly round one inch
diameter hole in the skull,

5193
04:05:43,440 --> 04:05:45,003
remove that bit of skull,

5194
04:05:46,590 --> 04:05:49,559
open the lining of the brain,
the covering of the brain.

5195
04:05:49,559 --> 04:05:53,222
It's like a little bag of
water that the brain floats in.

5196
04:05:54,090 --> 04:05:57,872
And then show that part
of the brain to our robot.

5197
04:05:59,250 --> 04:06:01,079
And then this is where the robot shines.

5198
04:06:01,079 --> 04:06:04,382
It can come in and take these tiny,

5199
04:06:05,579 --> 04:06:08,579
much smaller than human hair electrodes

5200
04:06:08,579 --> 04:06:12,270
and precisely insert them into the cortex,

5201
04:06:12,270 --> 04:06:16,710
into the surface of the brain
to a very precise depth,

5202
04:06:16,709 --> 04:06:19,799
in a very precise spot that
avoids all the blood vessels

5203
04:06:19,799 --> 04:06:22,379
that are coating the surface of the brain.

5204
04:06:22,379 --> 04:06:24,000
And after the robot's done with its part,

5205
04:06:24,000 --> 04:06:28,409
then the human comes back
in and puts the implant

5206
04:06:28,409 --> 04:06:32,159
into that hole in the
skull and covers it up,

5207
04:06:32,159 --> 04:06:33,479
screwing it down to the skull

5208
04:06:33,479 --> 04:06:35,972
and sewing the skin back together.

5209
04:06:37,547 --> 04:06:39,750
So the whole thing is a few hours long.

5210
04:06:39,750 --> 04:06:44,750
It's extremely low risk compared
to the average neurosurgery

5211
04:06:45,149 --> 04:06:47,489
involving the brain that might say,

5212
04:06:47,489 --> 04:06:49,139
open up a deep part of the brain

5213
04:06:49,139 --> 04:06:53,129
or manipulate blood vessels in the brain.

5214
04:06:53,129 --> 04:06:55,893
This opening on the surface of the brain,

5215
04:06:58,620 --> 04:07:01,290
with only cortical micro insertions,

5216
04:07:01,290 --> 04:07:04,980
carries significantly less risk

5217
04:07:04,979 --> 04:07:09,359
than a lot of the tumor
or aneurysm surgeries

5218
04:07:09,360 --> 04:07:10,739
that are routinely done.

5219
04:07:10,739 --> 04:07:13,559
- So cortical micro
insertions that are via robot

5220
04:07:13,559 --> 04:07:18,119
and computer vision are designed
to avoid the blood vessels.

5221
04:07:18,120 --> 04:07:18,990
- Exactly.

5222
04:07:18,989 --> 04:07:21,239
- So I know you're a bit biased here,

5223
04:07:21,239 --> 04:07:23,590
but let's compare human and machine.

5224
04:07:23,590 --> 04:07:26,250
- Sure.
- So what are human

5225
04:07:26,250 --> 04:07:29,040
surgeons able to do well,

5226
04:07:29,040 --> 04:07:32,440
and what are robot
surgeons able to do well

5227
04:07:33,840 --> 04:07:36,960
at this stage of our human
civilization development?

5228
04:07:36,959 --> 04:07:38,912
- Yeah, yeah, that's a good question.

5229
04:07:39,780 --> 04:07:44,520
Humans are general purpose machines.

5230
04:07:44,520 --> 04:07:48,270
We're able to adapt to unusual situations.

5231
04:07:48,270 --> 04:07:50,319
We're able to change the plan on the fly.

5232
04:07:53,250 --> 04:07:58,229
I remember well a surgery that
I was doing many years ago

5233
04:07:58,229 --> 04:08:03,229
down in San Diego, where the
plan was to open a small hole

5234
04:08:04,649 --> 04:08:08,670
behind the ear and go
reposition a blood vessel

5235
04:08:08,670 --> 04:08:11,309
that had come to lay on the facial nerve,

5236
04:08:11,309 --> 04:08:15,090
the trigeminal nerve, the
nerve that goes to the face.

5237
04:08:15,090 --> 04:08:17,340
When that blood vessel lays on the nerve,

5238
04:08:17,340 --> 04:08:21,750
it can cause just intolerable,
horrific shooting pain

5239
04:08:21,750 --> 04:08:25,110
that people describe like being
zapped with a cattle prod.

5240
04:08:25,110 --> 04:08:26,819
And so the beautiful, elegant surgery

5241
04:08:26,819 --> 04:08:30,899
is to go move this blood
vessel off the nerve.

5242
04:08:30,899 --> 04:08:33,629
The surgery team, we went in there

5243
04:08:33,629 --> 04:08:35,369
and started moving this blood vessel

5244
04:08:35,370 --> 04:08:37,530
and then found that there
was a giant aneurysm

5245
04:08:37,530 --> 04:08:40,140
on that blood vessel that
was not easily visible

5246
04:08:40,139 --> 04:08:41,879
on the pre-op scans.

5247
04:08:41,879 --> 04:08:44,396
And so the plan had to dynamically change,

5248
04:08:44,397 --> 04:08:48,330
and the human surgeons
had no problem with that.

5249
04:08:48,329 --> 04:08:50,610
We're trained for all those things.

5250
04:08:50,610 --> 04:08:53,610
Robots wouldn't do so
well in that situation,

5251
04:08:53,610 --> 04:08:55,773
at least in their current incarnation,

5252
04:08:56,670 --> 04:08:58,020
fully robotic surgery,

5253
04:08:58,020 --> 04:09:01,319
like the electrode insertion portion

5254
04:09:01,319 --> 04:09:04,289
of the Neuralink surgery.

5255
04:09:04,290 --> 04:09:06,360
It goes according to a set plan.

5256
04:09:06,360 --> 04:09:09,840
And so the humans can interrupt the flow

5257
04:09:09,840 --> 04:09:12,090
and change the plan, but the robot

5258
04:09:12,090 --> 04:09:14,250
can't really change the
plan midway through.

5259
04:09:14,250 --> 04:09:18,149
It operates according
to how it was programmed

5260
04:09:18,149 --> 04:09:19,500
and how it was asked to run.

5261
04:09:19,500 --> 04:09:23,250
It does its job very precisely,

5262
04:09:23,250 --> 04:09:26,309
but not with a wide degree of latitude

5263
04:09:26,309 --> 04:09:29,369
and how to react to changing conditions.

5264
04:09:29,370 --> 04:09:31,829
- So there could be just a
very large number of ways

5265
04:09:31,829 --> 04:09:33,539
that you could be surprised as a surgeon

5266
04:09:33,540 --> 04:09:36,420
when you enter a situation
that could be subtle things

5267
04:09:36,420 --> 04:09:38,520
that you have to dynamically adjust to.

5268
04:09:38,520 --> 04:09:40,120
- Correct.
- And robots are not

5269
04:09:41,280 --> 04:09:42,540
good at that.

5270
04:09:42,540 --> 04:09:44,160
- Currently.
- Currently.

5271
04:09:44,159 --> 04:09:49,159
I think we are at the
dawn of a new era with AI

5272
04:09:49,379 --> 04:09:54,269
of the parameters for robot responsiveness

5273
04:09:54,270 --> 04:09:56,783
to be dramatically broadened, right?

5274
04:09:56,782 --> 04:09:59,969
I mean, you can't look
at a self-driving car

5275
04:09:59,969 --> 04:10:03,813
and say that it's operating
under very narrow parameters.

5276
04:10:05,309 --> 04:10:07,350
If a chicken runs across the road,

5277
04:10:07,350 --> 04:10:10,050
it wasn't necessarily
programmed to deal with that,

5278
04:10:10,049 --> 04:10:14,340
specifically, but a Waymo
or a self-driving Tesla

5279
04:10:14,340 --> 04:10:17,760
would have no problem reacting
to that appropriately.

5280
04:10:17,760 --> 04:10:22,760
And so surgical robots aren't
there yet, but give it time.

5281
04:10:23,579 --> 04:10:24,989
- And then there could be a lot of,

5282
04:10:24,989 --> 04:10:27,420
sort of into like
semi-autonomous possibilities

5283
04:10:27,420 --> 04:10:32,340
of maybe a robotic surgeon could say,

5284
04:10:32,340 --> 04:10:34,799
this situation is perfectly familiar,

5285
04:10:34,799 --> 04:10:36,989
or the situation is not familiar.

5286
04:10:36,989 --> 04:10:39,899
And in the not familiar case,
a human could take over.

5287
04:10:39,899 --> 04:10:43,386
But basically like be very
conservative in saying,

5288
04:10:43,387 --> 04:10:46,620
"Okay, this for sure has
no issues, no surprises,

5289
04:10:46,620 --> 04:10:48,780
and let the humans deal
with the surprises,

5290
04:10:48,780 --> 04:10:50,329
with the edge cases, all that."

5291
04:10:51,479 --> 04:10:52,439
That's one possibility.

5292
04:10:52,440 --> 04:10:57,440
So you think eventually,
you'll be out of the job?

5293
04:10:58,920 --> 04:11:00,899
Well, you being neurosurgeon,

5294
04:11:00,899 --> 04:11:02,159
your job being neurosurgeon.

5295
04:11:02,159 --> 04:11:05,280
Humans, there will not
be many neurosurgeons

5296
04:11:05,280 --> 04:11:06,659
left on this earth.

5297
04:11:06,659 --> 04:11:09,239
- I'm not worried about my job

5298
04:11:09,239 --> 04:11:11,583
in the course of my professional life.

5299
04:11:12,659 --> 04:11:16,079
I think I would tell my
my kids not necessarily

5300
04:11:16,079 --> 04:11:17,799
to go in this line of work

5301
04:11:20,760 --> 04:11:24,239
depending on how things look in 20 years.

5302
04:11:24,239 --> 04:11:26,280
- It's so fascinating, 'cause I mean,

5303
04:11:26,280 --> 04:11:29,250
if I have a line of work, I
would say it's programming.

5304
04:11:29,250 --> 04:11:33,239
And if you ask me like for the
last, I don't know, 20 years,

5305
04:11:33,239 --> 04:11:34,920
what I would recommend for people,

5306
04:11:34,920 --> 04:11:36,513
I would tell 'em, yeah, go.

5307
04:11:37,350 --> 04:11:39,360
You will always have a job
if you're a programmer,

5308
04:11:39,360 --> 04:11:40,560
'cause there's more and more computers

5309
04:11:40,559 --> 04:11:43,412
and all this kind of
stuff and it pays well.

5310
04:11:44,700 --> 04:11:47,400
But then you realize these
large language models

5311
04:11:47,399 --> 04:11:50,399
come along and they're really
damn good at generating code.

5312
04:11:50,399 --> 04:11:52,596
So overnight, you could be surprised like,

5313
04:11:52,596 --> 04:11:55,469
"Wow, like what is the
contribution of the human really?"

5314
04:11:55,469 --> 04:11:56,646
But then you start to think,

5315
04:11:56,647 --> 04:12:00,630
"Okay, it does seem like
humans have ability,

5316
04:12:00,629 --> 04:12:03,269
like you said, to deal
with novel situations."

5317
04:12:03,270 --> 04:12:06,030
In the case of programming,
it's the ability

5318
04:12:06,030 --> 04:12:11,030
to kinda come up with novel
ideas to solve problems.

5319
04:12:12,479 --> 04:12:16,049
It seems like machines aren't
quite yet able to do that.

5320
04:12:16,049 --> 04:12:17,489
And when the stakes are very high,

5321
04:12:17,489 --> 04:12:20,610
when it's life critical,
as it is in surgery,

5322
04:12:20,610 --> 04:12:22,023
especially in neurosurgery,

5323
04:12:25,070 --> 04:12:26,370
the stakes are very high

5324
04:12:26,370 --> 04:12:28,290
for a robot to actually replace a human.

5325
04:12:28,290 --> 04:12:31,590
But it's fascinating that
in this case of Neuralink,

5326
04:12:31,590 --> 04:12:34,290
there's a human-robot collaboration.

5327
04:12:34,290 --> 04:12:36,070
- Yeah, yeah.

5328
04:12:36,069 --> 04:12:37,529
I do the parts it can't do,

5329
04:12:37,530 --> 04:12:39,180
and it does the parts I can't do.

5330
04:12:40,131 --> 04:12:41,673
And we are friends.

5331
04:12:41,674 --> 04:12:44,257
(Lex laughing)

5332
04:12:45,389 --> 04:12:49,319
- I saw that there's a
lot of practice going on.

5333
04:12:49,319 --> 04:12:51,231
So I mean, everything in Neuralink

5334
04:12:51,231 --> 04:12:54,149
is tested extremely rigorously.

5335
04:12:54,149 --> 04:12:56,699
But one of the things I
saw, that there's a proxy

5336
04:12:56,700 --> 04:12:58,770
on which the surgeries are performed.

5337
04:12:58,770 --> 04:12:59,819
- Yeah.
- So this is both

5338
04:12:59,819 --> 04:13:02,279
for the robot and for the human,

5339
04:13:02,280 --> 04:13:05,070
for everybody involved
in the entire pipeline.

5340
04:13:05,069 --> 04:13:07,409
What's that like practicing the surgery?

5341
04:13:07,409 --> 04:13:09,569
- It's pretty intense.

5342
04:13:09,569 --> 04:13:14,569
So there's no analog to
this in human surgery.

5343
04:13:14,940 --> 04:13:18,090
Human surgery is sort
of this artisanal craft

5344
04:13:18,090 --> 04:13:19,500
that's handed down directly

5345
04:13:19,500 --> 04:13:23,309
from master to pupil over the generations.

5346
04:13:23,309 --> 04:13:25,469
I mean, literally the way you learn

5347
04:13:25,469 --> 04:13:30,469
to be a surgeon on humans is
by doing surgery on humans.

5348
04:13:30,989 --> 04:13:33,190
I mean, first, you watch

5349
04:13:34,889 --> 04:13:38,069
your professors do a bunch of surgery,

5350
04:13:38,069 --> 04:13:40,350
and then finally, they
put the trivial parts

5351
04:13:40,350 --> 04:13:42,090
of the surgery into your hands,

5352
04:13:42,090 --> 04:13:43,770
and then the more complex parts.

5353
04:13:43,770 --> 04:13:46,436
And as your understanding of the point

5354
04:13:46,436 --> 04:13:49,229
and the purposes of the surgery increases,

5355
04:13:49,229 --> 04:13:52,199
you get more responsibility
in the perfect condition.

5356
04:13:52,200 --> 04:13:53,820
Doesn't always go well.

5357
04:13:53,819 --> 04:13:57,032
In Neuralink's case, the
approach is a bit different.

5358
04:13:58,950 --> 04:14:02,940
We, of course, practiced as
far as we could on animals.

5359
04:14:02,940 --> 04:14:04,893
We did hundreds of animal surgeries.

5360
04:14:06,659 --> 04:14:10,083
And when it came time
to do the first human,

5361
04:14:10,950 --> 04:14:14,920
we had just amazing
team of engineers build

5362
04:14:16,139 --> 04:14:18,420
incredibly lifelike models.

5363
04:14:18,420 --> 04:14:21,059
One of the engineers, Fran
Romano, in particular built

5364
04:14:21,059 --> 04:14:26,059
a pulsating brain in a
custom 3D printed skull

5365
04:14:26,430 --> 04:14:30,032
that matches exactly
the patient's anatomy,

5366
04:14:30,870 --> 04:14:35,490
including their face and
scalp characteristics.

5367
04:14:35,489 --> 04:14:38,932
And so when I was able to practice that,

5368
04:14:38,933 --> 04:14:42,940
I mean, it's as close as it
really reasonably should get

5369
04:14:45,510 --> 04:14:48,360
to being the real thing
and all the details,

5370
04:14:48,360 --> 04:14:52,409
including the having a mannequin body

5371
04:14:52,409 --> 04:14:54,809
attached to this custom head.

5372
04:14:54,809 --> 04:14:56,909
And so when we were doing
the practice surgeries,

5373
04:14:56,909 --> 04:15:01,079
we'd wheel that body into the CT scanner

5374
04:15:01,079 --> 04:15:04,739
and take a mock CT scan
and wheel it back in

5375
04:15:04,739 --> 04:15:08,856
and conduct all the normal
safety checks verbally.

5376
04:15:08,856 --> 04:15:12,209
"Stop, this patient, we're
confirming his identification,

5377
04:15:12,209 --> 04:15:15,599
is mannequin number blah, blah, blah."

5378
04:15:15,600 --> 04:15:18,750
And then opening the brain
in exactly the right spot

5379
04:15:18,750 --> 04:15:23,340
using standard operative
neuronavigation equipment,

5380
04:15:23,340 --> 04:15:26,190
standard surgical drills in the same OR

5381
04:15:26,190 --> 04:15:29,700
that we do all of our practice
surgeries in at Neuralink.

5382
04:15:29,700 --> 04:15:33,659
And having the skull open
and have the brain pulse,

5383
04:15:33,659 --> 04:15:35,969
which adds a degree of
difficulty for the robot

5384
04:15:35,969 --> 04:15:40,519
to perfectly precisely plan
and insert those electrodes

5385
04:15:40,520 --> 04:15:43,233
to the right depth and location.

5386
04:15:44,190 --> 04:15:49,170
And so yeah, we kind of broke new ground

5387
04:15:49,170 --> 04:15:52,590
on how extensively we
practiced for this surgery.

5388
04:15:52,590 --> 04:15:55,440
- So there was a historic moment,

5389
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:57,040
a big milestone for Neuralink

5390
04:15:58,770 --> 04:16:03,270
in part for humanity with the first human

5391
04:16:03,270 --> 04:16:06,600
getting a Neuralink implant
in January of this year.

5392
04:16:06,600 --> 04:16:11,159
Take me through the surgery on Noland.

5393
04:16:11,159 --> 04:16:12,959
What did it feel like to be part of this?

5394
04:16:12,959 --> 04:16:14,129
- Yeah.

5395
04:16:14,129 --> 04:16:18,479
Well, we're lucky to have
just incredible partners

5396
04:16:18,479 --> 04:16:20,189
at the Barrow Neurologic Institute.

5397
04:16:20,190 --> 04:16:23,730
They are, I think, the premier

5398
04:16:23,729 --> 04:16:25,653
neurosurgical hospital in the world.

5399
04:16:29,399 --> 04:16:32,430
They made everything as easy as possible

5400
04:16:32,430 --> 04:16:37,139
for the trial to get going
and helped us immensely

5401
04:16:37,139 --> 04:16:41,819
with their expertise on
how to arrange the details.

5402
04:16:41,819 --> 04:16:46,199
It was a much more high
pressure surgery in some ways.

5403
04:16:46,200 --> 04:16:50,490
I mean, even though the
outcome wasn't particularly

5404
04:16:50,489 --> 04:16:53,913
in question in terms of
our participant safety,

5405
04:16:54,959 --> 04:16:59,189
the number of observers,
the number of people,

5406
04:16:59,190 --> 04:17:01,290
there's conference rooms full of people

5407
04:17:01,290 --> 04:17:03,453
watching live streams in the hospital,

5408
04:17:04,799 --> 04:17:06,659
rooting for this to go perfectly,

5409
04:17:06,659 --> 04:17:09,809
and that just adds pressure
that is not typical

5410
04:17:09,809 --> 04:17:14,809
for even the most intense
production neurosurgery.

5411
04:17:15,930 --> 04:17:18,600
Say, removing a tumor or placing

5412
04:17:18,600 --> 04:17:21,030
deep brain stimulation electrodes.

5413
04:17:21,030 --> 04:17:23,159
And it had never been
done on a human before.

5414
04:17:23,159 --> 04:17:25,112
There were unknown unknowns.

5415
04:17:27,329 --> 04:17:32,329
And so definitely, a
moderate pucker factor there

5416
04:17:33,899 --> 04:17:35,699
for the whole team,

5417
04:17:35,700 --> 04:17:38,909
not knowing if we were going to encounter,

5418
04:17:38,909 --> 04:17:43,909
say, a degree of brain
movement that was unanticipated

5419
04:17:44,790 --> 04:17:48,360
or a degree of brain
sag that took the brain

5420
04:17:48,360 --> 04:17:51,870
far away from the skull and
made it difficult to insert

5421
04:17:51,870 --> 04:17:54,690
or some other unknown unknown problem.

5422
04:17:54,690 --> 04:17:57,000
Fortunately, everything went well

5423
04:17:57,000 --> 04:18:01,200
and that surgery is one of the smoothest

5424
04:18:01,200 --> 04:18:03,150
outcomes we could have imagined.

5425
04:18:03,149 --> 04:18:04,049
- Were you nervous?

5426
04:18:04,049 --> 04:18:06,029
I mean, you're a bit quarterback

5427
04:18:06,030 --> 04:18:07,739
in the Super Bowl kind of situation.

5428
04:18:07,739 --> 04:18:09,719
- Extremely nervous.

5429
04:18:09,719 --> 04:18:10,979
Extremely.

5430
04:18:10,979 --> 04:18:12,656
I was very pleased when it went well

5431
04:18:12,656 --> 04:18:13,982
and when it was over.

5432
04:18:15,030 --> 04:18:17,550
Looking forward to number two.
- Yeah.

5433
04:18:17,549 --> 04:18:19,096
Even with all that practice, all of that,

5434
04:18:19,096 --> 04:18:21,659
you've never been in a situation

5435
04:18:21,659 --> 04:18:24,389
that's still high stakes in
terms of people watching.

5436
04:18:24,389 --> 04:18:26,459
And we should also probably mention,

5437
04:18:26,459 --> 04:18:28,772
given how the media
works, a lot of people,

5438
04:18:31,319 --> 04:18:35,209
maybe in a dark kind of way,
hoping it doesn't go well.

5439
04:18:35,209 --> 04:18:37,869
- Well, I think wealth is easy to hate

5440
04:18:39,299 --> 04:18:41,189
or envy or whatever.

5441
04:18:41,190 --> 04:18:46,190
And I think there's a whole
industry around driving clicks,

5442
04:18:48,510 --> 04:18:50,940
and bad news is great for clicks.

5443
04:18:50,940 --> 04:18:55,940
And so any way to take an
event and turn it into bad news

5444
04:18:57,030 --> 04:19:00,090
is gonna be really good for clicks.

5445
04:19:00,090 --> 04:19:03,450
- It just sucks because I think
it puts pressure on people.

5446
04:19:03,450 --> 04:19:07,140
It discourages people from trying to solve

5447
04:19:07,139 --> 04:19:09,299
really hard problems, because
to solve hard problems,

5448
04:19:09,299 --> 04:19:10,590
you have to go into the unknown.

5449
04:19:10,590 --> 04:19:13,170
You have to do things that
haven't been done before,

5450
04:19:13,170 --> 04:19:14,909
and you have to take risks.

5451
04:19:14,909 --> 04:19:16,649
- Yeah.
- Calculated risks.

5452
04:19:16,649 --> 04:19:18,420
You have to do all kinds
of safety precautions,

5453
04:19:18,420 --> 04:19:19,979
but risks nevertheless.

5454
04:19:19,979 --> 04:19:23,659
And I just wish there would
be more celebration of that,

5455
04:19:23,659 --> 04:19:27,194
of the risk taking versus
like people just waiting

5456
04:19:27,194 --> 04:19:30,840
on the sidelines, like
waiting for failure,

5457
04:19:30,840 --> 04:19:33,059
and then pointing out the failure.

5458
04:19:33,059 --> 04:19:33,899
Yeah, it sucks.

5459
04:19:33,899 --> 04:19:37,289
But in this case, it's
really great that everything

5460
04:19:37,290 --> 04:19:38,430
went just flawlessly,

5461
04:19:38,430 --> 04:19:41,520
but it's unnecessary
pressure, I would say.

5462
04:19:41,520 --> 04:19:46,050
- Now that there's a human
with literal skin in the game,

5463
04:19:46,049 --> 04:19:48,599
there's a participant whose wellbeing

5464
04:19:48,600 --> 04:19:49,770
rides on this doing well,

5465
04:19:49,770 --> 04:19:52,409
you have to be a pretty bad person

5466
04:19:52,409 --> 04:19:54,159
to be rooting for that to go wrong.

5467
04:19:55,290 --> 04:19:58,530
And so hopefully, people
look in the mirror

5468
04:19:58,530 --> 04:20:00,123
and realize that at some point.

5469
04:20:01,620 --> 04:20:04,380
- So did you get to
actually front row seat

5470
04:20:04,379 --> 04:20:05,852
like watch the robot work?

5471
04:20:07,235 --> 04:20:08,250
You get to see the whole thing?

5472
04:20:08,250 --> 04:20:13,250
- Yeah, I mean, because an
MD needs to be in charge

5473
04:20:13,290 --> 04:20:15,060
of all of the medical decision making

5474
04:20:15,059 --> 04:20:20,059
throughout the process, I
unscrubbed from the surgery

5475
04:20:20,760 --> 04:20:23,159
after exposing the brain and
presenting it to the robot

5476
04:20:23,159 --> 04:20:28,159
and placed the targets on the robot

5477
04:20:29,879 --> 04:20:32,189
software interface that tells the robot

5478
04:20:32,190 --> 04:20:35,470
where it's going to insert
each thread that was done

5479
04:20:36,420 --> 04:20:39,899
with my hand on the mouse,
for whatever that's worth.

5480
04:20:39,899 --> 04:20:41,520
- So you were the one placing the targets?

5481
04:20:41,520 --> 04:20:43,620
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

5482
04:20:43,620 --> 04:20:48,620
So like the robot with a computer vision

5483
04:20:48,959 --> 04:20:50,069
provides a bunch of candidates

5484
04:20:50,069 --> 04:20:52,529
and you kinda finalize the decision.

5485
04:20:52,530 --> 04:20:53,363
- Right.

5486
04:20:55,105 --> 04:20:57,629
The software engineers
are amazing on this team.

5487
04:20:57,629 --> 04:21:01,139
And so they actually provided an interface

5488
04:21:01,139 --> 04:21:04,199
where you can essentially use a lasso tool

5489
04:21:04,200 --> 04:21:08,490
and select a prime area
of brain real estate,

5490
04:21:08,489 --> 04:21:11,219
and it will automatically
avoid the blood vessels

5491
04:21:11,219 --> 04:21:14,760
in that region and automatically
place a bunch of targets.

5492
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:19,290
So that allows the human robot operator

5493
04:21:19,290 --> 04:21:22,770
to select really good areas of brain

5494
04:21:22,770 --> 04:21:27,770
and make dense applications
of targets in those regions,

5495
04:21:28,079 --> 04:21:30,000
the regions we think are gonna have

5496
04:21:30,000 --> 04:21:34,170
the most high fidelity representations

5497
04:21:34,170 --> 04:21:37,889
of finger movements and
arm movement intentions.

5498
04:21:37,889 --> 04:21:39,539
- I've seen like images of this.

5499
04:21:39,540 --> 04:21:40,863
And for me, with OCD,

5500
04:21:40,862 --> 04:21:43,920
it's for some reason a really pleasant,

5501
04:21:43,920 --> 04:21:46,500
I think there's a subreddit
called oddly satisfying.

5502
04:21:46,500 --> 04:21:48,483
- [Matthew] Yeah, love that subreddit.

5503
04:21:49,590 --> 04:21:52,110
- It's oddly satisfying to
see the different target sites

5504
04:21:52,110 --> 04:21:56,190
avoiding the blood vessels
and also maximizing

5505
04:21:56,190 --> 04:21:59,210
like the usefulness of those
locations for the signal.

5506
04:21:59,209 --> 04:22:00,485
It just feels good.

5507
04:22:00,486 --> 04:22:01,685
It's like, ah.

5508
04:22:01,684 --> 04:22:03,959
- As a person who has a visceral reaction

5509
04:22:03,959 --> 04:22:04,859
to the brain bleeding,

5510
04:22:04,860 --> 04:22:07,890
I can tell you it's extremely satisfying

5511
04:22:07,889 --> 04:22:09,930
watching the electrodes
themselves go into the brain

5512
04:22:09,930 --> 04:22:11,132
and not cause bleeding.

5513
04:22:12,090 --> 04:22:13,500
- Yeah, yeah.

5514
04:22:13,500 --> 04:22:16,829
So you said the feeling was of relief

5515
04:22:16,829 --> 04:22:18,840
when everything went perfectly.

5516
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:20,430
- Yeah.

5517
04:22:20,430 --> 04:22:24,600
- How deep in the brain
can you currently go

5518
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:29,579
and eventually go, let's
say, on the Neuralink side.

5519
04:22:29,579 --> 04:22:32,129
It seems the deeper you go in the brain,

5520
04:22:32,129 --> 04:22:34,619
the more challenging it becomes.

5521
04:22:34,620 --> 04:22:38,250
- Yeah, so talking broadly
about neurosurgery,

5522
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:39,250
we can get anywhere.

5523
04:22:40,559 --> 04:22:44,079
It's routine for me to put deep
brain stimulating electrodes

5524
04:22:45,360 --> 04:22:47,853
near the very bottom of the brain,

5525
04:22:48,930 --> 04:22:51,450
entering from the top and passing

5526
04:22:51,450 --> 04:22:53,490
about a two millimeter wire

5527
04:22:53,489 --> 04:22:55,671
all the way into the bottom of the brain.

5528
04:22:55,671 --> 04:22:57,540
And that's not revolutionary.

5529
04:22:57,540 --> 04:22:58,740
A lot of people do that.

5530
04:22:59,579 --> 04:23:01,559
And we can do that with
very high precision.

5531
04:23:01,559 --> 04:23:06,100
I use a robot from
Globus to do that surgery

5532
04:23:08,700 --> 04:23:09,813
several times a month.

5533
04:23:10,829 --> 04:23:12,539
It's pretty routine.

5534
04:23:12,540 --> 04:23:14,550
- What are your eyes in that situation?

5535
04:23:14,549 --> 04:23:15,752
What are you seeing?

5536
04:23:16,680 --> 04:23:18,450
What kind of technology
can you use to visualize

5537
04:23:18,450 --> 04:23:20,760
where you are to light your way?

5538
04:23:20,760 --> 04:23:24,450
- Yeah, so it's a cool
process on the software side.

5539
04:23:24,450 --> 04:23:26,310
You take a preoperative MRI

5540
04:23:26,309 --> 04:23:30,329
that's extremely high resolution
data of the entire brain.

5541
04:23:30,329 --> 04:23:33,329
You put the patient to sleep,

5542
04:23:33,329 --> 04:23:34,799
put their head in a frame

5543
04:23:34,799 --> 04:23:37,379
that holds the skull very rigidly,

5544
04:23:37,379 --> 04:23:40,649
and then you take a CT scan of their head

5545
04:23:40,649 --> 04:23:43,020
while they're asleep with that frame on,

5546
04:23:43,020 --> 04:23:47,700
and then merge the MRI
and the CT in software.

5547
04:23:47,700 --> 04:23:50,610
You have a plan based on the MRI

5548
04:23:50,610 --> 04:23:53,550
where you can see these
nuclei deep in the brain.

5549
04:23:53,549 --> 04:23:55,079
You can't see them on CT,

5550
04:23:55,079 --> 04:23:59,850
but if you trust the
merging of the two images,

5551
04:23:59,850 --> 04:24:03,090
then you indirectly know
on the CT where that is.

5552
04:24:03,090 --> 04:24:05,760
And therefore, indirectly know

5553
04:24:05,760 --> 04:24:08,760
where in reference to the titanium frame

5554
04:24:08,760 --> 04:24:11,670
screwed to their head those targets are.

5555
04:24:11,670 --> 04:24:16,079
And so this is '60s
technology to manually compute

5556
04:24:16,079 --> 04:24:18,819
trajectories, given the
entry point and target

5557
04:24:20,309 --> 04:24:25,052
and dial in some goofy
looking titanium actuators

5558
04:24:27,569 --> 04:24:31,802
with a manual actuators with
little tick marks on them.

5559
04:24:32,940 --> 04:24:35,190
The modern version of
that is to use a robot.

5560
04:24:36,329 --> 04:24:39,420
Just like a little KUKA arm,

5561
04:24:39,420 --> 04:24:42,569
you might see it building
cars at the Tesla factory.

5562
04:24:42,569 --> 04:24:45,899
This small robot arm can
show you the trajectory

5563
04:24:45,899 --> 04:24:49,199
that you intended from the pre-op MRI

5564
04:24:49,200 --> 04:24:52,470
and establish a very rigid holder

5565
04:24:52,469 --> 04:24:55,500
through which you can drill
a small hole in the skull

5566
04:24:55,500 --> 04:24:59,190
and pass a small rigid wire
deep into that area of the brain

5567
04:24:59,190 --> 04:25:01,950
that's hollow and put your electrode

5568
04:25:01,950 --> 04:25:03,360
through that hollow wire

5569
04:25:03,360 --> 04:25:06,180
and then remove all of
that except the electrode.

5570
04:25:06,180 --> 04:25:07,950
So you end up with the electrode

5571
04:25:07,950 --> 04:25:12,600
very, very precisely placed
far from the skull surface.

5572
04:25:12,600 --> 04:25:17,600
Now that's standard
technology that's already,

5573
04:25:17,940 --> 04:25:20,222
been out in the world for a while.

5574
04:25:21,360 --> 04:25:25,680
Neuralink right now is focused
entirely on cortical targets,

5575
04:25:25,680 --> 04:25:30,680
surface targets because
there's no trivial way to get,

5576
04:25:31,260 --> 04:25:34,530
say, hundreds of wires
deep inside the brain

5577
04:25:34,530 --> 04:25:36,780
without doing a lot of damage.

5578
04:25:36,780 --> 04:25:39,690
So your question, what do you see?

5579
04:25:39,690 --> 04:25:41,610
Well, I see an MRI on a screen.

5580
04:25:41,610 --> 04:25:44,610
I can't see everything
that that DBS electrode

5581
04:25:44,610 --> 04:25:48,030
is passing through on its
way to that deep target.

5582
04:25:48,030 --> 04:25:51,300
And so it's accepted with this approach

5583
04:25:51,299 --> 04:25:54,359
that there's gonna be about
what one in a hundred patients

5584
04:25:54,360 --> 04:25:57,909
who have a bleed somewhere in the brain

5585
04:25:59,610 --> 04:26:01,860
as a result of passing that wire blindly

5586
04:26:01,860 --> 04:26:03,693
into the deep part of the brain.

5587
04:26:05,370 --> 04:26:09,300
That's not an acceptable
safety profile for Neuralink.

5588
04:26:09,299 --> 04:26:12,420
We start from the position

5589
04:26:12,420 --> 04:26:14,940
that we want this to be dramatically

5590
04:26:14,940 --> 04:26:18,302
maybe two or three orders of
magnitude safer than that.

5591
04:26:19,649 --> 04:26:22,469
Safe enough really that you or I,

5592
04:26:22,469 --> 04:26:24,542
without a profound medical problem,

5593
04:26:25,409 --> 04:26:27,217
might on our lunch break someday say,

5594
04:26:27,217 --> 04:26:28,527
"Yeah, sure, I'll get that.

5595
04:26:28,527 --> 04:26:31,770
I'd be meaning to upgrade
to the latest version."

5596
04:26:31,770 --> 04:26:36,513
And so the safety constraints
given that are high.

5597
04:26:38,459 --> 04:26:42,329
And so we haven't settled
on a final solution

5598
04:26:42,329 --> 04:26:46,319
for arbitrarily approaching
deep targets in the brain.

5599
04:26:46,319 --> 04:26:47,879
- It's interesting 'cause
like you have to avoid

5600
04:26:47,879 --> 04:26:49,143
blood vessels somehow.

5601
04:26:50,520 --> 04:26:52,380
Maybe there's creative ways
of doing the same thing,

5602
04:26:52,379 --> 04:26:55,709
like mapping out high resolution
geometry of blood vessels

5603
04:26:55,709 --> 04:26:57,362
and then you can go in blind.

5604
04:26:58,829 --> 04:27:00,959
But how do you map out that

5605
04:27:00,959 --> 04:27:03,389
in a way that's like super stable?

5606
04:27:03,389 --> 04:27:04,979
There's a lot of interesting
challenges there, right?

5607
04:27:04,979 --> 04:27:06,090
- [Matthew] Yeah.

5608
04:27:06,090 --> 04:27:07,649
- But there's a lot to do on the surface.

5609
04:27:07,649 --> 04:27:08,609
Luckily.
- Exactly.

5610
04:27:08,610 --> 04:27:10,773
So we've got vision on the surface.

5611
04:27:12,389 --> 04:27:14,729
We actually have made a
huge amount of progress

5612
04:27:14,729 --> 04:27:18,609
sewing electrodes into the spinal cord

5613
04:27:19,971 --> 04:27:23,639
as a potential workaround
for a spinal cord injury

5614
04:27:23,639 --> 04:27:25,889
that would allow a brain-mounted implant

5615
04:27:25,889 --> 04:27:29,879
to translate motor intentions
to a spine-mounted implant

5616
04:27:29,879 --> 04:27:33,449
that can effect muscle contractions

5617
04:27:33,450 --> 04:27:35,431
in previously paralyzed arms and legs.

5618
04:27:35,431 --> 04:27:36,264
- That's mind-blowing.

5619
04:27:36,263 --> 04:27:37,259
That's just incredible.

5620
04:27:37,260 --> 04:27:39,989
So like the effort there
is to try to bridge

5621
04:27:39,989 --> 04:27:42,449
the brain to the spinal cord

5622
04:27:42,450 --> 04:27:44,880
to the peripheral nervous system.

5623
04:27:44,879 --> 04:27:47,729
So how hard is that to do?

5624
04:27:47,729 --> 04:27:52,729
- We have that working in
very crude forms in animals.

5625
04:27:52,829 --> 04:27:54,229
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, we've done-

5626
04:27:54,229 --> 04:27:56,069
- So similar to like with Noland,

5627
04:27:56,069 --> 04:27:59,729
where he's able to
digitally move the cursor,

5628
04:27:59,729 --> 04:28:03,809
here you're doing the
same kind of communication

5629
04:28:03,809 --> 04:28:06,569
but with the actual factors that you have.

5630
04:28:06,569 --> 04:28:07,590
- Yeah.

5631
04:28:07,590 --> 04:28:08,469
- [Lex] That's fascinating.

5632
04:28:08,469 --> 04:28:13,469
- Yeah, so we have anesthetized
animals doing grasp

5633
04:28:13,860 --> 04:28:18,569
and moving their legs in
a sort of walking pattern.

5634
04:28:18,569 --> 04:28:20,610
Again, early days,

5635
04:28:20,610 --> 04:28:23,760
but the future is bright
for this kind of thing.

5636
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:26,520
And people with paralysis

5637
04:28:26,520 --> 04:28:28,979
should look forward to that bright future.

5638
04:28:28,979 --> 04:28:29,813
They're gonna have options.

5639
04:28:29,813 --> 04:28:33,960
- Yeah, and there's a lot
of sort of intermediate

5640
04:28:33,959 --> 04:28:37,379
or extra options where you
take like an Optimus robot,

5641
04:28:37,379 --> 04:28:42,379
like the arm, and to be
able to control the arm.

5642
04:28:42,719 --> 04:28:47,579
The fingers and hands of
the arm as a prosthetic.

5643
04:28:47,579 --> 04:28:49,469
- So skeletons are getting better too.

5644
04:28:49,469 --> 04:28:50,432
- So skeletons.

5645
04:28:51,989 --> 04:28:54,510
Yeah, so that goes hand in hand.

5646
04:28:54,510 --> 04:28:56,159
Although I didn't quite understand

5647
04:28:56,159 --> 04:28:57,096
until thinking about it deeply

5648
04:28:57,096 --> 04:29:00,329
and doing more research about Neuralink,

5649
04:29:00,329 --> 04:29:02,879
how much you can do on the digital side.

5650
04:29:02,879 --> 04:29:05,279
So this digital telepathy,

5651
04:29:05,280 --> 04:29:07,170
I didn't quite understand

5652
04:29:07,170 --> 04:29:10,532
that you can really map the intention,

5653
04:29:11,670 --> 04:29:15,450
as you described in the hand knob area,

5654
04:29:15,450 --> 04:29:17,760
that you can map the intention.

5655
04:29:17,760 --> 04:29:20,520
Just imagine it, think about it.

5656
04:29:20,520 --> 04:29:22,079
That intention can be mapped

5657
04:29:22,079 --> 04:29:24,510
to actual action in the digital world.

5658
04:29:24,510 --> 04:29:26,520
And now more and more, so much can be done

5659
04:29:26,520 --> 04:29:30,954
in the digital world
that it can reconnect you

5660
04:29:30,954 --> 04:29:32,370
to the outside world.

5661
04:29:32,370 --> 04:29:34,829
It can allow you to have freedom,

5662
04:29:34,829 --> 04:29:37,889
have independence if
you're a quadriplegic.

5663
04:29:37,889 --> 04:29:38,879
That's really powerful.

5664
04:29:38,879 --> 04:29:40,709
Like you can go really far with that.

5665
04:29:40,709 --> 04:29:44,639
- Yeah, our first
participant, he's incredible.

5666
04:29:44,639 --> 04:29:46,739
He's breaking world
records left and right.

5667
04:29:46,739 --> 04:29:48,889
- And he is having fun
with it, it's great.

5668
04:29:49,979 --> 04:29:54,722
Just going back to the
surgery, your whole journey,

5669
04:29:55,559 --> 04:29:58,289
you mentioned to me offline,
you have surgery on Monday.

5670
04:29:58,290 --> 04:30:00,900
So you're like doing surgery all the time.

5671
04:30:00,899 --> 04:30:01,733
- Yeah.

5672
04:30:01,733 --> 04:30:02,610
- Maybe the ridiculous question,

5673
04:30:02,610 --> 04:30:04,920
what does it take to get good at surgery?

5674
04:30:04,920 --> 04:30:07,139
- Practice, repetitions.

5675
04:30:07,139 --> 04:30:08,462
Same with anything else.

5676
04:30:09,299 --> 04:30:12,059
There's a million ways of
people saying the same thing

5677
04:30:12,059 --> 04:30:13,350
and selling books saying it,

5678
04:30:13,350 --> 04:30:16,559
but you call it 10,000
hours, you call it, you know,

5679
04:30:16,559 --> 04:30:18,119
spend some chunk of your life,

5680
04:30:18,120 --> 04:30:21,210
some percentage of your
life focusing on this,

5681
04:30:21,209 --> 04:30:23,162
obsessing about getting better at it.

5682
04:30:25,110 --> 04:30:30,110
Repetitions, humility, recognizing
that you aren't perfect

5683
04:30:31,229 --> 04:30:33,629
at any stage along the way.

5684
04:30:33,629 --> 04:30:35,939
Recognizing you've got improvements

5685
04:30:35,940 --> 04:30:37,829
to make in your technique.

5686
04:30:37,829 --> 04:30:39,809
Being open to feedback and coaching

5687
04:30:39,809 --> 04:30:42,813
from people with a different
perspective on how to do it.

5688
04:30:44,819 --> 04:30:49,819
And then just the constant
will to do better.

5689
04:30:51,299 --> 04:30:53,670
That fortunately, if
you're not a sociopath,

5690
04:30:53,670 --> 04:30:56,059
I think your patients bring that with them

5691
04:30:56,059 --> 04:30:58,439
to the office visits every day.

5692
04:30:58,440 --> 04:31:01,800
They force you to wanna
do better all the time.

5693
04:31:01,799 --> 04:31:03,338
- Yeah, to step up.

5694
04:31:03,338 --> 04:31:05,219
I mean, it's a real human being,

5695
04:31:05,219 --> 04:31:07,260
a real human being that you can help.

5696
04:31:07,260 --> 04:31:09,180
- Yeah.
- So every surgery,

5697
04:31:09,180 --> 04:31:11,729
even if it's the same exact surgery,

5698
04:31:11,729 --> 04:31:12,869
is there a lot of variability

5699
04:31:12,870 --> 04:31:15,270
between that surgery
and a different person?

5700
04:31:15,270 --> 04:31:16,290
- Yeah, a fair bit.

5701
04:31:16,290 --> 04:31:21,290
I mean, a good example for
us is the angle of the skull

5702
04:31:22,020 --> 04:31:26,760
relative to the normal
plane of the body axis,

5703
04:31:26,760 --> 04:31:31,739
of the skull over hand knob
is pretty wide variation.

5704
04:31:31,739 --> 04:31:34,949
I mean, some people
have really flat skulls,

5705
04:31:34,950 --> 04:31:36,780
and some people have really steeply

5706
04:31:36,780 --> 04:31:38,067
angled skulls over that area.

5707
04:31:38,066 --> 04:31:43,066
And that has consequences for
how their head can be fixed

5708
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:47,649
in sort of the frame that we use

5709
04:31:48,540 --> 04:31:51,063
and how the robot has
to approach the skull.

5710
04:31:53,700 --> 04:31:56,220
Yeah, people's bodies
are built as differently

5711
04:31:56,219 --> 04:31:59,381
as the people you see
walking down the street,

5712
04:31:59,381 --> 04:32:03,510
as much variability in body
shape and size as you see there.

5713
04:32:03,510 --> 04:32:06,423
We see in brain anatomy and skull anatomy,

5714
04:32:07,829 --> 04:32:11,309
there are some people who
we've had to kind of exclude

5715
04:32:11,309 --> 04:32:13,739
from our trial for having skulls

5716
04:32:13,739 --> 04:32:15,209
that are too thick or too thin

5717
04:32:15,209 --> 04:32:17,643
or scalp that's too thick or too thin.

5718
04:32:19,170 --> 04:32:23,447
I think we have like the
middle 97% or so of people,

5719
04:32:24,450 --> 04:32:29,450
but you can't account for all
human anatomy variability.

5720
04:32:29,700 --> 04:32:33,810
- How much like mushiness
and messes there,

5721
04:32:33,809 --> 04:32:36,510
'cause taking biology classes,

5722
04:32:36,510 --> 04:32:39,329
the diagrams are always
really clean and crisp.

5723
04:32:39,329 --> 04:32:41,729
Neuroscience, the pictures of neurons

5724
04:32:41,729 --> 04:32:43,772
are always really nice and vary.

5725
04:32:45,389 --> 04:32:49,112
But whenever I look at
pictures of like real brains,

5726
04:32:50,069 --> 04:32:51,959
I don't know what is going on.

5727
04:32:51,959 --> 04:32:53,189
- Yeah.
- So how much

5728
04:32:53,190 --> 04:32:55,860
are biological systems in reality?

5729
04:32:55,860 --> 04:32:59,010
Like how hard is it to
figure out what's going on?

5730
04:32:59,010 --> 04:33:00,149
- Not too bad.

5731
04:33:00,149 --> 04:33:02,313
Once you really get used to this,

5732
04:33:03,479 --> 04:33:08,099
that's where experience
and skill and education

5733
04:33:08,099 --> 04:33:12,272
really come into play is if
you stare at a thousand brains,

5734
04:33:13,590 --> 04:33:17,310
it becomes easier to kind
of mentally peel back

5735
04:33:17,310 --> 04:33:19,620
the, say, for instance, blood vessels

5736
04:33:19,619 --> 04:33:23,369
that are obscuring the sulci and gyri,

5737
04:33:23,369 --> 04:33:26,399
kind of the wrinkle pattern
of the surface of the brain.

5738
04:33:26,400 --> 04:33:28,527
Occasionally, when you're
first starting to do this

5739
04:33:28,526 --> 04:33:32,459
and you open the skull, it doesn't match

5740
04:33:32,459 --> 04:33:35,110
what you thought you were
gonna see based on the MRI.

5741
04:33:37,319 --> 04:33:42,319
And with more experience, you
learn to kind of peel back

5742
04:33:42,750 --> 04:33:44,790
that layer of blood vessels

5743
04:33:44,790 --> 04:33:48,000
and see the underlying pattern
of wrinkles in the brain

5744
04:33:48,000 --> 04:33:51,659
and use that as a landmark
for where you are.

5745
04:33:51,659 --> 04:33:53,279
- [Lex] The wrinkles are a landmark?

5746
04:33:53,279 --> 04:33:54,209
So like-
- Yeah.

5747
04:33:54,209 --> 04:33:56,430
So I was describing hand knob earlier.

5748
04:33:56,430 --> 04:33:58,619
That's a pattern of the
wrinkles in the brain.

5749
04:33:58,619 --> 04:34:00,899
It's sort of this sort of Greek letter,

5750
04:34:00,900 --> 04:34:04,230
omega-shaped area of the brain.

5751
04:34:04,229 --> 04:34:06,090
- So you could recognize
the hand knob area.

5752
04:34:06,090 --> 04:34:09,479
Like if I show you a thousand brains

5753
04:34:09,479 --> 04:34:11,159
and give you like one minute with each,

5754
04:34:11,159 --> 04:34:12,686
you'd be like, "Yep, that's that?"

5755
04:34:12,687 --> 04:34:14,430
- Sure.
- And so there is some

5756
04:34:14,430 --> 04:34:16,799
uniqueness to that area of the brain,

5757
04:34:16,799 --> 04:34:19,829
like in terms of the geometry,
the topology of the thing.

5758
04:34:19,830 --> 04:34:20,663
- Yeah.

5759
04:34:21,659 --> 04:34:23,492
- Where is it about in the-

5760
04:34:24,840 --> 04:34:27,720
- So you have this strip of
brain running down the top

5761
04:34:27,720 --> 04:34:29,460
called the primary motor area.

5762
04:34:29,459 --> 04:34:33,059
And I'm sure you've seen this
picture of the homunculus

5763
04:34:33,060 --> 04:34:34,470
laid over the surface of the brain,

5764
04:34:34,470 --> 04:34:38,433
the weird little guy with
huge lips and giant hands.

5765
04:34:40,110 --> 04:34:42,659
That guy sort of lays with his legs

5766
04:34:42,659 --> 04:34:47,659
up at the top of the brain and
face, arm, areas farther down

5767
04:34:47,790 --> 04:34:52,790
and then some kind of mouth,
lip, tongue areas farther down.

5768
04:34:54,389 --> 04:34:57,360
And so the hand is right in there.

5769
04:34:57,360 --> 04:34:59,819
And then the areas that control speech,

5770
04:34:59,819 --> 04:35:01,979
at least on the left side of the brain

5771
04:35:01,979 --> 04:35:05,069
in most people are just below that.

5772
04:35:05,069 --> 04:35:10,069
And so any muscle that you
voluntarily move in your body,

5773
04:35:11,250 --> 04:35:14,849
the vast majority of that
references that strip

5774
04:35:14,849 --> 04:35:17,756
or those intentions come
from that strip of brain.

5775
04:35:17,757 --> 04:35:20,640
And the wrinkle for hand knob

5776
04:35:20,639 --> 04:35:22,829
is right in the middle of that.

5777
04:35:22,830 --> 04:35:25,710
- And vision is back here.
- Back, yep.

5778
04:35:25,709 --> 04:35:27,750
- Also, close to the surface?

5779
04:35:27,750 --> 04:35:28,860
- Vision's a little deeper.

5780
04:35:28,860 --> 04:35:31,830
And so this gets to your question about

5781
04:35:31,830 --> 04:35:36,330
how deep can you get to do vision.

5782
04:35:36,330 --> 04:35:38,550
We can't just do the surface of the brain.

5783
04:35:38,549 --> 04:35:40,082
We have to be able to go in,

5784
04:35:40,966 --> 04:35:43,500
not as deep as we have to go for DBS,

5785
04:35:43,500 --> 04:35:45,810
but maybe a centimeter deeper

5786
04:35:45,810 --> 04:35:49,010
than we're used to for hand insertions.

5787
04:35:50,133 --> 04:35:52,620
And so that's work in progress.

5788
04:35:52,619 --> 04:35:55,619
That's a new set of
challenges to overcome.

5789
04:35:55,619 --> 04:35:58,020
- By the way, you
mentioned the Utah array.

5790
04:35:58,020 --> 04:36:00,386
And I just saw a picture of that,

5791
04:36:00,386 --> 04:36:02,430
and that thing looks terrifying.

5792
04:36:02,430 --> 04:36:04,709
- [Matthew] Yeah, bed of nails.

5793
04:36:04,709 --> 04:36:05,969
- It's because it's rigid.

5794
04:36:05,970 --> 04:36:09,600
And then if you look at the
threads, they're flexible.

5795
04:36:09,599 --> 04:36:11,039
What can you say that's interesting to you

5796
04:36:11,040 --> 04:36:13,560
about the flexible, that kind of approach

5797
04:36:13,560 --> 04:36:15,420
of the flexible threads

5798
04:36:15,419 --> 04:36:18,179
to deliver the electrodes
next to the neurons?

5799
04:36:18,180 --> 04:36:21,959
- Yeah, I mean, the goal
there comes from experience.

5800
04:36:21,959 --> 04:36:23,790
I mean, we stand on
the shoulders of people

5801
04:36:23,790 --> 04:36:28,200
that made Utah arrays and
used Utah arrays for decades

5802
04:36:28,200 --> 04:36:29,913
before we ever even came along.

5803
04:36:32,310 --> 04:36:34,800
Neuralink arose, partly this approach

5804
04:36:34,799 --> 04:36:38,079
to technology arose out
of a need recognized

5805
04:36:39,060 --> 04:36:42,040
after Utah arrays would fail routinely

5806
04:36:43,110 --> 04:36:44,880
because the rigid electrodes,

5807
04:36:44,880 --> 04:36:48,960
those spikes that are literally hammered

5808
04:36:48,959 --> 04:36:51,393
using an air hammer into the brain,

5809
04:36:53,880 --> 04:36:56,700
those spikes generate
a bad immune response

5810
04:36:56,700 --> 04:37:00,810
that encapsulates the electrode spikes

5811
04:37:00,810 --> 04:37:04,260
in scar tissue essentially.

5812
04:37:04,259 --> 04:37:06,809
And so one of the projects
that was being worked on

5813
04:37:06,810 --> 04:37:11,190
in the Andersen lab at
Caltech when I got there,

5814
04:37:11,189 --> 04:37:13,239
was to see if you could use chemotherapy

5815
04:37:14,549 --> 04:37:16,532
to prevent the formation of scar.

5816
04:37:17,880 --> 04:37:20,370
Things are pretty bad when
you're jamming a bed of nails

5817
04:37:20,369 --> 04:37:25,369
into the brain and then
treating that with chemotherapy

5818
04:37:26,279 --> 04:37:27,569
to try to prevent scar tissue.

5819
04:37:27,569 --> 04:37:29,970
It's like, maybe we've
gotten off track here, guys.

5820
04:37:29,970 --> 04:37:32,819
Maybe there's a fundamental
redesign necessary.

5821
04:37:32,819 --> 04:37:36,360
And so Neuralink's approach
of using highly flexible,

5822
04:37:36,360 --> 04:37:41,360
tiny electrodes avoids
a lot of the bleeding,

5823
04:37:41,759 --> 04:37:45,209
avoids a lot of the immune
response that ends up happening

5824
04:37:45,209 --> 04:37:48,000
when rigid electrodes are
pounded into the brain.

5825
04:37:48,000 --> 04:37:51,509
And so what we see is
our electrode longevity

5826
04:37:51,509 --> 04:37:55,289
and functionality and the
health of the brain tissue

5827
04:37:55,290 --> 04:37:59,190
immediately surrounding
the electrode is excellent.

5828
04:37:59,189 --> 04:38:03,539
I mean, it goes on for years
now in our animal models.

5829
04:38:03,540 --> 04:38:05,190
- What do most people not understand

5830
04:38:05,189 --> 04:38:07,619
about the biology of the brain?

5831
04:38:07,619 --> 04:38:08,969
We mention the vasculature.

5832
04:38:08,970 --> 04:38:10,200
That's really interesting.

5833
04:38:10,200 --> 04:38:14,319
- I think the most interesting
maybe underappreciated fact

5834
04:38:16,560 --> 04:38:18,870
is that it really does
control almost everything.

5835
04:38:18,869 --> 04:38:23,279
I mean, I don't know, for
out of the blue example,

5836
04:38:23,279 --> 04:38:26,002
imagine you want a lever on fertility,

5837
04:38:26,002 --> 04:38:28,590
you wanna be able to turn
fertility on and off.

5838
04:38:28,590 --> 04:38:32,849
I mean, there are legitimate
targets in the brain itself

5839
04:38:32,849 --> 04:38:37,849
to modulate fertility, say blood pressure.

5840
04:38:38,250 --> 04:38:40,740
You wanna modulate blood pressure.

5841
04:38:40,740 --> 04:38:43,590
There are legitimate targets
in the brain for doing that.

5842
04:38:45,029 --> 04:38:49,439
Things that aren't immediately
obvious as brain problems

5843
04:38:49,439 --> 04:38:51,812
are potentially solvable in the brain.

5844
04:38:53,824 --> 04:38:57,190
And so I think it's an under-explored

5845
04:38:58,650 --> 04:39:01,450
area for primary treatments

5846
04:39:02,435 --> 04:39:04,440
of all the things that bother people.

5847
04:39:04,439 --> 04:39:06,479
- That's a really fascinating
way to look at it.

5848
04:39:06,479 --> 04:39:10,619
Like there's a lot of
conditions we might think

5849
04:39:10,619 --> 04:39:12,389
have nothing to do with the brain,

5850
04:39:12,389 --> 04:39:13,919
but they might just be symptoms

5851
04:39:13,919 --> 04:39:15,869
of something that actually
started in the brain.

5852
04:39:15,869 --> 04:39:17,549
The actual source of the problem.

5853
04:39:17,549 --> 04:39:19,719
The primary source is
something in the brain.

5854
04:39:19,720 --> 04:39:20,909
- Yeah, not always.

5855
04:39:20,909 --> 04:39:23,340
I mean, kidney disease is real.

5856
04:39:23,340 --> 04:39:27,119
But there are levers you
can pull in the brain

5857
04:39:27,119 --> 04:39:29,579
that affect all of these systems.

5858
04:39:29,580 --> 04:39:31,173
- There's knobs.
- Yeah.

5859
04:39:32,520 --> 04:39:35,430
- On-off switches and knobs in the brain,

5860
04:39:35,430 --> 04:39:37,863
from which this all originates.

5861
04:39:39,389 --> 04:39:42,779
Would you have a Neuralink
chip implanted in your brain?

5862
04:39:42,779 --> 04:39:43,612
- Yeah.

5863
04:39:45,599 --> 04:39:50,599
I think use case right
now is use a mouse, right?

5864
04:39:51,840 --> 04:39:52,917
I can already do that.

5865
04:39:52,917 --> 04:39:56,400
And so there's no value proposition.

5866
04:39:56,400 --> 04:39:58,290
On safety grounds alone, sure.

5867
04:39:58,290 --> 04:39:59,580
I'll do it tomorrow.

5868
04:39:59,580 --> 04:40:01,683
- You say the use case of the mouse,

5869
04:40:03,689 --> 04:40:04,947
is it after like researching all this

5870
04:40:04,947 --> 04:40:07,746
and part of it is just watching
Noland have so much fun?

5871
04:40:08,610 --> 04:40:10,350
If you can get that bits per second

5872
04:40:10,349 --> 04:40:12,719
look really high with a mouse,

5873
04:40:12,720 --> 04:40:14,447
like being able to interact,

5874
04:40:14,447 --> 04:40:17,296
'cause if you think about it, the way,

5875
04:40:17,296 --> 04:40:19,020
on the smartphone, the way you swipe,

5876
04:40:19,020 --> 04:40:22,380
that was transformational how
you interact with a thing.

5877
04:40:22,380 --> 04:40:23,549
It's subtle.

5878
04:40:23,549 --> 04:40:26,159
You don't realize it, but
to able to touch a phone

5879
04:40:26,159 --> 04:40:29,849
and to scroll with your
finger, that's like,

5880
04:40:29,849 --> 04:40:31,199
that changed everything.

5881
04:40:31,200 --> 04:40:33,450
People were sure you
need a keyboard to type.

5882
04:40:36,840 --> 04:40:39,060
There's a lot of HCI aspects to that

5883
04:40:39,060 --> 04:40:41,909
that changed how we
interact with computers.

5884
04:40:41,909 --> 04:40:46,169
So there could be a certain
rate of speed with the mouse

5885
04:40:46,169 --> 04:40:48,000
that would change everything.

5886
04:40:48,000 --> 04:40:49,110
- Yeah.
- It's like you might be able

5887
04:40:49,110 --> 04:40:52,200
to just click around a
screen extremely fast.

5888
04:40:52,200 --> 04:40:53,032
And that,

5889
04:40:56,580 --> 04:40:58,560
I can see myself getting a Neuralink

5890
04:40:58,560 --> 04:41:02,970
for much more rapid interaction
with the digital devices.

5891
04:41:02,970 --> 04:41:07,138
- Yeah, I think recording
speech intentions from the brain

5892
04:41:07,137 --> 04:41:09,180
might change things as well.

5893
04:41:09,180 --> 04:41:11,430
The value proposition
for the average person,

5894
04:41:12,869 --> 04:41:16,319
a keyboard is a pretty
clunky human interface,

5895
04:41:16,319 --> 04:41:18,329
requires a lot of training.

5896
04:41:18,330 --> 04:41:22,170
It's highly variable in
the maximum performance

5897
04:41:22,169 --> 04:41:25,982
that the average person can achieve.

5898
04:41:27,270 --> 04:41:31,049
I think taking that out of the equation

5899
04:41:31,049 --> 04:41:32,619
and just having a natural

5900
04:41:34,080 --> 04:41:36,460
word to computer interface

5901
04:41:38,700 --> 04:41:40,500
might change things for a lot of people.

5902
04:41:40,500 --> 04:41:43,229
- It'd be hilarious if that
is the reason people do it.

5903
04:41:43,229 --> 04:41:44,790
Even if you have speech to text,

5904
04:41:44,790 --> 04:41:47,340
that's extremely accurate,
it currently isn't,

5905
04:41:47,340 --> 04:41:49,709
but say it gotten super accurate,

5906
04:41:49,709 --> 04:41:52,110
it'd be hilarious if
people went for Neuralink

5907
04:41:52,110 --> 04:41:55,560
just so you avoid the
embarrassing aspect of speaking,

5908
04:41:55,560 --> 04:41:57,060
like looking like a douche bag speaking

5909
04:41:57,060 --> 04:41:59,370
to your phone in public, which is a real,

5910
04:41:59,369 --> 04:42:02,489
like that's a real constraint.

5911
04:42:02,490 --> 04:42:03,323
- Yeah.

5912
04:42:03,323 --> 04:42:07,439
I mean, with a bone conducting case,

5913
04:42:07,439 --> 04:42:10,652
that can be an invisible headphone, say,

5914
04:42:11,790 --> 04:42:16,790
and the ability to think
words into software

5915
04:42:16,919 --> 04:42:18,393
and have it respond to you,

5916
04:42:21,122 --> 04:42:22,829
that starts to sound sort of like

5917
04:42:22,830 --> 04:42:24,780
embedded super intelligence.

5918
04:42:24,779 --> 04:42:29,549
If you can silently ask
for the Wikipedia article

5919
04:42:29,549 --> 04:42:32,279
on any subject and have it read to you,

5920
04:42:32,279 --> 04:42:34,139
without any observable change

5921
04:42:34,139 --> 04:42:35,689
happening in the outside world,

5922
04:42:38,849 --> 04:42:43,169
for one thing, standardized
testing is obsolete. (laughs)

5923
04:42:43,169 --> 04:42:44,002
- Yeah.

5924
04:42:44,003 --> 04:42:47,190
If it's done well in the
UX side, it could change.

5925
04:42:47,189 --> 04:42:48,779
I don't know if it transforms society,

5926
04:42:48,779 --> 04:42:53,340
but it really can create a kind of shift

5927
04:42:53,340 --> 04:42:55,740
in the way we interact
with digital devices

5928
04:42:55,740 --> 04:42:57,390
in the way that a smartphone did.

5929
04:42:59,700 --> 04:43:02,520
Just having to look into the
safety of everything involved,

5930
04:43:02,520 --> 04:43:04,830
I would totally try it
so it doesn't have to go

5931
04:43:04,830 --> 04:43:09,240
to some like incredible
thing where you have,

5932
04:43:09,240 --> 04:43:11,130
it connects your vision or to some other,

5933
04:43:11,130 --> 04:43:12,630
like it connects all over your brain.

5934
04:43:12,630 --> 04:43:15,363
That could be like just
connecting to the hand knob.

5935
04:43:16,680 --> 04:43:18,750
You might have a lot of
interesting interaction,

5936
04:43:18,750 --> 04:43:21,569
human-computer interaction possibilities.

5937
04:43:21,569 --> 04:43:22,402
That's really interesting.

5938
04:43:22,402 --> 04:43:25,529
- Yeah, and the technology
on the academic side

5939
04:43:25,529 --> 04:43:27,149
is progressing at light speed here.

5940
04:43:27,150 --> 04:43:32,150
I think there was a really
amazing paper out of UC Davis,

5941
04:43:32,250 --> 04:43:37,110
Sergey Stavisky's lab that
basically made a initial solve

5942
04:43:37,110 --> 04:43:39,840
of speech decode.

5943
04:43:39,840 --> 04:43:43,020
It was something like 125,000 words

5944
04:43:43,020 --> 04:43:46,950
that they we're getting with
very high accuracy, which is-

5945
04:43:46,950 --> 04:43:48,630
- So you're just thinking the word?

5946
04:43:48,630 --> 04:43:49,950
- Yeah.
- Thinking the word

5947
04:43:49,950 --> 04:43:51,150
and you're able to get it?

5948
04:43:51,150 --> 04:43:52,653
- Yeah.
- Oh boy.

5949
04:43:54,119 --> 04:43:56,369
Like you have to have the
intention of speaking it.

5950
04:43:56,369 --> 04:43:57,202
- Right.

5951
04:43:57,203 --> 04:43:59,310
- So like do the inner voice.

5952
04:43:59,310 --> 04:44:03,600
Man, it's so amazing to me
that you can do the intention,

5953
04:44:03,599 --> 04:44:05,729
the signal mapping.

5954
04:44:05,729 --> 04:44:08,380
All you have to do is just
imagine yourself doing it.

5955
04:44:11,141 --> 04:44:14,459
And if you get the feedback
that it actually worked,

5956
04:44:14,459 --> 04:44:16,680
you can get really good at that.

5957
04:44:16,680 --> 04:44:18,023
Like your brain will first of all adjust

5958
04:44:18,023 --> 04:44:20,490
and you develop it like any other skill.

5959
04:44:20,490 --> 04:44:23,290
Like touch typing, you develop
in that same kind of way.

5960
04:44:24,779 --> 04:44:27,360
To me, it's just really fascinating

5961
04:44:27,360 --> 04:44:29,369
to be able to even to play with that.

5962
04:44:29,369 --> 04:44:30,809
Honestly, like I would get a Neuralink

5963
04:44:30,810 --> 04:44:32,640
just to be able to play with that.

5964
04:44:32,639 --> 04:44:34,649
Just to play with the capacity,

5965
04:44:34,650 --> 04:44:37,650
the capability of my
mind to learn this skill.

5966
04:44:37,650 --> 04:44:39,300
It's like learning the skill of typing

5967
04:44:39,299 --> 04:44:41,040
and learning the skill of moving a mouse.

5968
04:44:41,040 --> 04:44:43,860
It's another skill of moving the mouse,

5969
04:44:43,860 --> 04:44:47,580
not with my physical
body, but with my mind.

5970
04:44:47,580 --> 04:44:49,200
- I can't wait to see
what people do with it.

5971
04:44:49,200 --> 04:44:51,630
I feel like we're cavemen right now.

5972
04:44:51,630 --> 04:44:53,819
We're like banging rocks with a stick

5973
04:44:53,819 --> 04:44:55,669
and thinking that we're making music.

5974
04:44:57,000 --> 04:44:59,159
At some point, when these
are more widespread,

5975
04:44:59,159 --> 04:45:02,639
there's gonna be the equivalent of a piano

5976
04:45:02,639 --> 04:45:06,630
that someone can make art with their brain

5977
04:45:06,630 --> 04:45:08,630
in a way that we didn't even anticipate.

5978
04:45:10,657 --> 04:45:12,239
I'm looking forward to it.

5979
04:45:12,240 --> 04:45:13,409
- Give it to like a teenager.

5980
04:45:13,409 --> 04:45:15,299
Like anytime I think
I'm good at something,

5981
04:45:15,299 --> 04:45:17,255
I'll always go to like, I don't know.

5982
04:45:17,255 --> 04:45:21,690
Even with the bit per second
of playing a video game,

5983
04:45:21,689 --> 04:45:23,009
you realize you give it to a teenager,

5984
04:45:23,009 --> 04:45:24,840
you've given your link to a teenager,

5985
04:45:24,840 --> 04:45:26,580
just the large number of them,

5986
04:45:26,580 --> 04:45:30,150
the kind of stuff, they get good at stuff.

5987
04:45:30,150 --> 04:45:34,953
They're gonna get like
hundreds of bits per second.

5988
04:45:35,798 --> 04:45:37,439
Even just with the current technology.

5989
04:45:37,439 --> 04:45:38,879
- Probably.

5990
04:45:38,880 --> 04:45:39,712
Probably.

5991
04:45:41,009 --> 04:45:42,459
- 'Cause it's also addicting,

5992
04:45:43,791 --> 04:45:46,520
the number go up aspect of it

5993
04:45:46,520 --> 04:45:48,147
of like improving and training,

5994
04:45:48,147 --> 04:45:50,490
'cause it is almost like a skill.

5995
04:45:50,490 --> 04:45:52,350
And plus, there's the
software on the other end

5996
04:45:52,349 --> 04:45:54,119
that adapts to you.

5997
04:45:54,119 --> 04:45:57,000
And especially if the
adapting procedure algorithm

5998
04:45:57,000 --> 04:45:58,110
becomes better and better and better,

5999
04:45:58,110 --> 04:45:59,520
you're like learning together.

6000
04:45:59,520 --> 04:46:01,650
- Yeah, we're scratching the
surface on that right now.

6001
04:46:01,650 --> 04:46:03,330
There's so much more to do.

6002
04:46:03,330 --> 04:46:06,090
- So on the complete other side of it,

6003
04:46:06,090 --> 04:46:10,200
you have an RFID chip implanted in you.

6004
04:46:10,200 --> 04:46:13,110
- Yeah.
- So I hear, nice.

6005
04:46:13,110 --> 04:46:14,100
- Little subtle thing.

6006
04:46:14,099 --> 04:46:16,539
- It's a passive device that you use

6007
04:46:17,400 --> 04:46:20,819
for unlocking like a
safe with top secrets,

6008
04:46:20,819 --> 04:46:22,259
or what do you use it for?

6009
04:46:22,259 --> 04:46:23,699
What's the story behind it?

6010
04:46:23,700 --> 04:46:25,610
- I'm not the first one.

6011
04:46:25,610 --> 04:46:28,229
There's this whole community
of weirdo biohackers

6012
04:46:28,229 --> 04:46:30,060
that have done this stuff,

6013
04:46:30,060 --> 04:46:32,920
and I think one of the
early use cases was storing

6014
04:46:33,930 --> 04:46:37,473
private crypto wallet keys and whatever.

6015
04:46:38,490 --> 04:46:42,273
I dabbled in that a bit
and had some fun with it.

6016
04:46:44,019 --> 04:46:46,170
- You have some bitcoin
implanted in your body somewhere.

6017
04:46:46,169 --> 04:46:47,189
You can't tell where, yeah.

6018
04:46:47,189 --> 04:46:49,158
- Yeah, actually, yeah.

6019
04:46:49,158 --> 04:46:50,069
(Lex laughing)

6020
04:46:50,069 --> 04:46:51,779
It was the modern day equivalent

6021
04:46:51,779 --> 04:46:53,860
of finding change in the sofa cushions

6022
04:46:54,720 --> 04:46:57,479
after I put some orphan crypto on there

6023
04:46:57,479 --> 04:46:58,529
that I thought was worthless

6024
04:46:58,529 --> 04:47:00,750
and forgot about it for a few years.

6025
04:47:00,750 --> 04:47:04,209
Went back and found that some
community of people loved it

6026
04:47:05,189 --> 04:47:06,959
and had propped up the value of it.

6027
04:47:06,959 --> 04:47:09,599
And so it had gone up 50 fold.

6028
04:47:09,599 --> 04:47:10,432
- Wow.
- So there was a lot

6029
04:47:10,433 --> 04:47:11,612
of change in those cushions.

6030
04:47:11,612 --> 04:47:13,620
(Lex laughing)

6031
04:47:13,619 --> 04:47:14,452
- That's hilarious.

6032
04:47:14,453 --> 04:47:17,262
- But the primary use case was mostly

6033
04:47:17,261 --> 04:47:20,129
as a tech demonstrator.

6034
04:47:20,130 --> 04:47:22,139
It has my business card on it.

6035
04:47:22,139 --> 04:47:26,790
You can scan that in by
touching it to your phone.

6036
04:47:26,790 --> 04:47:29,100
It opens the front door to my house,

6037
04:47:29,099 --> 04:47:30,046
whatever simple stuff.

6038
04:47:30,046 --> 04:47:31,259
- It's a cool step.

6039
04:47:31,259 --> 04:47:33,989
It's a cool leap to implant
something in your body.

6040
04:47:33,990 --> 04:47:37,980
I mean, perhaps, it's a
similar leap to a Neuralink

6041
04:47:37,979 --> 04:47:40,619
because for a lot of
people, that kind of notion

6042
04:47:40,619 --> 04:47:43,289
of putting something inside
your body, something electronic

6043
04:47:43,290 --> 04:47:45,510
inside a biological system is a big leap.

6044
04:47:45,509 --> 04:47:48,179
- Yeah, we have a kind
of a mysticism around

6045
04:47:48,180 --> 04:47:50,729
the barrier of our skin.

6046
04:47:50,729 --> 04:47:53,099
We're completely fine
with knee replacements,

6047
04:47:53,099 --> 04:47:57,422
hip replacements, dental implants.

6048
04:47:59,459 --> 04:48:04,459
But there's a mysticism still around

6049
04:48:04,950 --> 04:48:07,860
the inviable barrier that
the skull represents.

6050
04:48:07,860 --> 04:48:10,500
And I think that needs to be treated

6051
04:48:10,500 --> 04:48:13,950
like any other pragmatic barrier.

6052
04:48:13,950 --> 04:48:18,950
The question isn't, how incredible
is it to open the skull?

6053
04:48:19,110 --> 04:48:21,869
The question is, what
benefit can we provide?

6054
04:48:21,869 --> 04:48:23,489
- So from all the surgeries you done,

6055
04:48:23,490 --> 04:48:26,159
from everything you understand the brain,

6056
04:48:26,159 --> 04:48:28,860
how much does neuroplasticity
come into play?

6057
04:48:28,860 --> 04:48:30,959
How adaptable is the brain, for example,

6058
04:48:30,959 --> 04:48:33,750
just even in the case
of healing from surgery

6059
04:48:33,750 --> 04:48:36,569
or adapting to the post-surgery situation.

6060
04:48:36,569 --> 04:48:38,700
- The answer that is sad for me

6061
04:48:38,700 --> 04:48:42,840
and other people of my demographic is that

6062
04:48:42,840 --> 04:48:44,970
plasticity decreases with age.

6063
04:48:44,970 --> 04:48:47,220
Healing decreases with age.

6064
04:48:47,220 --> 04:48:52,220
I have too much gray hair
to be optimistic about that.

6065
04:48:52,740 --> 04:48:55,980
There are theoretical ways
to increase plasticity

6066
04:48:55,979 --> 04:48:58,739
using electrical stimulation.

6067
04:48:58,740 --> 04:49:02,280
Nothing that is totally proven out

6068
04:49:02,279 --> 04:49:06,029
as a robust enough mechanism
to offer widely to people.

6069
04:49:06,029 --> 04:49:10,709
But yeah, I think there's
cause for optimism

6070
04:49:10,709 --> 04:49:13,709
that we might find something
useful in terms of, say,

6071
04:49:13,709 --> 04:49:16,802
an implanted electrode
that improves learning.

6072
04:49:18,389 --> 04:49:21,270
Certainly, there's been
some really amazing work

6073
04:49:21,270 --> 04:49:25,500
recently from Nicholas
Schiff, Jonathan Baker,

6074
04:49:25,500 --> 04:49:29,040
and others who have a cohort of patients

6075
04:49:29,040 --> 04:49:31,049
with moderate traumatic brain injury

6076
04:49:31,049 --> 04:49:32,430
who have had electrodes placed

6077
04:49:32,430 --> 04:49:34,889
in the deep nucleus in the brain

6078
04:49:34,889 --> 04:49:36,329
called the centromedian nucleus

6079
04:49:36,330 --> 04:49:38,910
or just near central media nucleus.

6080
04:49:38,909 --> 04:49:42,119
And when they apply small
amounts of electricity

6081
04:49:42,119 --> 04:49:44,099
to that part of the brain,

6082
04:49:44,099 --> 04:49:46,379
it's almost like electronic caffeine.

6083
04:49:46,380 --> 04:49:50,790
They're able to improve
people's attention and focus.

6084
04:49:50,790 --> 04:49:54,659
They're able to improve how
well people can perform a task.

6085
04:49:54,659 --> 04:49:58,169
I think in one case, someone
who was unable to work

6086
04:49:58,169 --> 04:50:01,829
after the device was turned on,
they were able to get a job.

6087
04:50:01,830 --> 04:50:04,900
And that's sort of one of the holy grails

6088
04:50:05,970 --> 04:50:10,350
for me with Neuralink and
other technologies like this

6089
04:50:10,349 --> 04:50:13,562
is from a purely utilitarian standpoint,

6090
04:50:17,009 --> 04:50:19,500
can we make people able
to take care of themselves

6091
04:50:19,500 --> 04:50:21,630
and their families economically again?

6092
04:50:21,630 --> 04:50:24,569
Can we make it so someone
who's fully dependent

6093
04:50:24,569 --> 04:50:28,889
and even maybe requires a
lot of caregiver resources,

6094
04:50:28,889 --> 04:50:32,399
can we put them in a position
to be fully independent,

6095
04:50:32,400 --> 04:50:35,400
taking care of themselves,
giving back to their communities?

6096
04:50:36,389 --> 04:50:40,020
I think that's a very
compelling proposition,

6097
04:50:40,020 --> 04:50:41,850
and what motivates a lot of what I do

6098
04:50:41,849 --> 04:50:44,969
and what a lot of the people
at Neuralink are working for.

6099
04:50:44,970 --> 04:50:46,470
- It's just a cool possibility

6100
04:50:46,470 --> 04:50:49,712
that if you put a Neuralink in
there, that the brain adapts,

6101
04:50:49,712 --> 04:50:52,709
like the other part of
the brain adapts too.

6102
04:50:52,709 --> 04:50:54,299
- Yeah.
- And integrates it.

6103
04:50:54,299 --> 04:50:56,819
The capacity of the brain to
do that is really interesting.

6104
04:50:56,819 --> 04:51:00,840
Probably unknown to the degree
to which you can do that,

6105
04:51:00,840 --> 04:51:05,159
but you're now connecting
an external thing to it,

6106
04:51:05,159 --> 04:51:09,093
especially once it's doing stimulation,

6107
04:51:10,139 --> 04:51:15,139
like the biological brain
and the electronic brain

6108
04:51:16,619 --> 04:51:18,512
outside of it working together.

6109
04:51:18,512 --> 04:51:20,913
Like the possibilities there
are really interesting.

6110
04:51:20,913 --> 04:51:23,343
It's still unknown but interesting.

6111
04:51:24,509 --> 04:51:26,189
It feels like the brain is really good

6112
04:51:26,189 --> 04:51:28,169
at adapting to whatever.

6113
04:51:28,169 --> 04:51:29,309
- Yeah.
- But of course,

6114
04:51:29,310 --> 04:51:31,863
it is a system that by itself is already,

6115
04:51:34,200 --> 04:51:36,450
like everything serves a purpose

6116
04:51:36,450 --> 04:51:39,540
and so you don't wanna
mess with it too much.

6117
04:51:39,540 --> 04:51:43,409
- Yeah, it's like, eliminating a species

6118
04:51:43,409 --> 04:51:45,060
from an ecology.

6119
04:51:45,060 --> 04:51:47,340
You don't know what the
delicate interconnections

6120
04:51:47,340 --> 04:51:48,512
and dependencies are.

6121
04:51:49,979 --> 04:51:54,599
The brain is certainly a
delicate, complex beast.

6122
04:51:54,599 --> 04:51:59,599
And we don't know every
potential downstream consequence

6123
04:52:00,689 --> 04:52:04,259
of a single change that we make.

6124
04:52:04,259 --> 04:52:08,189
- Do you see yourself
doing, so you mentioned P1,

6125
04:52:08,189 --> 04:52:11,309
surgeries of P2, P3, P4, P5?

6126
04:52:11,310 --> 04:52:14,159
Just more and more and more humans.

6127
04:52:14,159 --> 04:52:17,639
- I think it's a certain
kind of brittleness

6128
04:52:17,639 --> 04:52:20,099
or a failure on the company's side

6129
04:52:20,099 --> 04:52:23,492
if we need me to do all the surgeries.

6130
04:52:25,409 --> 04:52:27,930
I think something that I would very much

6131
04:52:27,930 --> 04:52:32,760
like to work towards is a
process that is so simple

6132
04:52:32,759 --> 04:52:34,559
and so robust on the surgery side

6133
04:52:34,560 --> 04:52:36,723
that literally anyone could do it.

6134
04:52:38,159 --> 04:52:42,659
We wanna get away from
requiring intense expertise

6135
04:52:42,659 --> 04:52:47,099
or intense experience to
have this successfully done

6136
04:52:47,099 --> 04:52:51,779
and make it as simple and
translatable as possible.

6137
04:52:51,779 --> 04:52:54,299
I mean, I would love it if
every neurosurgeon on the planet

6138
04:52:54,299 --> 04:52:55,862
had no problem doing this.

6139
04:52:58,110 --> 04:53:00,600
I think we're probably far
from a regulatory environment

6140
04:53:00,599 --> 04:53:04,109
that would allow people
that aren't neurosurgeons

6141
04:53:04,110 --> 04:53:06,903
to do this, but not impossible.

6142
04:53:08,099 --> 04:53:10,500
- All right, I'll sign up for that.

6143
04:53:10,500 --> 04:53:13,233
Did you ever anthropomorphize
the robot R1?

6144
04:53:14,610 --> 04:53:17,340
Like do you give it a name?

6145
04:53:17,340 --> 04:53:18,630
Do you see it as like a friend,

6146
04:53:18,630 --> 04:53:19,633
as like working together with you?

6147
04:53:19,633 --> 04:53:21,659
- I mean, to a certain degree it's-

6148
04:53:21,659 --> 04:53:23,509
- Or anatomy who's gonna get the gap.

6149
04:53:25,742 --> 04:53:29,672
- To a certain degree, yeah,
it's complex relationship.

6150
04:53:31,200 --> 04:53:32,909
- All the good relationships are.

6151
04:53:32,909 --> 04:53:35,130
- It's funny when, in the
middle of the surgery,

6152
04:53:35,130 --> 04:53:37,200
there's a part of it where I stand

6153
04:53:37,200 --> 04:53:40,049
basically shoulder to
shoulder with the robot.

6154
04:53:40,049 --> 04:53:44,939
And so if you're in the room
reading the body language,

6155
04:53:44,939 --> 04:53:46,799
that's my brother in arms there.

6156
04:53:46,799 --> 04:53:49,952
We're working together
on the same problem.

6157
04:53:52,020 --> 04:53:53,733
Yeah, I'm not threatened by it.

6158
04:53:55,349 --> 04:53:58,680
- Keep telling yourself that. (laughs)

6159
04:53:58,680 --> 04:54:01,712
How have all the surgeries that
you've done over the years,

6160
04:54:03,556 --> 04:54:05,760
the people you've helped and the stakes,

6161
04:54:05,759 --> 04:54:07,409
the high stakes that you've mentioned,

6162
04:54:07,409 --> 04:54:10,863
how has that changed your
understanding of life and death?

6163
04:54:13,619 --> 04:54:14,452
- Yeah.

6164
04:54:19,470 --> 04:54:22,290
It gives you a very visceral sense,

6165
04:54:22,290 --> 04:54:23,490
and this makes sound trite,

6166
04:54:23,490 --> 04:54:25,170
but it gives you a very visceral sense

6167
04:54:25,169 --> 04:54:26,972
that death is inevitable.

6168
04:54:28,290 --> 04:54:33,290
On one hand, you are, as a neurosurgeon,

6169
04:54:33,299 --> 04:54:34,829
you're deeply involved in these

6170
04:54:34,830 --> 04:54:38,223
like just hard to fathom tragedies:

6171
04:54:40,470 --> 04:54:45,470
young parents dying, leaving
a four-year-old behind say.

6172
04:54:49,560 --> 04:54:51,273
And on the other hand,

6173
04:54:52,500 --> 04:54:54,700
it takes the sting out of it a bit because

6174
04:54:56,220 --> 04:55:00,870
you see how just mind
numbingly universal death is.

6175
04:55:00,869 --> 04:55:05,073
There's zero chance that
I'm going to avoid it.

6176
04:55:06,360 --> 04:55:10,770
I know techno optimists right now

6177
04:55:10,770 --> 04:55:12,750
and longevity buffs right now

6178
04:55:12,750 --> 04:55:17,750
would disagree on that 0.0% estimate.

6179
04:55:18,119 --> 04:55:21,479
But I don't see any chance

6180
04:55:21,479 --> 04:55:24,329
that our generation is going to avoid it.

6181
04:55:24,330 --> 04:55:25,740
Entropy is a powerful force,

6182
04:55:25,740 --> 04:55:30,740
and we are very ornate,
delicate, brittle DNA machines

6183
04:55:30,933 --> 04:55:33,690
that aren't up to the
cosmic ray bombardment

6184
04:55:33,689 --> 04:55:34,983
that we're subjected to.

6185
04:55:35,939 --> 04:55:37,772
So on the one hand,

6186
04:55:38,669 --> 04:55:43,112
every human that has ever
lived died or will die.

6187
04:55:44,639 --> 04:55:49,020
On the other hand, it's just
one of the hardest things

6188
04:55:49,020 --> 04:55:53,430
to imagine inflicting on anyone

6189
04:55:53,430 --> 04:55:55,860
that you love is having them gone.

6190
04:55:55,860 --> 04:55:58,860
I'm sure you've had friends
that aren't living anymore

6191
04:55:58,860 --> 04:56:01,293
and it's hard to even think about them.

6192
04:56:03,209 --> 04:56:08,209
And so I wish I had arrived
at the point of nirvana

6193
04:56:12,360 --> 04:56:14,790
where death doesn't have a sting.

6194
04:56:14,790 --> 04:56:17,673
I'm not worried about it,
but I can at least say

6195
04:56:17,672 --> 04:56:19,972
that I'm comfortable
with the certainty of it.

6196
04:56:21,209 --> 04:56:26,209
If not, having found out how
to take the tragedy out of it

6197
04:56:27,180 --> 04:56:31,349
when I think about my
kids either not having me

6198
04:56:31,349 --> 04:56:34,323
or me not having them or my wife.

6199
04:56:35,610 --> 04:56:36,720
- Maybe I have come to accepting

6200
04:56:36,720 --> 04:56:39,933
intellectual certainty of
it, but it may be the pain

6201
04:56:43,049 --> 04:56:45,360
that comes with losing
the people you love,

6202
04:56:45,360 --> 04:56:46,680
I don't think I've come to understand

6203
04:56:46,680 --> 04:56:51,389
the existential aspect of it.

6204
04:56:51,389 --> 04:56:54,264
Like that this is gonna end.

6205
04:56:54,264 --> 04:56:59,264
And I don't mean like in some trite way.

6206
04:56:59,909 --> 04:57:04,909
I mean like, it certainly feels
like it's not going to end.

6207
04:57:05,759 --> 04:57:08,159
Like you live life like
it's not going to end.

6208
04:57:08,159 --> 04:57:09,389
- [Matthew] Right.

6209
04:57:09,389 --> 04:57:10,889
- And the fact that this light

6210
04:57:10,889 --> 04:57:13,259
that's shining this consciousness

6211
04:57:13,259 --> 04:57:18,259
is going to no longer be,
in one moment, maybe today,

6212
04:57:20,340 --> 04:57:23,009
it fills me when I really am able

6213
04:57:23,009 --> 04:57:27,209
to load all that in with
Ernest Becker's terror.

6214
04:57:27,209 --> 04:57:28,529
Like it's a real fear.

6215
04:57:28,529 --> 04:57:30,539
I think people aren't always honest

6216
04:57:30,540 --> 04:57:32,583
with how terrifying it is.

6217
04:57:33,900 --> 04:57:35,220
I think the more you are able

6218
04:57:35,220 --> 04:57:38,220
to really think through it,
the more terrifying it is.

6219
04:57:38,220 --> 04:57:39,063
It's not such a simple thing.

6220
04:57:39,062 --> 04:57:41,312
Oh well, it's the way life is.

6221
04:57:42,180 --> 04:57:47,180
If you really can load that in, it's hard.

6222
04:57:47,520 --> 04:57:49,229
But I think that's why the stoics did it,

6223
04:57:49,229 --> 04:57:52,380
because it like helps you
get your shit together

6224
04:57:52,380 --> 04:57:55,319
and be like, well, the moment,

6225
04:57:55,319 --> 04:57:58,676
every single moment you're
alive is just beautiful.

6226
04:57:58,676 --> 04:58:01,233
And it's terrifying that it's gonna end,

6227
04:58:04,362 --> 04:58:07,590
like almost like you're
shivering in the cold

6228
04:58:07,590 --> 04:58:10,409
a child helpless, this kind of feeling.

6229
04:58:10,409 --> 04:58:13,290
And then it makes you,
when you have warmth,

6230
04:58:13,290 --> 04:58:14,370
when you have the safety,

6231
04:58:14,369 --> 04:58:16,983
when you have the love
to really appreciate it.

6232
04:58:18,509 --> 04:58:21,272
I feel like sometimes, in your position,

6233
04:58:22,290 --> 04:58:25,683
when you mentioned
armor, just to see death,

6234
04:58:26,790 --> 04:58:30,450
it might make you not be able to see that,

6235
04:58:30,450 --> 04:58:32,369
the finiteness of life,

6236
04:58:32,369 --> 04:58:36,779
because if you kept looking
at that, it might break you.

6237
04:58:36,779 --> 04:58:40,229
So it's good to know that you're kind of

6238
04:58:40,229 --> 04:58:42,336
still struggling with that,

6239
04:58:42,336 --> 04:58:45,779
that there's the neurosurgeon
and then there's a human.

6240
04:58:45,779 --> 04:58:48,506
And the human is still
able to struggle with that

6241
04:58:48,507 --> 04:58:51,569
and feel the fear of that
and the pain of that.

6242
04:58:51,569 --> 04:58:54,659
- Yeah, it definitely
makes you ask the question

6243
04:58:54,659 --> 04:58:59,250
of how long, how many
of these can you see?

6244
04:58:59,250 --> 04:59:02,516
And not say, "I can't do this anymore."

6245
04:59:07,049 --> 04:59:08,849
But I mean, you said it well.

6246
04:59:08,849 --> 04:59:12,959
I think it gives you an
opportunity to just appreciate

6247
04:59:12,959 --> 04:59:14,253
that you're alive today.

6248
04:59:16,020 --> 04:59:20,760
And I've got three kids
and an amazing wife

6249
04:59:20,759 --> 04:59:23,939
and I'm really happy.

6250
04:59:23,939 --> 04:59:24,930
Things are good.

6251
04:59:24,930 --> 04:59:27,209
I get to help on a project
that I think matters.

6252
04:59:27,209 --> 04:59:28,979
I think it moves us forward.

6253
04:59:28,979 --> 04:59:30,810
I'm a very lucky person.

6254
04:59:30,810 --> 04:59:33,340
- It's the early steps of a potentially

6255
04:59:35,159 --> 04:59:37,590
gigantic leap for humanity.

6256
04:59:37,590 --> 04:59:39,119
It's a really interesting one.

6257
04:59:39,119 --> 04:59:40,619
And it's cool 'cause like you,

6258
04:59:40,619 --> 04:59:42,329
you read about all this stuff in history

6259
04:59:42,330 --> 04:59:43,860
where it's like the early days.

6260
04:59:43,860 --> 04:59:46,229
I've been reading, before
going to the Amazon,

6261
04:59:46,229 --> 04:59:49,979
I would read about explorers
that would go and explore

6262
04:59:49,979 --> 04:59:52,950
even the Amazon jungle for the first time.

6263
04:59:52,950 --> 04:59:54,930
Those are the early steps.

6264
04:59:54,930 --> 04:59:56,639
Or early steps into space,

6265
04:59:56,639 --> 04:59:58,259
early steps in any discipline,

6266
04:59:58,259 --> 05:00:00,032
in physics and mathematics.

6267
05:00:01,229 --> 05:00:04,380
And it's cool 'cause this
is like, on the grand scale,

6268
05:00:04,380 --> 05:00:05,940
these are the early steps

6269
05:00:05,939 --> 05:00:09,479
into delving deep into the human brain.

6270
05:00:09,479 --> 05:00:11,009
So not just observing the brain,

6271
05:00:11,009 --> 05:00:13,769
but be able to interact
with the human brain.

6272
05:00:13,770 --> 05:00:14,939
It's gonna help a lot of people,

6273
05:00:14,939 --> 05:00:19,229
but it also might help us understand

6274
05:00:19,229 --> 05:00:20,759
what the hell's going on in there.

6275
05:00:20,759 --> 05:00:24,599
- Yeah, I think ultimately,
we wanna give people

6276
05:00:24,599 --> 05:00:26,612
more levers that they can pull, right?

6277
05:00:26,613 --> 05:00:28,923
Like you wanna give people options.

6278
05:00:29,759 --> 05:00:33,219
If you can give someone
a dial that they can turn

6279
05:00:34,290 --> 05:00:35,852
on how happy they are,

6280
05:00:37,709 --> 05:00:40,110
I think that makes people
really uncomfortable.

6281
05:00:40,110 --> 05:00:45,110
But now, talk about major
depressive disorder.

6282
05:00:45,599 --> 05:00:47,699
Talk about people that
are committing suicide

6283
05:00:47,700 --> 05:00:49,653
at an alarming rate in this country.

6284
05:00:50,490 --> 05:00:55,490
And try to justify that queasiness

6285
05:00:57,805 --> 05:01:02,159
in that light of you
can give people a knob

6286
05:01:02,159 --> 05:01:06,289
to take away suicidal
ideation, suicidal intention.

6287
05:01:06,289 --> 05:01:08,760
I would give them that knob.

6288
05:01:08,759 --> 05:01:11,411
I don't know how you
justify not doing that.

6289
05:01:11,412 --> 05:01:12,599
- Yeah, you can think about like

6290
05:01:12,599 --> 05:01:14,159
all the suffering that's
going on in the world.

6291
05:01:14,159 --> 05:01:15,389
Like every single human being

6292
05:01:15,389 --> 05:01:17,545
that's suffering right now,

6293
05:01:17,545 --> 05:01:18,719
it'll be a glowing red dot.

6294
05:01:18,720 --> 05:01:20,400
The more suffering, the more it's glowing.

6295
05:01:20,400 --> 05:01:22,800
And you just see the
map of human suffering,

6296
05:01:22,799 --> 05:01:26,009
and any technology that
allows you to dim that light

6297
05:01:26,009 --> 05:01:30,750
of suffering on a grand
scale is pretty exciting,

6298
05:01:30,750 --> 05:01:31,856
because there's a lot of people suffering

6299
05:01:31,856 --> 05:01:33,692
and most of them suffer quietly.

6300
05:01:37,380 --> 05:01:39,513
We look away too often,

6301
05:01:40,979 --> 05:01:44,159
and we should remember
those that are suffering,

6302
05:01:44,159 --> 05:01:46,770
'cause once again, most of
them are suffering quietly.

6303
05:01:46,770 --> 05:01:50,400
- Well, and on a grander
scale, the fabric of society,

6304
05:01:50,400 --> 05:01:52,890
people have a lot of complaints about

6305
05:01:52,889 --> 05:01:56,369
how our social fabric is working

6306
05:01:56,369 --> 05:01:59,319
or not working, how our politics
is working or not working.

6307
05:02:01,650 --> 05:02:05,940
Those things are made
of neurochemistry too,

6308
05:02:05,939 --> 05:02:07,079
in aggregate, right?

6309
05:02:07,080 --> 05:02:10,320
Like our politics is
composed of individuals

6310
05:02:10,319 --> 05:02:15,319
with human brains and, the
way it works or doesn't work

6311
05:02:15,930 --> 05:02:20,930
is potentially tunable in
the sense that, I don't know,

6312
05:02:20,970 --> 05:02:24,300
say remove our addictive behaviors

6313
05:02:24,299 --> 05:02:27,090
or tune our addictive
behaviors for social media

6314
05:02:27,090 --> 05:02:31,439
or our addiction to outrage,
our addiction to sharing

6315
05:02:31,439 --> 05:02:35,402
the most angry political
tweet we can find.

6316
05:02:37,979 --> 05:02:41,069
I don't think that leads
to a functional society.

6317
05:02:41,069 --> 05:02:45,016
And if you had options

6318
05:02:46,259 --> 05:02:51,122
for people to moderate
that maladaptive behavior,

6319
05:02:52,049 --> 05:02:54,270
there could be huge benefits to society.

6320
05:02:54,270 --> 05:02:56,369
Maybe we could all work together

6321
05:02:56,369 --> 05:03:00,029
a little more harmoniously
toward useful ends.

6322
05:03:00,029 --> 05:03:02,009
- There's a sweet spot,
like you mentioned,

6323
05:03:02,009 --> 05:03:04,500
you don't wanna completely
remove all the dark sides

6324
05:03:04,500 --> 05:03:08,819
of human nature 'cause those
kind of are somehow necessary

6325
05:03:08,819 --> 05:03:09,930
to make the whole thing work.

6326
05:03:09,930 --> 05:03:11,040
But there's a sweet spot.

6327
05:03:11,040 --> 05:03:12,240
- Yeah, I agree.

6328
05:03:12,240 --> 05:03:14,520
We gotta suffer a little,

6329
05:03:14,520 --> 05:03:16,500
just not so much that you lose hope.

6330
05:03:16,500 --> 05:03:17,430
- Yeah.

6331
05:03:17,430 --> 05:03:19,049
We knew all the surgeries you've done.

6332
05:03:19,049 --> 05:03:21,029
Have you seen consciousness in there ever?

6333
05:03:21,029 --> 05:03:22,579
Was there like a glowing light?

6334
05:03:23,654 --> 05:03:27,270
- I have this sense that I never found it.

6335
05:03:27,270 --> 05:03:31,233
Never removed it, like a
dementor in Harry Potter.

6336
05:03:32,729 --> 05:03:36,389
I have this sense that
consciousness is a lot less magical

6337
05:03:36,389 --> 05:03:39,363
than our instincts wanna claim it is.

6338
05:03:41,279 --> 05:03:45,719
It seems to me like a useful
analog for thinking about

6339
05:03:45,720 --> 05:03:48,573
what consciousness is in the brain,

6340
05:03:50,880 --> 05:03:55,440
is that we have a really
good intuitive understanding

6341
05:03:55,439 --> 05:03:59,009
of what it means to, say, touch your skin

6342
05:03:59,009 --> 05:04:00,509
and know what's being touched.

6343
05:04:02,490 --> 05:04:04,980
I think consciousness is just that level

6344
05:04:04,979 --> 05:04:06,389
of sensory mapping applied

6345
05:04:06,389 --> 05:04:10,139
to the thought processes
in the brain itself.

6346
05:04:10,139 --> 05:04:12,509
So what I'm saying is consciousness

6347
05:04:12,509 --> 05:04:17,509
is the sensation of some part
of your brain being active.

6348
05:04:17,729 --> 05:04:20,369
So you feel it working.

6349
05:04:20,369 --> 05:04:21,809
You feel the part of your brain

6350
05:04:21,810 --> 05:04:25,840
that thinks of red things
or winged creatures

6351
05:04:27,090 --> 05:04:29,790
or the taste of coffee.

6352
05:04:29,790 --> 05:04:33,389
You feel those parts of
your brain being active

6353
05:04:33,389 --> 05:04:36,809
the way that I'm feeling my
palm being touched, right?

6354
05:04:36,810 --> 05:04:41,810
And that sensory system
that feels the brain working

6355
05:04:42,540 --> 05:04:43,397
is consciousness.

6356
05:04:43,397 --> 05:04:45,299
- That's so brilliant.

6357
05:04:45,299 --> 05:04:48,149
It's the same way, it's
the sensation of touch

6358
05:04:48,150 --> 05:04:50,400
when you're touching a thing.

6359
05:04:50,400 --> 05:04:52,980
Consciousness is the sensation of you

6360
05:04:52,979 --> 05:04:56,909
feeling your brain working,
your brain thinking,

6361
05:04:56,909 --> 05:04:59,155
your brain perceiving.

6362
05:04:59,155 --> 05:05:03,239
- Which isn't like a
warping of space and time

6363
05:05:03,240 --> 05:05:06,060
or some quantum field effect, right?

6364
05:05:06,060 --> 05:05:07,110
It's nothing magical.

6365
05:05:07,110 --> 05:05:10,360
People always wanna
ascribe to consciousness

6366
05:05:11,400 --> 05:05:13,743
something truly different.

6367
05:05:14,580 --> 05:05:16,680
And there's this awesome long history

6368
05:05:16,680 --> 05:05:18,900
of people looking at whatever the latest

6369
05:05:18,900 --> 05:05:21,813
discovery in physics is
to explain consciousness,

6370
05:05:22,709 --> 05:05:24,119
because it's the most magical,

6371
05:05:24,119 --> 05:05:27,266
the most out there thing
that you can think of.

6372
05:05:27,266 --> 05:05:30,659
And people always wanna do
that with consciousness.

6373
05:05:30,659 --> 05:05:31,860
I don't think that's necessary.

6374
05:05:31,860 --> 05:05:34,950
It's just a very useful

6375
05:05:34,950 --> 05:05:38,280
and gratifying way of
feeling your brain work.

6376
05:05:38,279 --> 05:05:40,590
- And as we said, it's
one heck of a brain.

6377
05:05:40,590 --> 05:05:41,880
- [Matthew] Yeah.

6378
05:05:41,880 --> 05:05:43,979
- Everything we see around
us, everything we love,

6379
05:05:43,979 --> 05:05:44,939
everything that's beautiful,

6380
05:05:44,939 --> 05:05:48,659
it came from brains like these.

6381
05:05:48,659 --> 05:05:52,349
- It's all electrical activity
happening inside your skull.

6382
05:05:52,349 --> 05:05:56,789
- And I, for one, am grateful
that there's people like you

6383
05:05:56,790 --> 05:06:01,290
that are exploring all
the ways that it works

6384
05:06:01,290 --> 05:06:03,240
and all the ways it can be made better.

6385
05:06:04,111 --> 05:06:04,943
- Thanks, Lex.

6386
05:06:04,943 --> 05:06:06,360
- Thank you so much for talking today.

6387
05:06:06,360 --> 05:06:08,069
- It's been a joy.

6388
05:06:08,069 --> 05:06:09,869
Thanks for listening to this conversation

6389
05:06:09,869 --> 05:06:12,000
with Matthew MacDougall.

6390
05:06:12,000 --> 05:06:16,139
And now, dear friends,
here's Bliss Chapman,

6391
05:06:16,139 --> 05:06:20,069
Brain Interface Software
lead at Neuralink.

6392
05:06:20,069 --> 05:06:22,770
You told me that you've
met hundreds of people

6393
05:06:22,770 --> 05:06:25,619
with spinal cord injuries or with ALS

6394
05:06:25,619 --> 05:06:28,529
and that your motivation
for helping at Neuralink

6395
05:06:28,529 --> 05:06:30,629
is grounded in wanting to help them.

6396
05:06:30,630 --> 05:06:32,069
Can you describe this motivation?

6397
05:06:32,069 --> 05:06:32,902
- Yeah.

6398
05:06:32,902 --> 05:06:34,769
First, just a thank you to all the people

6399
05:06:34,770 --> 05:06:36,389
I've gotten a chance to speak with,

6400
05:06:36,389 --> 05:06:38,399
for sharing their stories with me.

6401
05:06:38,400 --> 05:06:41,700
I don't think there's any
world really in which I can

6402
05:06:41,700 --> 05:06:44,400
share their stories as
powerful way as they can.

6403
05:06:44,400 --> 05:06:47,310
But just I think to summarize
at a very high level

6404
05:06:47,310 --> 05:06:52,260
what I hear over and over
again is that people with ALS

6405
05:06:52,259 --> 05:06:54,299
or severe spinal cord injury in a place

6406
05:06:54,299 --> 05:06:57,090
where they basically can't
move physically anymore,

6407
05:06:57,090 --> 05:06:59,729
really at the end of the day
are looking for independence.

6408
05:06:59,729 --> 05:07:02,279
And that can mean different
things for different people.

6409
05:07:02,279 --> 05:07:04,709
For some folks, it can mean
the ability just to be able

6410
05:07:04,709 --> 05:07:06,869
to communicate again
independently without needing

6411
05:07:06,869 --> 05:07:09,629
to wear something on their face,
without needing a caretaker

6412
05:07:09,630 --> 05:07:11,880
to be able to put
something in their mouth.

6413
05:07:11,880 --> 05:07:13,950
For some folks, it can mean
independence to be able

6414
05:07:13,950 --> 05:07:17,639
to work again, to be able to
navigate a computer digitally,

6415
05:07:17,639 --> 05:07:19,259
efficiently enough to
be able to get a job,

6416
05:07:19,259 --> 05:07:21,959
to be able to support themself,
to be able to move out

6417
05:07:21,959 --> 05:07:23,340
and ultimately be able to support themself

6418
05:07:23,340 --> 05:07:25,529
after their family maybe
isn't there anymore

6419
05:07:25,529 --> 05:07:27,329
to take care of them.

6420
05:07:27,330 --> 05:07:29,670
And for some folks, it's as simple as

6421
05:07:29,669 --> 05:07:31,500
just being able to respond
to their kid in time

6422
05:07:31,500 --> 05:07:35,639
before they run away or get
interested in something else.

6423
05:07:35,639 --> 05:07:39,419
And these are deeply personal

6424
05:07:39,419 --> 05:07:42,419
and sort of very human problems.

6425
05:07:42,419 --> 05:07:44,399
And what strikes me again and again

6426
05:07:44,400 --> 05:07:46,050
when talking with these folks is that

6427
05:07:46,049 --> 05:07:48,509
this is actually an engineering problem.

6428
05:07:48,509 --> 05:07:50,939
This is a problem that
with the right resources,

6429
05:07:50,939 --> 05:07:54,270
with the right team, we can
make a lot of progress on.

6430
05:07:54,270 --> 05:07:56,467
And at the end of the day,

6431
05:07:56,467 --> 05:07:58,139
I think that's a deeply inspiring message

6432
05:07:58,139 --> 05:08:01,139
and something that makes me
excited to get up every day.

6433
05:08:01,139 --> 05:08:03,090
- So it's both an engineering problem

6434
05:08:03,090 --> 05:08:05,130
in terms of a BCI, for example,

6435
05:08:05,130 --> 05:08:06,930
that can give them capabilities

6436
05:08:06,930 --> 05:08:08,520
where they can interact with the world.

6437
05:08:08,520 --> 05:08:11,430
But also on the other side,
it's an engineering problem

6438
05:08:11,430 --> 05:08:13,529
for the rest of the world
to make it more accessible

6439
05:08:13,529 --> 05:08:15,930
for people living with quadriplegia.

6440
05:08:15,930 --> 05:08:18,270
- Yeah, and actually,
I'll take a broad view

6441
05:08:18,270 --> 05:08:19,560
sort of lens on this for a second.

6442
05:08:19,560 --> 05:08:22,409
I think I'm very in favor of anyone

6443
05:08:22,409 --> 05:08:23,610
working in this problem space.

6444
05:08:23,610 --> 05:08:26,430
So beyond BCI, I'm happy and excited

6445
05:08:26,430 --> 05:08:28,020
and willing to support any way I can

6446
05:08:28,020 --> 05:08:29,520
folks working on eye tracking systems,

6447
05:08:29,520 --> 05:08:31,680
working on speech to text systems,

6448
05:08:31,680 --> 05:08:34,979
working on head trackers or
mouse sticks or quad sticks.

6449
05:08:34,979 --> 05:08:36,149
And I've met many engineers

6450
05:08:36,150 --> 05:08:38,940
and folks in the community
that do exactly those things.

6451
05:08:38,939 --> 05:08:41,699
And I think for the people
we're trying to help,

6452
05:08:41,700 --> 05:08:43,860
it doesn't matter what the
complexity of the solution is

6453
05:08:43,860 --> 05:08:45,930
as long as the problem is solved.

6454
05:08:45,930 --> 05:08:47,580
And I wanna emphasize

6455
05:08:47,580 --> 05:08:49,590
that there can be many solutions out there

6456
05:08:49,590 --> 05:08:51,360
that can help with these problems.

6457
05:08:51,360 --> 05:08:54,930
And BCI is one of a
collection of such solutions.

6458
05:08:54,930 --> 05:08:56,099
So BCI, in particular,

6459
05:08:56,099 --> 05:08:58,199
I think offers several advantages here.

6460
05:08:58,200 --> 05:09:00,569
And I think the folks that
recognize this immediately

6461
05:09:00,569 --> 05:09:02,279
are usually the people who
have spinal cord injury

6462
05:09:02,279 --> 05:09:03,750
or some form of paralysis.

6463
05:09:03,750 --> 05:09:04,919
Usually, you don't have to explain to them

6464
05:09:04,919 --> 05:09:06,539
why this might be something
that could be helpful.

6465
05:09:06,540 --> 05:09:07,680
It's usually pretty self-evident.

6466
05:09:07,680 --> 05:09:10,080
But for the rest of us
folks that don't live

6467
05:09:10,080 --> 05:09:11,130
with severe spinal cord injury

6468
05:09:11,130 --> 05:09:14,069
or who don't know somebody with ALS,

6469
05:09:14,069 --> 05:09:16,229
it's not often obvious why
you would want a brain implant

6470
05:09:16,229 --> 05:09:18,720
to be able to connect
and navigate a computer.

6471
05:09:18,720 --> 05:09:19,552
And it's surprisingly nuanced,

6472
05:09:19,552 --> 05:09:22,380
and to the degree that
I've learned a huge amount

6473
05:09:22,380 --> 05:09:24,090
just working with Noland in the first

6474
05:09:24,090 --> 05:09:26,909
Neuralink clinical trial
and understanding from him

6475
05:09:26,909 --> 05:09:30,389
in his words why this
device is impactful for him.

6476
05:09:30,389 --> 05:09:31,619
And it's a nuanced topic.

6477
05:09:31,619 --> 05:09:33,809
It can be the case that
even if you can achieve

6478
05:09:33,810 --> 05:09:35,729
the same thing, for
example, with a mouse stick

6479
05:09:35,729 --> 05:09:37,950
when navigating a computer,
he doesn't have access

6480
05:09:37,950 --> 05:09:39,659
to that mouse stick every
single minute of the day.

6481
05:09:39,659 --> 05:09:41,220
He only has access when
someone's available

6482
05:09:41,220 --> 05:09:42,630
to put it in front of him.

6483
05:09:42,630 --> 05:09:44,250
And so a BCI can really offer a level

6484
05:09:44,250 --> 05:09:46,110
of independence and autonomy

6485
05:09:46,110 --> 05:09:50,130
that if it wasn't literally
physically part of your body,

6486
05:09:50,130 --> 05:09:52,380
it'd be hard to achieve in any other way.

6487
05:09:52,380 --> 05:09:54,900
- So there's a lot of fascinating aspects

6488
05:09:54,900 --> 05:09:57,000
to what it takes to get Noland to be able

6489
05:09:57,000 --> 05:09:59,790
to control a cursor on
the screen with his mind.

6490
05:09:59,790 --> 05:10:02,100
You texted me something that I just love.

6491
05:10:02,099 --> 05:10:03,449
You said, "I was part of the team

6492
05:10:03,450 --> 05:10:05,040
that interviewed and selected P1.

6493
05:10:05,040 --> 05:10:06,750
I was in the operating room

6494
05:10:06,750 --> 05:10:08,069
during the first human surgery

6495
05:10:08,069 --> 05:10:10,409
monitoring live signals
coming out of the brain.

6496
05:10:10,409 --> 05:10:12,930
I work with the user basically every day

6497
05:10:12,930 --> 05:10:16,080
to develop new UX paradigm's
decoding strategies.

6498
05:10:16,080 --> 05:10:18,960
And I was part of the
team that figured out

6499
05:10:18,959 --> 05:10:20,610
how to recover useful BCI

6500
05:10:20,610 --> 05:10:22,200
to new world record levels

6501
05:10:22,200 --> 05:10:24,600
when the signal quality degraded."

6502
05:10:24,599 --> 05:10:26,909
We'll talk about I think
every aspect of that,

6503
05:10:26,909 --> 05:10:29,819
but just zooming out, what was it like

6504
05:10:29,819 --> 05:10:34,819
to be part of that team
and part of that historic,

6505
05:10:36,389 --> 05:10:38,250
I would say, historic first?

6506
05:10:38,250 --> 05:10:39,779
- Yeah, I think for me,

6507
05:10:39,779 --> 05:10:41,219
this is something I've been excited about

6508
05:10:41,220 --> 05:10:42,977
for close to 10 years now.

6509
05:10:42,976 --> 05:10:45,719
And so to be able to be
even just some small part

6510
05:10:45,720 --> 05:10:49,380
of making it a reality
is extremely exciting.

6511
05:10:49,380 --> 05:10:53,760
A couple maybe special moments
during that whole process

6512
05:10:53,759 --> 05:10:56,399
that I'll never really truly forget,

6513
05:10:56,400 --> 05:10:59,193
one of them is during the actual surgery,

6514
05:11:01,018 --> 05:11:03,479
at that point in time, I
know Noland quite well.

6515
05:11:03,479 --> 05:11:04,456
I know his family.

6516
05:11:04,456 --> 05:11:07,709
And so I think the initial
reaction when Noland

6517
05:11:07,709 --> 05:11:08,849
is rolled into the operating room

6518
05:11:08,849 --> 05:11:11,789
is just a "oh shit" kind of reaction.

6519
05:11:11,790 --> 05:11:13,680
But at that point, muscle memory kicks in

6520
05:11:13,680 --> 05:11:15,093
and you sort of go into,

6521
05:11:16,380 --> 05:11:19,319
you let your body just do all the talking.

6522
05:11:19,319 --> 05:11:21,959
And I have the lucky job in
that particular procedure

6523
05:11:21,959 --> 05:11:24,389
to just be in charge of
monitoring the implant.

6524
05:11:24,389 --> 05:11:25,619
So my job is to sit there,

6525
05:11:25,619 --> 05:11:27,509
to look at the signals
coming off the implant,

6526
05:11:27,509 --> 05:11:29,819
to look at the live brain
data streaming off the device

6527
05:11:29,819 --> 05:11:31,829
as threads are being
inserted into the brain

6528
05:11:31,830 --> 05:11:32,970
and just to basically observe

6529
05:11:32,970 --> 05:11:35,250
and make sure that nothing is going wrong

6530
05:11:35,250 --> 05:11:37,020
or that there's no red
flags or fault conditions

6531
05:11:37,020 --> 05:11:38,010
that we need to go and investigate

6532
05:11:38,009 --> 05:11:40,889
or pause the surgery to debug.

6533
05:11:40,889 --> 05:11:43,979
And because I had that
sort of spectator view

6534
05:11:43,979 --> 05:11:45,989
of the surgery, I had a
slightly removed perspective

6535
05:11:45,990 --> 05:11:47,280
than I think most folks in the room.

6536
05:11:47,279 --> 05:11:49,296
I got to sit there and think to myself,

6537
05:11:49,296 --> 05:11:52,319
"Wow, that brain is moving a lot."

6538
05:11:52,319 --> 05:11:54,239
When you look into the
side look craniectomy,

6539
05:11:54,240 --> 05:11:55,953
that we stick the threads in,

6540
05:11:56,939 --> 05:11:59,369
one thing that most people don't
realize is the brain moves.

6541
05:11:59,369 --> 05:12:00,959
The brain moves a lot when you breathe,

6542
05:12:00,959 --> 05:12:04,919
when your heart beats, and
you can see it visibly.

6543
05:12:04,919 --> 05:12:08,069
So that's something that I
think was a surprise to me

6544
05:12:08,069 --> 05:12:11,700
and very, very exciting to be
able to see someone's brain

6545
05:12:11,700 --> 05:12:13,950
who you physically know and
have talked with at length

6546
05:12:13,950 --> 05:12:15,717
actually pulsing and
moving inside their skull.

6547
05:12:15,717 --> 05:12:18,510
- And they use that brain
to talk to you previously,

6548
05:12:18,509 --> 05:12:19,889
and now it's right there moving.

6549
05:12:19,889 --> 05:12:22,500
- Yep.
- Actually, I didn't realize

6550
05:12:22,500 --> 05:12:24,090
that in terms of the thread sending,

6551
05:12:24,090 --> 05:12:28,437
so the Neuralink implant
is active during surgery,

6552
05:12:28,437 --> 05:12:30,240
and one thread at a time,

6553
05:12:30,240 --> 05:12:31,950
you're able to start seeing the signal?

6554
05:12:31,950 --> 05:12:33,510
- Yeah.
- So that's part of the way

6555
05:12:33,509 --> 05:12:35,219
you test that the thing is working?

6556
05:12:35,220 --> 05:12:37,229
- Yeah, so actually in the operating room,

6557
05:12:37,229 --> 05:12:41,040
right after we sort of finished
all the thread insertions,

6558
05:12:41,040 --> 05:12:43,350
I started collecting what's
called broadband data.

6559
05:12:43,349 --> 05:12:46,979
So broadband is basically
the most raw form

6560
05:12:46,979 --> 05:12:49,259
of signal you can collect
from a Neuralink electrode.

6561
05:12:49,259 --> 05:12:50,819
It's essentially a measurement

6562
05:12:50,819 --> 05:12:53,310
of the local field potential

6563
05:12:53,310 --> 05:12:55,470
or the, yeah, the voltage essentially

6564
05:12:55,470 --> 05:12:57,090
measured by that electrode.

6565
05:12:57,090 --> 05:12:59,670
And we have a certain
mode in our application

6566
05:12:59,669 --> 05:13:02,039
that allows us to visualize
where detected spikes are.

6567
05:13:02,040 --> 05:13:04,830
So it visualizes sort of where,

6568
05:13:04,830 --> 05:13:05,663
in the broadband symbol,

6569
05:13:05,663 --> 05:13:07,350
and it's very, very raw form of the data

6570
05:13:07,349 --> 05:13:09,149
a neuron is actually spiking.

6571
05:13:09,150 --> 05:13:12,060
And so one of these moments
that I'll never forget

6572
05:13:12,060 --> 05:13:13,290
as part of this whole clinical trial

6573
05:13:13,290 --> 05:13:15,600
is seeing live in the operating room,

6574
05:13:15,599 --> 05:13:17,250
while he's still under anesthesia,

6575
05:13:17,250 --> 05:13:19,709
beautiful spikes being
shown in the application,

6576
05:13:19,709 --> 05:13:22,619
just streaming live to a
device I'm holding in my hand.

6577
05:13:22,619 --> 05:13:25,169
- So this is no signal
processing the raw data

6578
05:13:25,169 --> 05:13:27,029
and then the signals
processings on top of it,

6579
05:13:27,029 --> 05:13:28,590
you're seeing the spikes detected?

6580
05:13:28,590 --> 05:13:29,689
- [Bliss] Right, yeah.

6581
05:13:30,869 --> 05:13:33,899
- And that's a UX too because-
- Yes.

6582
05:13:33,900 --> 05:13:35,790
- That looks beautiful as well.

6583
05:13:35,790 --> 05:13:36,870
- During that procedure,

6584
05:13:36,869 --> 05:13:38,369
there was actually a lot
of cameramen in the room.

6585
05:13:38,369 --> 05:13:40,439
So they also were curious
and wanted to see.

6586
05:13:40,439 --> 05:13:42,029
There's several neurosurgeons in the room

6587
05:13:42,029 --> 05:13:44,219
who are all just excited to
see robots taking their job

6588
05:13:44,220 --> 05:13:47,639
and they're all crowded
around a small little iPhone

6589
05:13:47,639 --> 05:13:51,090
watching this live brain
data stream out of his brain.

6590
05:13:51,090 --> 05:13:53,130
- What was that like seeing the robot

6591
05:13:53,130 --> 05:13:54,060
do some of the surgery?

6592
05:13:54,060 --> 05:13:56,500
So the computer vision
aspect where it detects

6593
05:13:58,703 --> 05:14:01,590
all the spots that avoid the blood vessels

6594
05:14:01,590 --> 05:14:03,659
and then obviously with
the human supervision,

6595
05:14:03,659 --> 05:14:07,919
then actually doing the
really high precision

6596
05:14:07,919 --> 05:14:10,589
connection of the threads to the brain.

6597
05:14:10,590 --> 05:14:11,939
- That's a good question.

6598
05:14:11,939 --> 05:14:15,479
My answer's gonna be pretty
lame here, but it was boring.

6599
05:14:15,479 --> 05:14:17,340
I've seen it so many times.

6600
05:14:17,340 --> 05:14:19,449
Yeah, that's exactly how
you want surgery to be.

6601
05:14:19,449 --> 05:14:21,000
You want it to be boring,

6602
05:14:21,000 --> 05:14:22,439
because I've seen it so many times.

6603
05:14:22,439 --> 05:14:24,959
I've seen the robot do the surgery

6604
05:14:24,959 --> 05:14:26,969
literally hundreds of times,

6605
05:14:26,970 --> 05:14:29,250
and so it was just one more time.

6606
05:14:29,250 --> 05:14:32,490
- Yeah, all the practice
surgeries and the proxies

6607
05:14:32,490 --> 05:14:33,900
and this is just another day.

6608
05:14:33,900 --> 05:14:35,490
- Yep.

6609
05:14:35,490 --> 05:14:38,430
- So what about when Noland woke up?

6610
05:14:38,430 --> 05:14:41,700
Do you remember a moment where

6611
05:14:41,700 --> 05:14:44,340
he was able to move the
cursor, not move the cursor,

6612
05:14:44,340 --> 05:14:46,319
but get signal from the brain

6613
05:14:46,319 --> 05:14:49,770
such that it was able to show
that there's a connection?

6614
05:14:49,770 --> 05:14:50,729
- Yeah, yeah.

6615
05:14:50,729 --> 05:14:53,729
So we are quite excited to
move as quickly as we can,

6616
05:14:53,729 --> 05:14:56,159
and Noland was really, really
excited to get started.

6617
05:14:56,159 --> 05:14:58,560
He wanted to get started
actually the day of surgery,

6618
05:14:58,560 --> 05:15:02,370
but we waited till the next
morning very patiently.

6619
05:15:02,369 --> 05:15:03,202
So a long night.

6620
05:15:04,560 --> 05:15:08,490
And the next morning in the
ICU, where he was recovering,

6621
05:15:08,490 --> 05:15:11,460
he wanted to get started and
actually start to understand

6622
05:15:11,459 --> 05:15:14,250
what kind of signal we can
measure from his brain.

6623
05:15:14,250 --> 05:15:15,930
And maybe for folks who are not familiar

6624
05:15:15,930 --> 05:15:19,319
with the Neuralink system, we
implant the Neuralink system

6625
05:15:19,319 --> 05:15:21,630
or the Neuralink implant
in the motor cortex.

6626
05:15:21,630 --> 05:15:22,799
So the motor cortex is responsible

6627
05:15:22,799 --> 05:15:25,829
for representing things like motor intent,

6628
05:15:25,830 --> 05:15:28,140
sort of if you imagine
closing and opening your hand,

6629
05:15:28,139 --> 05:15:29,220
that kind of signal representation

6630
05:15:29,220 --> 05:15:31,409
would be present in the motor cortex.

6631
05:15:31,409 --> 05:15:33,419
If you imagine moving
your arm back and forth

6632
05:15:33,419 --> 05:15:35,339
or wiggling a pinky, this sort of signal

6633
05:15:35,340 --> 05:15:37,139
can be present in the motor cortex.

6634
05:15:37,139 --> 05:15:39,540
So one of the ways we
start to sort of map out,

6635
05:15:39,540 --> 05:15:41,400
what kind of signal do we
actually have access to

6636
05:15:41,400 --> 05:15:42,870
in any particular individual's brain

6637
05:15:42,869 --> 05:15:44,819
is through this task called body mapping.

6638
05:15:44,819 --> 05:15:46,500
And body mapping is where
you essentially present

6639
05:15:46,500 --> 05:15:47,437
a visual to the user and you say,

6640
05:15:47,437 --> 05:15:49,620
"Hey, imagine doing this."

6641
05:15:49,619 --> 05:15:53,129
And that visual is a 3D
hand opening and closing,

6642
05:15:53,130 --> 05:15:55,710
or index finger modulating up and down.

6643
05:15:55,709 --> 05:15:57,419
And you ask the user to imagine that,

6644
05:15:57,419 --> 05:15:58,666
and obviously, you can't see them do this,

6645
05:15:58,667 --> 05:16:00,810
'cause they're paralyzed
so you can't see them

6646
05:16:00,810 --> 05:16:03,507
actually move their arm,
but while they do this task,

6647
05:16:03,507 --> 05:16:05,670
you can record neural activity,

6648
05:16:05,669 --> 05:16:07,919
and you can basically
offline model and check,

6649
05:16:07,919 --> 05:16:10,469
can I predict or can I
detect the modulation

6650
05:16:10,470 --> 05:16:12,360
corresponding with
those different actions?

6651
05:16:12,360 --> 05:16:13,740
And so we did that task and we realized,

6652
05:16:13,740 --> 05:16:15,480
hey, there's actually some modulation

6653
05:16:15,479 --> 05:16:17,159
associated with some of his hand motion,

6654
05:16:17,159 --> 05:16:18,930
which was the first indication that, okay,

6655
05:16:18,930 --> 05:16:20,400
we can potentially use that modulation

6656
05:16:20,400 --> 05:16:22,290
to do useful things in the world.

6657
05:16:22,290 --> 05:16:24,330
For example, control a computer cursor.

6658
05:16:24,330 --> 05:16:26,250
And he started playing with it,

6659
05:16:26,250 --> 05:16:27,180
the first time we showed him it,

6660
05:16:27,180 --> 05:16:28,680
and we actually just
took the same live view

6661
05:16:28,680 --> 05:16:30,689
of his brain activity and
put it in front of him.

6662
05:16:30,689 --> 05:16:33,329
And we said, "Hey, you
tell us what's going on.

6663
05:16:33,330 --> 05:16:34,163
We're not you.

6664
05:16:34,163 --> 05:16:36,209
You're able to imagine different things,

6665
05:16:36,209 --> 05:16:38,099
and we know that it's
modulating some of these neurons

6666
05:16:38,099 --> 05:16:39,659
so you figure out for us

6667
05:16:39,659 --> 05:16:41,669
what that is actually representing."

6668
05:16:41,669 --> 05:16:43,109
And so he played with it for a bit.

6669
05:16:43,110 --> 05:16:44,850
He was like, "I don't quite get it yet."

6670
05:16:44,849 --> 05:16:46,169
He played for a bit longer.

6671
05:16:46,169 --> 05:16:49,079
And he said, "Oh, when I move this finger,

6672
05:16:49,080 --> 05:16:51,657
I see this particular
neuron start to fire more."

6673
05:16:51,656 --> 05:16:53,819
And I said, okay, "Prove it, do it again."

6674
05:16:53,819 --> 05:16:56,849
And so he said, "Okay,
three, two, one, boom."

6675
05:16:56,849 --> 05:16:59,759
And the minute he moved, you
can see like instantaneously

6676
05:16:59,759 --> 05:17:01,859
this neuron is firing - single neuron.

6677
05:17:01,860 --> 05:17:02,819
I can tell you the exact

6678
05:17:02,819 --> 05:17:04,349
channel number if you're interested.

6679
05:17:04,349 --> 05:17:06,059
It's stuck in my brain now forever.

6680
05:17:06,060 --> 05:17:09,120
But that single channel firing
was a beautiful indication

6681
05:17:09,119 --> 05:17:11,700
that it was behaved really
modulated neural activity

6682
05:17:11,700 --> 05:17:13,350
that could then be used
for downstream tasks

6683
05:17:13,349 --> 05:17:15,090
like decoding a computer cursor.

6684
05:17:15,090 --> 05:17:16,319
- And when you say single channel,

6685
05:17:16,319 --> 05:17:18,659
is that associated with
a single electrode?

6686
05:17:18,659 --> 05:17:20,819
- Yeah, channel electrode
are interchangeable.

6687
05:17:20,819 --> 05:17:22,672
- And there's 1,024 of those?

6688
05:17:23,544 --> 05:17:24,903
- 1,024, yeah.

6689
05:17:25,776 --> 05:17:28,280
- That's incredible that that works.

6690
05:17:28,279 --> 05:17:32,592
When I was learning about all
this and like loading it in,

6691
05:17:33,630 --> 05:17:36,299
it was just blowing my
mind that the intention,

6692
05:17:36,299 --> 05:17:39,003
you can visualize yourself
moving the finger,

6693
05:17:39,900 --> 05:17:41,670
that can turn into a signal,

6694
05:17:41,669 --> 05:17:43,799
and the fact that you
can then skip that step

6695
05:17:43,799 --> 05:17:45,700
and visualize the cursor moving

6696
05:17:46,740 --> 05:17:49,230
or have the intention of the cursor moving

6697
05:17:49,229 --> 05:17:50,669
and that leading to a signal

6698
05:17:50,669 --> 05:17:52,719
that can then be used to move the cursor,

6699
05:17:54,243 --> 05:17:56,250
there is so many exciting things there

6700
05:17:56,250 --> 05:17:59,009
to learn about the brain,
about the way the brain works,

6701
05:17:59,009 --> 05:18:01,409
the very fact of their existing signal

6702
05:18:01,409 --> 05:18:03,389
that can be used is really powerful.

6703
05:18:03,389 --> 05:18:05,819
But it feels like that's
just like the beginning

6704
05:18:05,819 --> 05:18:07,919
of figuring out how that
signal could be used

6705
05:18:07,919 --> 05:18:09,269
really, really effectively.

6706
05:18:10,560 --> 05:18:11,790
I should also just,

6707
05:18:11,790 --> 05:18:13,380
there's so many fascinating details here,

6708
05:18:13,380 --> 05:18:15,782
but you mentioned the body mapping step.

6709
05:18:16,889 --> 05:18:21,029
At least in the version I saw
that Noland was showing off,

6710
05:18:21,029 --> 05:18:23,189
there's like a super nice interface,

6711
05:18:23,189 --> 05:18:24,026
like a graphical interface.

6712
05:18:24,026 --> 05:18:26,669
But like it just felt like
I was like in the future

6713
05:18:26,669 --> 05:18:28,393
'cause it like, you know,

6714
05:18:28,393 --> 05:18:32,159
I guess it visualizes you moving the hand.

6715
05:18:32,159 --> 05:18:37,159
And there's very like a
sexy, polished interface.

6716
05:18:38,040 --> 05:18:39,630
Hello.

6717
05:18:39,630 --> 05:18:41,010
I don't know if there's a voice component,

6718
05:18:41,009 --> 05:18:44,312
but it just felt like when you wake up

6719
05:18:44,312 --> 05:18:46,709
in a really nice video
game and this is a tutorial

6720
05:18:46,709 --> 05:18:48,336
at the beginning of that video game.

6721
05:18:48,336 --> 05:18:49,652
"This is what you're supposed to do."

6722
05:18:49,652 --> 05:18:50,549
It's cool.

6723
05:18:50,549 --> 05:18:52,259
- No, I mean, the future
should feel like the future.

6724
05:18:52,259 --> 05:18:53,879
- But it's not easy to pull that off.

6725
05:18:53,880 --> 05:18:57,240
I mean, it needs to be
simple but not too simple.

6726
05:18:57,240 --> 05:18:59,760
- Yeah, and I think the
UX design component here

6727
05:18:59,759 --> 05:19:03,209
is underrated for BCI
development in general.

6728
05:19:03,209 --> 05:19:06,090
There's a whole interaction effect

6729
05:19:06,090 --> 05:19:07,860
between the ways in which you visualize

6730
05:19:07,860 --> 05:19:09,750
an instruction to the user

6731
05:19:09,750 --> 05:19:11,430
and the kinds of signal you can get back.

6732
05:19:11,430 --> 05:19:13,740
And that quality of sort of
your behavioral alignment

6733
05:19:13,740 --> 05:19:15,420
to the neural signal is a function

6734
05:19:15,419 --> 05:19:16,709
of how good you are at expressing

6735
05:19:16,709 --> 05:19:18,299
to the user what you want them to do.

6736
05:19:18,299 --> 05:19:21,139
And so yeah, we spend a lot
of time thinking about the UX,

6737
05:19:21,139 --> 05:19:22,470
of how we build our applications,

6738
05:19:22,470 --> 05:19:23,970
of how the decoder actually functions,

6739
05:19:23,970 --> 05:19:25,979
the control surfaces it
provides to the user.

6740
05:19:25,979 --> 05:19:27,720
All these little details matter a lot.

6741
05:19:27,720 --> 05:19:30,930
- So maybe it'd be nice to get
into a little bit more detail

6742
05:19:30,930 --> 05:19:32,880
of what the signal looks like

6743
05:19:32,880 --> 05:19:34,159
and what the decoding looks like.

6744
05:19:34,159 --> 05:19:39,159
So there's a N1 implant
that has, like we mentioned,

6745
05:19:41,082 --> 05:19:46,082
1,024 electrodes and that's
collecting raw data, raw signal.

6746
05:19:46,740 --> 05:19:48,720
What does that signal look like,

6747
05:19:48,720 --> 05:19:51,900
and what are the different
steps along the way

6748
05:19:51,900 --> 05:19:54,600
before it's transmitted,
and what is transmitted,

6749
05:19:54,599 --> 05:19:55,432
all that kind of stuff?

6750
05:19:55,433 --> 05:19:56,639
- Yeah, yep.

6751
05:19:56,639 --> 05:19:58,439
This is gonna be a fun one.

6752
05:19:58,439 --> 05:19:59,489
Let's go.

6753
05:19:59,490 --> 05:20:02,940
So maybe before diving into what we do,

6754
05:20:02,939 --> 05:20:04,619
it's worth understanding
what we're trying to measure,

6755
05:20:04,619 --> 05:20:07,020
because that dictates a
lot of the requirements

6756
05:20:07,020 --> 05:20:08,970
for the system that we build.

6757
05:20:08,970 --> 05:20:09,900
And what we're trying to measure

6758
05:20:09,900 --> 05:20:12,630
is really individual neurons
producing action potentials.

6759
05:20:12,630 --> 05:20:14,580
And action potential
is, you can think of it

6760
05:20:14,580 --> 05:20:16,590
like a little electrical impulse

6761
05:20:16,590 --> 05:20:19,349
that you can detect if
you're close enough.

6762
05:20:19,349 --> 05:20:21,869
And by being close enough,
I mean, like within

6763
05:20:21,869 --> 05:20:24,360
let's say 100 microns of that cell.

6764
05:20:24,360 --> 05:20:26,400
And 100 microns is a
very, very tiny distance.

6765
05:20:26,400 --> 05:20:29,760
And so the number of neurons
that you're gonna pick up

6766
05:20:29,759 --> 05:20:30,959
with any given electrode

6767
05:20:30,959 --> 05:20:33,659
is just a small radius
around that electrode.

6768
05:20:33,659 --> 05:20:35,340
And the other thing worth understanding

6769
05:20:35,340 --> 05:20:36,470
about the underlying biology here

6770
05:20:36,470 --> 05:20:38,610
is that when neurons
produce an action potential,

6771
05:20:38,610 --> 05:20:41,520
the width of that action potential
is about one millisecond.

6772
05:20:41,520 --> 05:20:43,260
So from the start of the
spike to the end of the spike,

6773
05:20:43,259 --> 05:20:46,949
that whole width of that sort
of characteristic feature

6774
05:20:46,950 --> 05:20:50,069
of a neuron firing is
one millisecond wide.

6775
05:20:50,069 --> 05:20:52,829
And if you want to detect
that an individual spike

6776
05:20:52,830 --> 05:20:55,770
is occurring or not, you
need to sample that signal

6777
05:20:55,770 --> 05:20:58,500
or sample the local full
potential nearby that neuron

6778
05:20:58,500 --> 05:20:59,909
much more frequently
than once a millisecond.

6779
05:20:59,909 --> 05:21:02,759
You need to sample many,
many times per millisecond

6780
05:21:02,759 --> 05:21:04,619
to be able to detect that this is actually

6781
05:21:04,619 --> 05:21:05,819
the characteristic waveform

6782
05:21:05,819 --> 05:21:07,676
of a neuron producing an action potential.

6783
05:21:07,676 --> 05:21:11,279
And so we sample across
all 1,024 electrodes

6784
05:21:11,279 --> 05:21:13,110
about 20,000 times a second.

6785
05:21:13,110 --> 05:21:14,500
20,000 times a second means

6786
05:21:14,500 --> 05:21:16,409
we've already given
one millisecond window.

6787
05:21:16,409 --> 05:21:18,720
We have about 20 samples that tell us

6788
05:21:18,720 --> 05:21:22,020
what that exact shape of that
action potential looks like.

6789
05:21:22,020 --> 05:21:25,560
And once we've sort of
sampled at super high rate

6790
05:21:25,560 --> 05:21:29,460
the underlying electrical
field nearby these cells,

6791
05:21:29,459 --> 05:21:31,860
we can process that signal into

6792
05:21:31,860 --> 05:21:34,860
just where do we detect a
spike or where do we not,

6793
05:21:34,860 --> 05:21:36,420
sort of a binary signal one or zero.

6794
05:21:36,419 --> 05:21:39,059
Do we detect a spike in
this one millisecond or not?

6795
05:21:39,060 --> 05:21:43,510
And we do that because the
actual information carrying

6796
05:21:44,880 --> 05:21:47,280
sort of subspace of neural activity

6797
05:21:47,279 --> 05:21:49,409
is just when are spikes occurring.

6798
05:21:49,409 --> 05:21:50,909
Essentially, everything that we care about

6799
05:21:50,909 --> 05:21:52,590
for decoding can be
captured or represented

6800
05:21:52,590 --> 05:21:55,319
in the frequency
characteristics of spike trains,

6801
05:21:55,319 --> 05:21:57,029
meaning how often are spikes

6802
05:21:57,029 --> 05:21:59,399
firing in any given window of time.

6803
05:21:59,400 --> 05:22:01,620
And so that allows us to
do sort of a crazy amount

6804
05:22:01,619 --> 05:22:05,573
of compression from this very
rich, high density signal

6805
05:22:07,380 --> 05:22:09,000
to something that's much, much more sparse

6806
05:22:09,000 --> 05:22:12,299
and compressible that can be
sent out over a wireless radio,

6807
05:22:12,299 --> 05:22:14,069
like a Bluetooth
communication, for example.

6808
05:22:14,069 --> 05:22:16,349
- Quick tangents here.

6809
05:22:16,349 --> 05:22:20,069
You mentioned electrode neuron.

6810
05:22:20,069 --> 05:22:23,523
There's a local neighborhood
of neurons nearby.

6811
05:22:24,450 --> 05:22:27,810
How difficult is it to like isolate

6812
05:22:27,810 --> 05:22:30,479
from where the spike came from?

6813
05:22:30,479 --> 05:22:33,209
- Yeah, so there's a whole
field of sort of academic

6814
05:22:33,209 --> 05:22:35,250
neuroscience work on exactly this problem,

6815
05:22:35,250 --> 05:22:37,979
of basically given a single electrode

6816
05:22:37,979 --> 05:22:40,770
or given a set of electrodes
measuring a set of neurons,

6817
05:22:40,770 --> 05:22:42,119
how can you sort of sort,

6818
05:22:42,119 --> 05:22:46,110
spike sort which spikes are
coming from what neuron?

6819
05:22:46,110 --> 05:22:48,450
And this is a problem that's
pursued in academic work

6820
05:22:48,450 --> 05:22:51,530
because you care about it for
understanding what's going on

6821
05:22:51,529 --> 05:22:55,259
in the underlying sort of
neuroscience of the brain.

6822
05:22:55,259 --> 05:22:56,369
If you care about understanding

6823
05:22:56,369 --> 05:22:58,139
how the brain's representing information,

6824
05:22:58,139 --> 05:22:59,790
how that's evolving through time,

6825
05:22:59,790 --> 05:23:02,760
then that's a very, very
important question to understand.

6826
05:23:02,759 --> 05:23:05,159
For sort of the
engineering side of things,

6827
05:23:05,159 --> 05:23:06,119
at least at the current scale,

6828
05:23:06,119 --> 05:23:10,379
if the number of neurons per
electrode is relatively small,

6829
05:23:10,380 --> 05:23:11,580
you can get away with basically

6830
05:23:11,580 --> 05:23:13,080
ignoring that problem completely.

6831
05:23:13,080 --> 05:23:15,090
You can think of it like
sort of a random projection

6832
05:23:15,090 --> 05:23:16,889
of neurons to electrodes,

6833
05:23:16,889 --> 05:23:18,239
and there may be in some cases

6834
05:23:18,240 --> 05:23:19,590
more than one neuron per electrode.

6835
05:23:19,590 --> 05:23:21,090
But if that number is small enough,

6836
05:23:21,090 --> 05:23:22,790
those signals can be thought of as

6837
05:23:23,700 --> 05:23:25,440
sort of a union of the two.

6838
05:23:25,439 --> 05:23:27,359
And for many applications,
that's a totally reasonable

6839
05:23:27,360 --> 05:23:30,330
trade off to make and can
simplify the problem a lot.

6840
05:23:30,330 --> 05:23:31,980
And as you sort of
scale out channel count,

6841
05:23:31,979 --> 05:23:34,950
the relevance of distinguishing
individual neurons

6842
05:23:34,950 --> 05:23:36,923
becomes less important, because
you have more overall signal

6843
05:23:36,922 --> 05:23:39,659
and you can start to rely
on sort of correlations

6844
05:23:39,659 --> 05:23:41,819
or covariance structure in
the data to help understand

6845
05:23:41,819 --> 05:23:43,326
when that channel's firing,

6846
05:23:43,326 --> 05:23:45,720
what does that actually represent?

6847
05:23:45,720 --> 05:23:47,100
'Cause you know that when
that channel's firing

6848
05:23:47,099 --> 05:23:49,319
in concert with these other 50 channels,

6849
05:23:49,319 --> 05:23:50,549
that means move left.

6850
05:23:50,549 --> 05:23:52,139
But when that same channel's
firing with concert

6851
05:23:52,139 --> 05:23:54,299
with these other 10 channels,
that means move right.

6852
05:23:54,299 --> 05:23:56,639
- Okay, so you have to do
this kind of spike detection

6853
05:23:56,639 --> 05:24:01,139
on board, and you have to
do that super efficiently,

6854
05:24:01,139 --> 05:24:03,916
so fast and not use too much power,

6855
05:24:03,917 --> 05:24:05,940
'cause you don't wanna be
generating too much heat.

6856
05:24:05,939 --> 05:24:09,329
So it has to be a super
simple signal processing step.

6857
05:24:09,330 --> 05:24:10,163
- [Bliss] Yeah.

6858
05:24:11,880 --> 05:24:15,302
- Is there some wisdom you can share about

6859
05:24:15,302 --> 05:24:17,490
what it takes to overcome that challenge?

6860
05:24:17,490 --> 05:24:20,190
- Yeah, so we've tried
many different versions

6861
05:24:20,189 --> 05:24:23,789
of basically turning this raw signal into

6862
05:24:23,790 --> 05:24:26,069
sort of a feature that you
might wanna send off the device.

6863
05:24:26,069 --> 05:24:27,209
And I'll say that I don't think

6864
05:24:27,209 --> 05:24:28,739
we're at the final step of this process.

6865
05:24:28,740 --> 05:24:29,940
This is a long journey.

6866
05:24:29,939 --> 05:24:31,739
We have something that
works clearly today,

6867
05:24:31,740 --> 05:24:33,870
but there can be many
approaches that we find

6868
05:24:33,869 --> 05:24:34,739
in the future that are much better

6869
05:24:34,740 --> 05:24:36,270
than what we do right now.

6870
05:24:36,270 --> 05:24:38,490
So some versions of what we do right now,

6871
05:24:38,490 --> 05:24:41,130
and there's a lot of academic
heritage to these ideas,

6872
05:24:41,130 --> 05:24:43,020
so I don't wanna claim
that these are original

6873
05:24:43,020 --> 05:24:44,729
Neuralink ideas or anything like that.

6874
05:24:44,729 --> 05:24:47,159
But one of these ideas
is basically to build

6875
05:24:47,159 --> 05:24:49,979
a sort of like a convolutional
filter almost, if you will,

6876
05:24:49,979 --> 05:24:51,090
that slides across the signal

6877
05:24:51,090 --> 05:24:54,299
and looks for a certain
template to be matched.

6878
05:24:54,299 --> 05:24:56,819
And that template consists
of sort of how deep

6879
05:24:56,819 --> 05:24:59,340
the spike modulates, how much it recovers,

6880
05:24:59,340 --> 05:25:01,380
and what the duration
and window of time is

6881
05:25:01,380 --> 05:25:02,970
that the whole process takes.

6882
05:25:02,970 --> 05:25:04,650
And if you can see in the
signal that that template

6883
05:25:04,650 --> 05:25:06,480
is matched within certain bounds,

6884
05:25:06,479 --> 05:25:08,610
then you can say, "Okay, that's a spike."

6885
05:25:08,610 --> 05:25:10,619
One reason that approach
is super convenient

6886
05:25:10,619 --> 05:25:12,959
is that you can actually implement that

6887
05:25:12,959 --> 05:25:14,700
extremely efficiently in hardware,

6888
05:25:14,700 --> 05:25:17,819
which means that you
can run it in low power

6889
05:25:17,819 --> 05:25:20,520
across 1,024 channels all at once.

6890
05:25:20,520 --> 05:25:23,310
Another approach that we've
recently started exploring,

6891
05:25:23,310 --> 05:25:26,040
and this can be combined with
the spike detection approach,

6892
05:25:26,040 --> 05:25:27,479
something called spike band power.

6893
05:25:27,479 --> 05:25:28,829
And the benefits of that approach

6894
05:25:28,830 --> 05:25:32,310
are that you may be able to
pick up some signal from neurons

6895
05:25:32,310 --> 05:25:34,620
that are maybe too far away
to be detected as a spike,

6896
05:25:34,619 --> 05:25:36,719
because the farther away
you are from an electrode,

6897
05:25:36,720 --> 05:25:38,850
the weaker that actual spike waveform

6898
05:25:38,849 --> 05:25:40,649
will look like on that electrode.

6899
05:25:40,650 --> 05:25:43,380
So you might be able to pick up

6900
05:25:43,380 --> 05:25:45,600
population level activity
of things that are

6901
05:25:45,599 --> 05:25:47,939
maybe slightly outside the
normal recording radius,

6902
05:25:47,939 --> 05:25:50,219
what neuroscientists
sometimes refer to as the hash

6903
05:25:50,220 --> 05:25:53,130
of activity, the other
stuff that's going on,

6904
05:25:53,130 --> 05:25:55,049
and you can look at sort
of across many channels

6905
05:25:55,049 --> 05:25:57,270
how that sort of background
noise is behaving

6906
05:25:57,270 --> 05:25:58,350
and you might be able to get more juice

6907
05:25:58,349 --> 05:25:59,549
out of the signal that way.

6908
05:25:59,549 --> 05:26:00,450
But it comes at a cost.

6909
05:26:00,450 --> 05:26:02,400
That signal is now a floating
point representation,

6910
05:26:02,400 --> 05:26:04,650
which means it's more expensive
to send out over a power.

6911
05:26:04,650 --> 05:26:07,470
It means you have to find
different ways to compress it

6912
05:26:07,470 --> 05:26:08,819
that are different than what you can apply

6913
05:26:08,819 --> 05:26:09,832
to binary signals.

6914
05:26:09,832 --> 05:26:10,770
So there's a lot of different challenges

6915
05:26:10,770 --> 05:26:12,060
associated with these
different modalities.

6916
05:26:12,060 --> 05:26:14,580
- So also, in terms of communication,

6917
05:26:14,580 --> 05:26:17,227
you're limited by the
amount of data you can send.

6918
05:26:17,226 --> 05:26:19,076
- [Bliss] Yeah.

6919
05:26:19,077 --> 05:26:20,880
- And also, because you're currently using

6920
05:26:20,880 --> 05:26:23,733
the Bluetooth protocol, you
have to batch stuff together.

6921
05:26:25,110 --> 05:26:29,610
But you have to also do this
keeping the latency crazy low.

6922
05:26:29,610 --> 05:26:31,020
Like crazy low.

6923
05:26:31,020 --> 05:26:32,909
Anything to say about the latency?

6924
05:26:32,909 --> 05:26:34,860
- Yeah, this is a passion project of mine,

6925
05:26:34,860 --> 05:26:38,340
so I wanna build the
best mouse in the world.

6926
05:26:38,340 --> 05:26:41,009
I don't wanna build like the, you know,

6927
05:26:41,009 --> 05:26:43,139
the Chevrolet Spark or
whatever of electric cars.

6928
05:26:43,139 --> 05:26:46,680
I wanna build like the Tesla
Roadster version of a mouse.

6929
05:26:46,680 --> 05:26:49,349
And I really do think it's quite possible

6930
05:26:49,349 --> 05:26:51,000
that within 5 to 10 years,

6931
05:26:51,000 --> 05:26:52,860
that most eSports
competitions are dominated

6932
05:26:52,860 --> 05:26:54,569
by people with paralysis.

6933
05:26:54,569 --> 05:26:56,790
This is like a very real
possibility for number of reasons.

6934
05:26:56,790 --> 05:26:59,670
One is that they'll have
access to the best technology

6935
05:26:59,669 --> 05:27:01,379
to play video games effectively.

6936
05:27:01,380 --> 05:27:02,769
The second is they have the time to do so.

6937
05:27:02,769 --> 05:27:04,529
So those two factors together

6938
05:27:04,529 --> 05:27:07,379
are particularly potent
for eSport competitors.

6939
05:27:07,380 --> 05:27:11,040
- Unless people without paralysis

6940
05:27:11,040 --> 05:27:12,606
are also allowed to implant.

6941
05:27:12,606 --> 05:27:13,439
- (laughs) Right.

6942
05:27:13,439 --> 05:27:16,829
- Which is, it is another way to interact

6943
05:27:16,830 --> 05:27:20,160
with a digital device.

6944
05:27:20,159 --> 05:27:22,079
And there's something to that,

6945
05:27:22,080 --> 05:27:24,810
if it's a fundamentally
different experience,

6946
05:27:24,810 --> 05:27:26,280
more efficient experience.

6947
05:27:26,279 --> 05:27:28,259
Even if it's not like some kinda

6948
05:27:28,259 --> 05:27:30,689
full on high bandwidth communication,

6949
05:27:30,689 --> 05:27:35,669
if it's just the ability to
move the mouse 10x faster,

6950
05:27:35,669 --> 05:27:37,829
like the bits per second,

6951
05:27:37,830 --> 05:27:39,390
if I can achieve a bits per second,

6952
05:27:39,389 --> 05:27:41,340
that 10x, what I can do with the mouse,

6953
05:27:41,340 --> 05:27:43,950
that's a really interesting
possibility of what that can do,

6954
05:27:43,950 --> 05:27:47,760
especially as you get really
good at it with training.

6955
05:27:47,759 --> 05:27:48,774
- It's definitely the case

6956
05:27:48,775 --> 05:27:51,000
that you have a higher
ceiling performance,

6957
05:27:51,000 --> 05:27:52,740
because you don't have
to buffer your intention

6958
05:27:52,740 --> 05:27:54,540
through your arm, through your muscle.

6959
05:27:54,540 --> 05:27:57,180
You get just, by nature of
having a brain implant at all,

6960
05:27:57,180 --> 05:28:00,090
like 75 millisecond
lead time on any action

6961
05:28:00,090 --> 05:28:01,500
that you're actually trying to take.

6962
05:28:01,500 --> 05:28:02,402
And there's some nuance to this,

6963
05:28:02,402 --> 05:28:04,169
like there's evidence
that the motor cortex,

6964
05:28:04,169 --> 05:28:06,119
you can sort of plan
out sequences of action

6965
05:28:06,119 --> 05:28:08,309
so you may not get that
whole benefit all the time.

6966
05:28:08,310 --> 05:28:11,190
But for sort of like
reaction time style games

6967
05:28:11,189 --> 05:28:12,029
where you just wanna,

6968
05:28:12,029 --> 05:28:15,329
somebody's over here, snipe
'em, that kind of thing.

6969
05:28:15,330 --> 05:28:17,280
You actually do have just
an inherent advantage

6970
05:28:17,279 --> 05:28:18,840
'cause you don't need
to go through muscle.

6971
05:28:18,840 --> 05:28:21,150
So the question is, just how
much faster can you make it?

6972
05:28:21,150 --> 05:28:24,450
And we're already than
you what you would do

6973
05:28:24,450 --> 05:28:26,100
if you're going through muscle
from a latency point of view,

6974
05:28:26,099 --> 05:28:27,329
and we're in the early stage of that.

6975
05:28:27,330 --> 05:28:29,130
I think we can push it
sort of our end-to-end

6976
05:28:29,130 --> 05:28:31,770
latency right now from brain
spike to cursor movement,

6977
05:28:31,770 --> 05:28:33,450
it's about 22 milliseconds.

6978
05:28:33,450 --> 05:28:35,487
If you think about the
best mice in the world,

6979
05:28:35,487 --> 05:28:38,460
the best gaming mice, that's
about five milliseconds-ish

6980
05:28:38,459 --> 05:28:40,110
of latency, depending on how you measure.

6981
05:28:40,110 --> 05:28:41,369
Depending how fast your screen refreshes,

6982
05:28:41,369 --> 05:28:42,659
there's a lot of characteristics
that matter there.

6983
05:28:42,659 --> 05:28:45,930
But yeah, and the rough
time for like a neuron

6984
05:28:45,930 --> 05:28:47,250
in the brain to actually impact

6985
05:28:47,250 --> 05:28:50,220
your command of your hand
is about 75 millisecond.

6986
05:28:50,220 --> 05:28:51,510
So if you look at those numbers,

6987
05:28:51,509 --> 05:28:54,509
you can see that we're
already like competitive

6988
05:28:54,509 --> 05:28:56,099
and slightly faster than what you'd get

6989
05:28:56,099 --> 05:28:58,559
by actually moving your hand.

6990
05:28:58,560 --> 05:29:01,050
And this is something that,
if you ask Noland about it,

6991
05:29:01,049 --> 05:29:02,549
when he moved the cursor
for the first time,

6992
05:29:02,549 --> 05:29:03,630
we asked him about this.

6993
05:29:03,630 --> 05:29:04,620
This was something I
was super curious about,

6994
05:29:04,619 --> 05:29:07,079
like what does it feel like
when you're modulating,

6995
05:29:07,080 --> 05:29:08,880
a click intention or when
you're trying to just move

6996
05:29:08,880 --> 05:29:10,229
the cursor to the right.

6997
05:29:10,229 --> 05:29:13,770
He said it moves before he is
like actually intending it to,

6998
05:29:13,770 --> 05:29:17,010
which is kind of a surreal
thing and something that

6999
05:29:17,009 --> 05:29:18,509
I would love to experience myself one day.

7000
05:29:18,509 --> 05:29:20,939
What is that like to have that
thing just be so immediate,

7001
05:29:20,939 --> 05:29:23,009
so fluid that it feels like it's happening

7002
05:29:23,009 --> 05:29:25,319
before you're actually
intending it to move.

7003
05:29:25,319 --> 05:29:27,419
- Yeah, I suppose we've
gotten used to that latency,

7004
05:29:27,419 --> 05:29:29,119
that natural latency that happens.

7005
05:29:30,029 --> 05:29:33,000
So is the currently the
bottleneck, the communication,

7006
05:29:33,000 --> 05:29:34,590
so like the Bluetooth communication,

7007
05:29:34,590 --> 05:29:36,090
what's the actual bottleneck?

7008
05:29:36,090 --> 05:29:37,380
I mean, there's always
gonna be a bottleneck.

7009
05:29:37,380 --> 05:29:38,760
What's the current bottleneck?

7010
05:29:38,759 --> 05:29:39,719
- Yeah, a couple things.

7011
05:29:39,720 --> 05:29:44,190
So kind of hilariously,
Bluetooth low energy protocol

7012
05:29:44,189 --> 05:29:47,639
has some restrictions on how
fast you can communicate.

7013
05:29:47,639 --> 05:29:49,739
So the protocol itself
establishes a standard

7014
05:29:49,740 --> 05:29:52,277
of the most frequent sort
of updates you can send

7015
05:29:52,276 --> 05:29:54,989
are on the order of 7.5 milliseconds.

7016
05:29:54,990 --> 05:29:57,630
And as we push latency down to the level

7017
05:29:57,630 --> 05:30:00,690
of sort of individual
spikes impacting control,

7018
05:30:00,689 --> 05:30:03,209
that level of resolution,
that kind of protocol

7019
05:30:03,209 --> 05:30:05,610
is gonna become a limiting
factor at some scale.

7020
05:30:06,779 --> 05:30:08,902
Another sort of important nuance to this

7021
05:30:08,902 --> 05:30:11,909
is that it's not just the Neuralink itself

7022
05:30:11,909 --> 05:30:12,900
that's part of this equation.

7023
05:30:12,900 --> 05:30:15,569
If you start pushing latency
sort of below the level

7024
05:30:15,569 --> 05:30:18,062
of how fast screens refresh,
then you have another problem.

7025
05:30:18,062 --> 05:30:22,289
Like you need your whole system
to be able to be as reactive

7026
05:30:22,290 --> 05:30:25,229
as the sort of limits of what
the technology can offer.

7027
05:30:25,229 --> 05:30:26,669
Like you need the screen like 120 hertz

7028
05:30:26,669 --> 05:30:28,169
just doesn't work anymore

7029
05:30:28,169 --> 05:30:29,909
if you're trying to have something respond

7030
05:30:29,909 --> 05:30:31,979
at something that's at the
level of one millisecond.

7031
05:30:31,979 --> 05:30:33,750
- That's a really cool challenge.

7032
05:30:33,750 --> 05:30:35,341
I also like that for a T-shirt,

7033
05:30:35,341 --> 05:30:37,619
the best mouse in the world.

7034
05:30:37,619 --> 05:30:40,289
Tell me on the receiving
end, so the decoding step,

7035
05:30:40,290 --> 05:30:42,750
now we figured out what the spikes are,

7036
05:30:42,750 --> 05:30:43,619
we got them all together,

7037
05:30:43,619 --> 05:30:46,922
now we're sending that over to the app.

7038
05:30:47,970 --> 05:30:49,710
What's the decoding step look like?

7039
05:30:49,709 --> 05:30:52,200
- Yeah, so maybe first, what is decoding?

7040
05:30:52,200 --> 05:30:53,520
I think there's probably
a lot of folks listening

7041
05:30:53,520 --> 05:30:55,020
that just have no clue what it means

7042
05:30:55,020 --> 05:30:56,159
to decode brain activity.

7043
05:30:56,159 --> 05:30:58,529
- Actually, even if we
zoom out beyond that,

7044
05:30:58,529 --> 05:30:59,610
what is the app?

7045
05:30:59,610 --> 05:31:04,610
So there's an implant that's
wirelessly communicating

7046
05:31:04,680 --> 05:31:08,729
with any digital device
that has an app installed.

7047
05:31:08,729 --> 05:31:11,073
So maybe can you tell me a
high level what the app is,

7048
05:31:11,073 --> 05:31:14,610
what the software is outside of the brain?

7049
05:31:14,610 --> 05:31:17,250
- Yeah, so maybe working
backwards from the goal,

7050
05:31:17,250 --> 05:31:19,490
the goal is to help
someone with paralysis,

7051
05:31:19,490 --> 05:31:20,940
in this case Noland,

7052
05:31:20,939 --> 05:31:23,250
be able to navigate his
computer independently.

7053
05:31:23,250 --> 05:31:25,169
And we think the best way to do that

7054
05:31:25,169 --> 05:31:27,719
is to offer them the
same tools that we have

7055
05:31:27,720 --> 05:31:29,370
to navigate our software
because we don't wanna have

7056
05:31:29,369 --> 05:31:32,069
to rebuild an entire software
ecosystem for the brain.

7057
05:31:32,069 --> 05:31:33,599
At least not yet.

7058
05:31:33,599 --> 05:31:34,802
Maybe someday you can imagine there's UXs

7059
05:31:34,802 --> 05:31:36,540
that are built natively for BCI.

7060
05:31:36,540 --> 05:31:39,270
But in terms of what's
useful for people today,

7061
05:31:39,270 --> 05:31:41,670
I think most people would prefer
to be able to just control

7062
05:31:41,669 --> 05:31:43,649
mouse and keyboard inputs
to all the applications

7063
05:31:43,650 --> 05:31:45,450
that they wanna use for their daily jobs,

7064
05:31:45,450 --> 05:31:47,790
for communicating with
their friends, et cetera.

7065
05:31:47,790 --> 05:31:49,709
And so the job of the application

7066
05:31:49,709 --> 05:31:51,689
is really to translate
this wireless stream

7067
05:31:51,689 --> 05:31:53,789
of brain data coming off the implant

7068
05:31:53,790 --> 05:31:55,530
into control of the computer.

7069
05:31:55,529 --> 05:31:57,569
And we do that by essentially building

7070
05:31:57,569 --> 05:32:00,720
a mapping from brain activity
to sort of the HID inputs

7071
05:32:00,720 --> 05:32:02,670
to the actual hardware.

7072
05:32:02,669 --> 05:32:03,929
So HID is just the protocol

7073
05:32:03,930 --> 05:32:06,450
for communicating like
input device events.

7074
05:32:06,450 --> 05:32:09,119
So for example, move
mouse to this position

7075
05:32:09,119 --> 05:32:10,919
or press this key down.

7076
05:32:10,919 --> 05:32:12,389
And so that mapping is fundamentally

7077
05:32:12,389 --> 05:32:14,009
what the app is responsible for.

7078
05:32:14,009 --> 05:32:15,809
But there's a lot of nuance
of how that mapping works

7079
05:32:15,810 --> 05:32:17,819
that we spend a lot of
time to try to get right

7080
05:32:17,819 --> 05:32:19,709
and we're still in the early
stages of a long journey

7081
05:32:19,709 --> 05:32:21,809
to figure out how to do that optimally.

7082
05:32:21,810 --> 05:32:23,790
So one part of that process is decoding.

7083
05:32:23,790 --> 05:32:24,990
So decoding is this process

7084
05:32:24,990 --> 05:32:27,600
of taking the statistical
patterns of brain data

7085
05:32:27,599 --> 05:32:29,489
that's being channeled across
this Bluetooth connection

7086
05:32:29,490 --> 05:32:31,740
to the application and turning it into,

7087
05:32:31,740 --> 05:32:33,600
for example, a mouse movement.

7088
05:32:33,599 --> 05:32:34,789
And that decoding step,
you can think of it

7089
05:32:34,790 --> 05:32:36,000
in a couple different parts.

7090
05:32:36,000 --> 05:32:37,979
So similar to any
machine learning problem,

7091
05:32:37,979 --> 05:32:40,259
there's a training step and
there's an inference step.

7092
05:32:40,259 --> 05:32:44,039
The training step in our
case is a very intricate

7093
05:32:44,040 --> 05:32:46,440
behavioral process where the user has

7094
05:32:46,439 --> 05:32:48,329
to imagine doing different actions.

7095
05:32:48,330 --> 05:32:50,430
So for example, they'll
be presented a screen

7096
05:32:50,430 --> 05:32:52,110
with a cursor on it and they'll be asked

7097
05:32:52,110 --> 05:32:54,240
to push that cursor to the right.

7098
05:32:54,240 --> 05:32:56,490
Then imagine pushing that
cursor to the left, push it up,

7099
05:32:56,490 --> 05:32:59,130
push it down, and we can
basically build up a pattern

7100
05:32:59,130 --> 05:33:01,710
or using any sort of modern ML method,

7101
05:33:01,709 --> 05:33:05,009
a mapping of given this brain data

7102
05:33:05,009 --> 05:33:07,529
and that imagined behavior
map one to the other.

7103
05:33:07,529 --> 05:33:08,362
And then at test time,

7104
05:33:08,363 --> 05:33:09,930
you take that same
pattern matching system.

7105
05:33:09,930 --> 05:33:11,490
In our case, it's a deep neural network,

7106
05:33:11,490 --> 05:33:13,290
and you run it and you
take the live stream

7107
05:33:13,290 --> 05:33:15,420
of brain data coming off
their implant, you decode it

7108
05:33:15,419 --> 05:33:18,119
by pattern matching to what
you saw at calibration time,

7109
05:33:18,119 --> 05:33:20,789
and you use that for a
control of the computer.

7110
05:33:20,790 --> 05:33:22,470
Now, a couple like sort of rabbit holes

7111
05:33:22,470 --> 05:33:24,389
that are I think are quite interesting,

7112
05:33:24,389 --> 05:33:26,250
one of them has to do with how you build

7113
05:33:26,250 --> 05:33:28,590
that best template matching system

7114
05:33:28,590 --> 05:33:32,580
because there's a variety
of behavioral challenges

7115
05:33:32,580 --> 05:33:33,750
and also debugging challenges

7116
05:33:33,750 --> 05:33:35,159
when you're working with
someone who's paralyzed.

7117
05:33:35,159 --> 05:33:36,119
Because again, fundamentally,

7118
05:33:36,119 --> 05:33:37,500
you don't observe what
they're trying to do.

7119
05:33:37,500 --> 05:33:39,840
You can't see them attempt
to move their hand.

7120
05:33:39,840 --> 05:33:42,509
And so you have to figure out
a way to instruct the user

7121
05:33:42,509 --> 05:33:45,779
to do something and validate
that they're doing it correctly

7122
05:33:45,779 --> 05:33:49,529
such that then you can
downstream, build with confidence

7123
05:33:49,529 --> 05:33:51,299
the mapping between the neural spikes

7124
05:33:51,299 --> 05:33:53,130
and the intended action.

7125
05:33:53,130 --> 05:33:55,229
And by doing the action correctly,

7126
05:33:55,229 --> 05:33:57,619
what I really mean is at
this level of resolution

7127
05:33:57,619 --> 05:33:59,729
of what neurons are doing.

7128
05:33:59,729 --> 05:34:02,819
So if in ideal world,
you could get a signal

7129
05:34:02,819 --> 05:34:06,060
of behavioral intent that
is ground truth accurate

7130
05:34:06,060 --> 05:34:08,490
at the scale of sort of
one millisecond resolution,

7131
05:34:08,490 --> 05:34:10,680
then with high confidence,
I could build a mapping

7132
05:34:10,680 --> 05:34:13,470
from my neuro spikes to
that behavioral intention.

7133
05:34:13,470 --> 05:34:14,460
But the challenge is, again,

7134
05:34:14,459 --> 05:34:17,099
that you don't observe what
they're actually doing.

7135
05:34:17,099 --> 05:34:18,479
And so there's a lot of nuance

7136
05:34:18,479 --> 05:34:19,739
to how you build user experiences

7137
05:34:19,740 --> 05:34:21,750
that give you more than
just sort of a course

7138
05:34:21,750 --> 05:34:23,340
on average correct representation

7139
05:34:23,340 --> 05:34:24,990
of what the user's intending to do.

7140
05:34:24,990 --> 05:34:26,700
If you want to build
the world's best mouse,

7141
05:34:26,700 --> 05:34:29,729
you really want it to be
as responsive as possible.

7142
05:34:29,729 --> 05:34:30,663
You want it to be able to do exactly

7143
05:34:30,663 --> 05:34:32,610
what the user's intending
at every sort of step

7144
05:34:32,610 --> 05:34:34,740
along the way, not just
on average be correct

7145
05:34:34,740 --> 05:34:36,690
when you're trying to move
it from left to right.

7146
05:34:36,689 --> 05:34:40,319
And building a behavioral
sort of calibration game

7147
05:34:40,319 --> 05:34:42,989
or sort of software experience
that gives you that level

7148
05:34:42,990 --> 05:34:44,237
of resolution is what we
spend a lot of time working.

7149
05:34:44,237 --> 05:34:47,069
- So the calibration process,

7150
05:34:47,069 --> 05:34:51,389
the interface has to encourage precision,

7151
05:34:51,389 --> 05:34:52,889
meaning like whatever it does,

7152
05:34:52,889 --> 05:34:56,579
it should be super intuitive
that the next thing

7153
05:34:56,580 --> 05:35:00,270
the human is going to likely
do is exactly that intention

7154
05:35:00,270 --> 05:35:03,086
that you need and only that intention.

7155
05:35:03,086 --> 05:35:05,939
And you don't have any feedback

7156
05:35:05,939 --> 05:35:09,149
except that may be
speaking to you afterwards

7157
05:35:09,150 --> 05:35:10,260
what they actually did.

7158
05:35:10,259 --> 05:35:11,789
You can't, "Oh yeah."
- Right.

7159
05:35:11,790 --> 05:35:14,850
- So that's fundamentally,

7160
05:35:14,849 --> 05:35:17,236
that is a really exciting UX challenge,

7161
05:35:17,237 --> 05:35:19,032
'cause that's all on the UX.

7162
05:35:19,032 --> 05:35:23,099
It's not just about being
friendly or nice or usable.

7163
05:35:23,099 --> 05:35:24,119
- Yeah.
- It's like-

7164
05:35:24,119 --> 05:35:25,500
- User experience is how it works.

7165
05:35:25,500 --> 05:35:26,880
- It's how it works.
- Yeah.

7166
05:35:26,880 --> 05:35:28,170
- For the calibration,

7167
05:35:28,169 --> 05:35:30,769
and calibration, at least
at this stage of Neuralink,

7168
05:35:30,770 --> 05:35:35,580
is like fundamental to
the operation of the thing

7169
05:35:35,580 --> 05:35:36,870
and not just calibration

7170
05:35:36,869 --> 05:35:39,473
but continued calibration essentially.

7171
05:35:39,473 --> 05:35:40,306
- [Bliss] Yeah.

7172
05:35:40,307 --> 05:35:41,526
- Wow, yeah.
- You said something

7173
05:35:41,526 --> 05:35:43,290
that I think is worth
exploring there a little bit.

7174
05:35:43,290 --> 05:35:44,967
You said it's primarily a UX challenge,

7175
05:35:44,967 --> 05:35:46,889
and I think a large component of it is,

7176
05:35:46,889 --> 05:35:49,439
but there is also a very interesting

7177
05:35:49,439 --> 05:35:50,369
machine learning challenge here,

7178
05:35:50,369 --> 05:35:53,939
which is given some data set,

7179
05:35:53,939 --> 05:35:56,909
including some on average correct behavior

7180
05:35:56,909 --> 05:35:59,220
of asking the user to
move up or move down,

7181
05:35:59,220 --> 05:36:00,750
move right, move left,

7182
05:36:00,750 --> 05:36:02,250
and given a data set of neural spikes,

7183
05:36:02,250 --> 05:36:05,310
is there a way to infer in
some kind of semi-supervised

7184
05:36:05,310 --> 05:36:06,900
or entirely unsupervised way

7185
05:36:06,900 --> 05:36:10,290
what that high resolution
version of their intention is?

7186
05:36:10,290 --> 05:36:12,510
And if you think about
it, like there probably is

7187
05:36:12,509 --> 05:36:15,119
because there are enough
data points in the dataset,

7188
05:36:15,119 --> 05:36:17,759
enough constraints on your
model that there should be a way

7189
05:36:17,759 --> 05:36:19,709
with the right sort of formulation

7190
05:36:19,709 --> 05:36:21,000
to let the model figure out itself.

7191
05:36:21,000 --> 05:36:22,169
For example, at this millisecond,

7192
05:36:22,169 --> 05:36:24,980
this is exactly how hard
they're pushing upwards.

7193
05:36:24,980 --> 05:36:26,250
And at this millisecond, this is how hard

7194
05:36:26,250 --> 05:36:27,419
they're trying to push upwards.

7195
05:36:27,419 --> 05:36:30,479
- It's really important to
have very clean labels, yes.

7196
05:36:30,479 --> 05:36:32,310
So like the problem becomes much harder

7197
05:36:32,310 --> 05:36:33,540
from the machine learning perspective

7198
05:36:33,540 --> 05:36:35,580
if the labels are noisy.

7199
05:36:35,580 --> 05:36:36,413
- [Bliss] That's correct.

7200
05:36:36,413 --> 05:36:40,590
- And then to get the clean
labels, that's a UX challenge.

7201
05:36:40,590 --> 05:36:42,360
- Correct, although clean labels,

7202
05:36:42,360 --> 05:36:45,029
I think maybe it's worth
exploring what that exactly means.

7203
05:36:45,029 --> 05:36:47,189
I think any given labeling strategy

7204
05:36:47,189 --> 05:36:48,750
will have some number
of assumptions it makes

7205
05:36:48,750 --> 05:36:50,580
about what the user's attempting to do.

7206
05:36:50,580 --> 05:36:53,310
Those assumptions can be
formulated in a loss function,

7207
05:36:53,310 --> 05:36:55,020
or they can be formulated
in terms of heuristics

7208
05:36:55,020 --> 05:36:56,490
that you might use to just try to estimate

7209
05:36:56,490 --> 05:36:58,710
or guesstimate what the
user's trying to do.

7210
05:36:58,709 --> 05:36:59,549
And what really matters

7211
05:36:59,549 --> 05:37:01,319
is how accurate are those assumptions.

7212
05:37:01,319 --> 05:37:03,096
For example, you might say,

7213
05:37:03,097 --> 05:37:04,590
"Hey, user, push upwards

7214
05:37:04,590 --> 05:37:06,990
and follow the speed of this cursor,"

7215
05:37:06,990 --> 05:37:09,210
and your heuristic might be
that they're trying to do it

7216
05:37:09,209 --> 05:37:10,770
exactly what that cursor's trying to do.

7217
05:37:10,770 --> 05:37:12,389
Another competing heuristic might be

7218
05:37:12,389 --> 05:37:13,860
they're actually trying
to go slightly faster

7219
05:37:13,860 --> 05:37:14,700
at the beginning of the movement

7220
05:37:14,700 --> 05:37:16,380
and slightly slower at the end.

7221
05:37:16,380 --> 05:37:18,510
And those competing heuristics
may or may not be accurate

7222
05:37:18,509 --> 05:37:20,639
reflections of what the
user's trying to do.

7223
05:37:20,639 --> 05:37:21,967
Another version of the task might be,

7224
05:37:21,967 --> 05:37:25,560
"Hey, user, imagine moving
this cursor a fixed offset.

7225
05:37:25,560 --> 05:37:27,030
So rather than follow the cursor,

7226
05:37:27,029 --> 05:37:29,579
just try to move it exactly
200 pixels to the right."

7227
05:37:29,580 --> 05:37:31,500
So here's the cursor, here's the target.

7228
05:37:31,500 --> 05:37:32,610
Okay, cursor disappears.

7229
05:37:32,610 --> 05:37:34,590
Try to move that now invisible cursor

7230
05:37:34,590 --> 05:37:36,180
200 pixels to the right.

7231
05:37:36,180 --> 05:37:37,830
And the assumption in that
case would be that the user

7232
05:37:37,830 --> 05:37:41,220
can actually modulate
correctly that position offset,

7233
05:37:41,220 --> 05:37:42,690
but that position offset assumption

7234
05:37:42,689 --> 05:37:45,419
might be a weaker
assumption, and therefore,

7235
05:37:45,419 --> 05:37:47,159
potentially you can make it more accurate

7236
05:37:47,159 --> 05:37:48,750
than these heuristics that
are trying to guesstimate

7237
05:37:48,750 --> 05:37:50,970
at each millisecond what
the user's trying to do.

7238
05:37:50,970 --> 05:37:52,680
So you can imagine different tasks

7239
05:37:52,680 --> 05:37:55,260
that make different
assumptions about the nature

7240
05:37:55,259 --> 05:37:58,169
of the user intention and
those assumptions being correct

7241
05:37:58,169 --> 05:37:59,943
is what I would think of as a clean label.

7242
05:37:59,943 --> 05:38:02,790
- For that step, what are we
supposed to be visualizing?

7243
05:38:02,790 --> 05:38:05,340
There's a cursor and you
wanna move that cursor

7244
05:38:05,340 --> 05:38:06,840
to the right or the left or up and down

7245
05:38:06,840 --> 05:38:09,422
or maybe move them by a certain offset.

7246
05:38:10,500 --> 05:38:13,229
So that's one way, is that the
best way to do calibration?

7247
05:38:13,229 --> 05:38:15,479
So for example, an alternative crazy way

7248
05:38:15,479 --> 05:38:17,253
that probably is playing a role here

7249
05:38:17,253 --> 05:38:19,740
is a game like Webgrid,

7250
05:38:19,740 --> 05:38:23,880
where you're just getting a
very large amount of data,

7251
05:38:23,880 --> 05:38:25,920
the person playing a game,

7252
05:38:25,919 --> 05:38:28,589
where if they're in a state of flow,

7253
05:38:28,590 --> 05:38:33,590
maybe you can get clean
signal as a side effect.

7254
05:38:33,659 --> 05:38:34,492
- [Bliss] Yep.

7255
05:38:36,002 --> 05:38:38,520
- Is that not an effective
way for initial calibration?

7256
05:38:38,520 --> 05:38:39,352
- Yeah, great question.

7257
05:38:39,352 --> 05:38:40,409
There's a lot to unpack there.

7258
05:38:40,409 --> 05:38:43,709
So the first thing I
would draw a distinction

7259
05:38:43,709 --> 05:38:46,139
between a sort of open
loop, first closed loop.

7260
05:38:46,139 --> 05:38:47,399
So open loop, what I mean by that

7261
05:38:47,400 --> 05:38:49,740
is the user is sort of
going from zero to one.

7262
05:38:49,740 --> 05:38:51,120
They have no model at all,

7263
05:38:51,119 --> 05:38:52,319
and they're trying to get to the place

7264
05:38:52,319 --> 05:38:55,020
where they have some
level of control at all.

7265
05:38:55,020 --> 05:38:58,020
In that setup, you really
need to have some task

7266
05:38:58,020 --> 05:38:59,790
that gives the user a hint
of what you want them to do

7267
05:38:59,790 --> 05:39:01,170
such that you can build this mapping again

7268
05:39:01,169 --> 05:39:03,959
from brain data to output.

7269
05:39:03,959 --> 05:39:06,329
Then once they have a model,
you could imagine them

7270
05:39:06,330 --> 05:39:08,880
using that model and
actually adapting to it

7271
05:39:08,880 --> 05:39:10,979
and figuring out the right
way to use it themself

7272
05:39:10,979 --> 05:39:12,329
and then retraining on that data

7273
05:39:12,330 --> 05:39:14,640
to give you sort of a
boost in performance.

7274
05:39:14,639 --> 05:39:15,959
There's a lot of challenges associated

7275
05:39:15,959 --> 05:39:17,909
with both of these techniques
and we can sort of rabbit hole

7276
05:39:17,909 --> 05:39:19,154
into both of 'em, if you're interested.

7277
05:39:19,154 --> 05:39:21,869
But the sort of challenge
with the open loop task

7278
05:39:21,869 --> 05:39:24,180
is that the user themself doesn't get

7279
05:39:24,180 --> 05:39:26,580
proprioceptive feedback
about what they're doing.

7280
05:39:26,580 --> 05:39:29,460
They don't necessarily perceive themself

7281
05:39:29,459 --> 05:39:31,739
or feel the mouse under their hand

7282
05:39:31,740 --> 05:39:33,090
when they're using an open,

7283
05:39:33,090 --> 05:39:34,619
when they're trying to do
an open loop calibration.

7284
05:39:34,619 --> 05:39:36,059
They're being asked to perform something.

7285
05:39:36,060 --> 05:39:39,420
Like imagine if you sort of
had your whole right arm numbed

7286
05:39:39,419 --> 05:39:40,992
and you stuck it in a box
and you couldn't see it.

7287
05:39:40,992 --> 05:39:42,899
So you had no visual feedback

7288
05:39:42,900 --> 05:39:44,400
and you had no proprioceptive feedback

7289
05:39:44,400 --> 05:39:47,040
about what the position or
activity of your arm was.

7290
05:39:47,040 --> 05:39:48,900
And now you're asked, okay,
given this thing on the screen

7291
05:39:48,900 --> 05:39:51,990
that's moving from left to
right, match that speed.

7292
05:39:51,990 --> 05:39:55,740
And you basically can
try your best to invoke

7293
05:39:55,740 --> 05:39:57,930
whatever that imagined
action is in your brain

7294
05:39:57,930 --> 05:39:59,819
that's moving the cursor
from left to right.

7295
05:39:59,819 --> 05:40:02,489
But in any situation,
you're gonna be inaccurate

7296
05:40:02,490 --> 05:40:04,677
and maybe inconsistent
in how you do that task.

7297
05:40:04,676 --> 05:40:05,939
And so that's sort of the fundamental

7298
05:40:05,939 --> 05:40:07,319
challenge of open loop.

7299
05:40:07,319 --> 05:40:09,270
The challenge with closed loop is that,

7300
05:40:09,270 --> 05:40:11,282
once the user's given a model,

7301
05:40:12,450 --> 05:40:15,510
and they're able to start
moving the mouse on their own,

7302
05:40:15,509 --> 05:40:18,329
they're going to very
naturally adapt to that model.

7303
05:40:18,330 --> 05:40:20,730
And that co-adaptation
between the model learning,

7304
05:40:20,729 --> 05:40:22,470
what they're doing, and the user learning

7305
05:40:22,470 --> 05:40:24,870
how to use the model may
not find you the best

7306
05:40:24,869 --> 05:40:25,770
sort of global minima.

7307
05:40:25,770 --> 05:40:28,920
And maybe that your first
model was noisy in some ways

7308
05:40:28,919 --> 05:40:31,851
or maybe just had some like quirk,

7309
05:40:31,851 --> 05:40:33,479
like if there's some like
part of the data distribution

7310
05:40:33,479 --> 05:40:36,509
that didn't cover super well,
and the user now figures out

7311
05:40:36,509 --> 05:40:38,519
because they're a
brilliant user like Noland.

7312
05:40:38,520 --> 05:40:41,310
They figured out the right
sequence of imagined motions

7313
05:40:41,310 --> 05:40:42,720
or the right angle they
have to hold their hand at

7314
05:40:42,720 --> 05:40:43,898
to get it to work.

7315
05:40:43,898 --> 05:40:45,060
And they'll get it to work great,

7316
05:40:45,060 --> 05:40:46,979
but then the next day, they
come back to their device

7317
05:40:46,979 --> 05:40:48,149
and maybe they don't remember exactly

7318
05:40:48,150 --> 05:40:49,307
all the tricks that they
used the previous day.

7319
05:40:49,307 --> 05:40:51,930
And so there's a complicated
sort of feedback cycle here

7320
05:40:51,930 --> 05:40:54,052
that can emerge and can make it

7321
05:40:54,052 --> 05:40:56,549
a very, very difficult debugging process.

7322
05:40:56,549 --> 05:41:00,000
- Okay, there's a lot of really
fascinating things there.

7323
05:41:00,000 --> 05:41:03,422
Yeah, actually, just to
stay on the closed loop,

7324
05:41:07,259 --> 05:41:09,779
I've seen situations,
this actually happened

7325
05:41:09,779 --> 05:41:12,869
watching psychology grad students.

7326
05:41:12,869 --> 05:41:14,489
They use piece of software
when they don't know

7327
05:41:14,490 --> 05:41:15,420
how to program themselves.

7328
05:41:15,419 --> 05:41:17,549
They use piece of software
that somebody else wrote,

7329
05:41:17,549 --> 05:41:18,899
and it has a bunch of bugs.

7330
05:41:19,830 --> 05:41:21,060
And they figure out like,

7331
05:41:21,060 --> 05:41:22,830
and they've been using it for years.

7332
05:41:22,830 --> 05:41:24,627
They figured out ways to work around it.

7333
05:41:24,627 --> 05:41:25,860
Oh, that just happens.

7334
05:41:25,860 --> 05:41:29,430
Like nobody like considers
maybe we should fix this.

7335
05:41:29,430 --> 05:41:30,630
They just adapt.

7336
05:41:30,630 --> 05:41:33,090
And that's a really interesting notion,

7337
05:41:33,090 --> 05:41:37,770
that we were really good at
adapting, but you need to still,

7338
05:41:37,770 --> 05:41:39,779
that might not be the optimal.

7339
05:41:39,779 --> 05:41:41,279
Okay, so how do you solve that problem?

7340
05:41:41,279 --> 05:41:43,349
Do you have to restart from scratch

7341
05:41:43,349 --> 05:41:44,879
every once in a while kind of thing?

7342
05:41:44,880 --> 05:41:46,409
- Yeah, it's a good question.

7343
05:41:46,409 --> 05:41:47,340
First and foremost, I would say

7344
05:41:47,340 --> 05:41:48,599
this is not a solved problem.

7345
05:41:48,599 --> 05:41:51,539
And for anyone who's listening in academia

7346
05:41:51,540 --> 05:41:54,150
who works on BCIs, I would
also say this is not a problem

7347
05:41:54,150 --> 05:41:57,060
that's solved by simply
scaling channel account.

7348
05:41:57,060 --> 05:41:58,229
Maybe that can help and you can get

7349
05:41:58,229 --> 05:41:59,579
sort of richer covariance structures

7350
05:41:59,580 --> 05:42:00,990
that you can use to exploit

7351
05:42:00,990 --> 05:42:02,760
when trying to come up with
good labeling strategies.

7352
05:42:02,759 --> 05:42:04,649
But if you're interested in problems,

7353
05:42:04,650 --> 05:42:05,909
that aren't gonna be solved inherently

7354
05:42:05,909 --> 05:42:08,189
by scaling channel account,
this is one of them.

7355
05:42:08,189 --> 05:42:09,629
Yeah, so how do you solve it?

7356
05:42:09,630 --> 05:42:10,650
It's not a solved problem.

7357
05:42:10,650 --> 05:42:12,840
That's the first thing I
wanna make sure gets across.

7358
05:42:12,840 --> 05:42:15,790
The second thing is, any solution
that involves closed loop

7359
05:42:16,830 --> 05:42:18,810
is going to become a very
difficult debugging problem.

7360
05:42:18,810 --> 05:42:21,900
And one of my sort of general
heuristics for choosing

7361
05:42:21,900 --> 05:42:23,610
what prompts to tackle is
that you wanna choose the one

7362
05:42:23,610 --> 05:42:25,470
that's gonna be the easiest to debug,

7363
05:42:25,470 --> 05:42:27,479
'cause if you can do that,

7364
05:42:27,479 --> 05:42:30,689
even if the ceiling is
lower, you're gonna be able

7365
05:42:30,689 --> 05:42:32,579
to move faster because you have a tighter

7366
05:42:32,580 --> 05:42:34,457
iteration loop debugging the problem.

7367
05:42:34,456 --> 05:42:35,609
And in the open loop setting,

7368
05:42:35,610 --> 05:42:37,560
there's not a feedback cycle debug

7369
05:42:37,560 --> 05:42:38,426
with the user in the loop.

7370
05:42:38,426 --> 05:42:39,840
And so there's some reason to think

7371
05:42:39,840 --> 05:42:43,409
that that should be an
easier debugging problem.

7372
05:42:43,409 --> 05:42:44,970
The other thing that's worth understanding

7373
05:42:44,970 --> 05:42:46,680
is that even in a closed loop setting,

7374
05:42:46,680 --> 05:42:48,900
there's no special software
magic of how to infer

7375
05:42:48,900 --> 05:42:50,909
what the user is truly attempting to do.

7376
05:42:50,909 --> 05:42:52,560
In the closed loop setting,
although they're moving

7377
05:42:52,560 --> 05:42:54,960
the cursor on the screen, they
may be attempting something

7378
05:42:54,959 --> 05:42:56,790
different than what your
model is outputting.

7379
05:42:56,790 --> 05:42:58,650
So what the model is
outputting is not a signal

7380
05:42:58,650 --> 05:43:00,330
that you can use to retrain
if you want to be able

7381
05:43:00,330 --> 05:43:01,590
to improve the model further.

7382
05:43:01,590 --> 05:43:04,409
You still have this very
complicated guesstimation

7383
05:43:04,409 --> 05:43:06,689
or unsupervised problem of figuring out

7384
05:43:06,689 --> 05:43:09,689
what is the true user intention
underlying that signal.

7385
05:43:09,689 --> 05:43:11,759
And so the open loop problem
has the nice property

7386
05:43:11,759 --> 05:43:13,709
of being easy to debug.

7387
05:43:13,709 --> 05:43:15,419
And the second nice property of,

7388
05:43:15,419 --> 05:43:17,369
it has all the same
information and content

7389
05:43:17,369 --> 05:43:18,770
as the closed loop scenario.

7390
05:43:19,830 --> 05:43:21,203
Another thing I wanna mention and call out

7391
05:43:21,203 --> 05:43:23,340
is that this problem
doesn't need to be solved

7392
05:43:23,340 --> 05:43:26,159
in order to give useful control to people.

7393
05:43:26,159 --> 05:43:28,439
Even today with the solutions we have now

7394
05:43:28,439 --> 05:43:30,689
and that academia has
built up over decades,

7395
05:43:30,689 --> 05:43:32,609
the level of control that can be given

7396
05:43:32,610 --> 05:43:35,580
to a user today is quite useful.

7397
05:43:35,580 --> 05:43:36,737
It doesn't need to be solved

7398
05:43:36,737 --> 05:43:38,310
to get to that level of control.

7399
05:43:38,310 --> 05:43:40,170
But again, I wanna build
the world's best mouse.

7400
05:43:40,169 --> 05:43:42,059
I wanna make it so good

7401
05:43:42,060 --> 05:43:44,159
that it's not even a
question that you want it.

7402
05:43:44,159 --> 05:43:48,240
And to build the world's best
mouse, the superhuman version,

7403
05:43:48,240 --> 05:43:51,177
you really need to nail that problem.

7404
05:43:51,176 --> 05:43:54,270
And a couple maybe details
of previous studies

7405
05:43:54,270 --> 05:43:56,220
that we've done internally that
I think are very interesting

7406
05:43:56,220 --> 05:43:58,470
to understand when thinking
about how to solve this problem,

7407
05:43:58,470 --> 05:44:00,953
the first is that even when
you have ground truth data

7408
05:44:00,953 --> 05:44:02,397
of what the user's trying to do,

7409
05:44:02,397 --> 05:44:04,380
and you can get this with
an able-bodied monkey,

7410
05:44:04,380 --> 05:44:06,600
a monkey that has a
Neuralink device implanted

7411
05:44:06,599 --> 05:44:08,430
and moving a mouse to control a computer,

7412
05:44:08,430 --> 05:44:11,069
even with that ground truth dataset,

7413
05:44:11,069 --> 05:44:13,829
it turns out that the
optimal thing to predict

7414
05:44:13,830 --> 05:44:16,230
to produce high performance BCI

7415
05:44:16,229 --> 05:44:18,689
is not just the direct
control of the mouse.

7416
05:44:18,689 --> 05:44:20,189
You can imagine building dataset

7417
05:44:20,189 --> 05:44:21,266
of what's going on in the brain

7418
05:44:21,266 --> 05:44:24,090
and what is the mouse
exactly doing on the table.

7419
05:44:24,090 --> 05:44:25,680
And it turns out that
if you build the mapping

7420
05:44:25,680 --> 05:44:27,330
from neuro spikes to predict exactly

7421
05:44:27,330 --> 05:44:29,700
what the mouse is doing,
that model will perform

7422
05:44:29,700 --> 05:44:32,220
worse than a model that
is trained to predict

7423
05:44:32,220 --> 05:44:33,360
sort of higher level assumptions

7424
05:44:33,360 --> 05:44:35,130
about what the user might be trying to do.

7425
05:44:35,130 --> 05:44:36,840
For example, assuming
that the monkey is trying

7426
05:44:36,840 --> 05:44:38,459
to go in a straight line to the target,

7427
05:44:38,459 --> 05:44:40,379
it turns out that making those assumptions

7428
05:44:40,380 --> 05:44:42,299
is actually more effective

7429
05:44:42,299 --> 05:44:44,250
in producing a model
than actually predicting

7430
05:44:44,250 --> 05:44:45,082
the underlying hand movement.

7431
05:44:45,082 --> 05:44:46,169
- So the intention,

7432
05:44:46,169 --> 05:44:48,119
not like the physical
movement or whatever.

7433
05:44:48,119 --> 05:44:49,739
- Yeah.
- There's obviously

7434
05:44:49,740 --> 05:44:51,330
a really strong correlation
between the two,

7435
05:44:51,330 --> 05:44:54,570
but the intention is a more
powerful thing to be chasing.

7436
05:44:54,569 --> 05:44:55,739
- [Bliss] Right.

7437
05:44:55,740 --> 05:44:57,630
- Well, that's also super interesting.

7438
05:44:57,630 --> 05:45:01,680
I mean, the intention
itself is fascinating,

7439
05:45:01,680 --> 05:45:03,479
because yes, with the BCI here,

7440
05:45:03,479 --> 05:45:06,060
in this case, with a digital telepathy,

7441
05:45:06,060 --> 05:45:08,909
you're acting on the
intention, not the action,

7442
05:45:08,909 --> 05:45:10,709
which is why there's an experience

7443
05:45:10,709 --> 05:45:13,259
of like feeling like it's happening

7444
05:45:13,259 --> 05:45:15,509
before you meant for it to happen.

7445
05:45:15,509 --> 05:45:17,159
That is so cool.

7446
05:45:17,159 --> 05:45:18,540
And that is why you could achieve

7447
05:45:18,540 --> 05:45:20,520
like superhuman performance problem

7448
05:45:20,520 --> 05:45:22,400
in terms of the control of the mouse.

7449
05:45:22,400 --> 05:45:24,540
So for open loop, just to clarify,

7450
05:45:24,540 --> 05:45:27,870
so whenever the person is tasked

7451
05:45:27,869 --> 05:45:29,789
to like move the mouse to the right,

7452
05:45:29,790 --> 05:45:31,139
you said there's not feedback

7453
05:45:31,139 --> 05:45:35,279
so they don't get to get that satisfaction

7454
05:45:35,279 --> 05:45:38,819
of like actually getting
it to move, right?

7455
05:45:38,819 --> 05:45:41,520
- You could imagine giving
the user feedback on a screen,

7456
05:45:41,520 --> 05:45:43,260
but it's difficult, because at this point,

7457
05:45:43,259 --> 05:45:44,939
you don't know what
they're attempting to do.

7458
05:45:44,939 --> 05:45:47,250
So what can you show them
that would basically give them

7459
05:45:47,250 --> 05:45:49,619
a signal of I'm doing this
correctly or not correctly.

7460
05:45:49,619 --> 05:45:51,059
So let's take this very specific example.

7461
05:45:51,060 --> 05:45:53,550
Like maybe your calibration
task looks like you're trying

7462
05:45:53,549 --> 05:45:55,770
to move the cursor a
certain position offset.

7463
05:45:55,770 --> 05:45:57,187
So your instructions to the user are,

7464
05:45:57,187 --> 05:45:59,100
"Hey, the cursor's here.

7465
05:45:59,099 --> 05:46:00,539
Now, when the cursor disappears,

7466
05:46:00,540 --> 05:46:02,850
imagine moving it 200
pixels from where it was

7467
05:46:02,849 --> 05:46:05,069
to the right to be over this target."

7468
05:46:05,069 --> 05:46:07,200
In that kind of scenario,
you could imagine coming up

7469
05:46:07,200 --> 05:46:09,150
with some sort of consistency
metric that you could display

7470
05:46:09,150 --> 05:46:11,760
to the user of, "Okay, I
know what the spike train

7471
05:46:11,759 --> 05:46:14,729
looks like on average when you
do this action to the right.

7472
05:46:14,729 --> 05:46:17,069
Maybe I can produce some sort
of probabilistic estimate

7473
05:46:17,069 --> 05:46:20,159
of how likely is that to
be the action you took

7474
05:46:20,159 --> 05:46:23,340
given the latest trial or
trajectory that you imagined."

7475
05:46:23,340 --> 05:46:24,930
And that could give the
user some sort of feedback

7476
05:46:24,930 --> 05:46:27,959
of how consistent are they
across different trials.

7477
05:46:27,959 --> 05:46:31,290
You could also imagine that
if the user is prompted

7478
05:46:31,290 --> 05:46:33,299
with that kind of consistency metric,

7479
05:46:33,299 --> 05:46:34,200
that maybe they just become

7480
05:46:34,200 --> 05:46:35,580
more behaviorally engaged to begin with

7481
05:46:35,580 --> 05:46:37,080
because the task is kind of boring

7482
05:46:37,080 --> 05:46:38,580
when you don't have any feedback at all.

7483
05:46:38,580 --> 05:46:41,760
And so there may be benefits
to the user experience

7484
05:46:41,759 --> 05:46:42,899
of showing something on the screen,

7485
05:46:42,900 --> 05:46:44,730
even if it's not accurate,
just because it keeps

7486
05:46:44,729 --> 05:46:46,649
the user motivated to try to increase

7487
05:46:46,650 --> 05:46:48,090
that number or push it upwards.

7488
05:46:48,090 --> 05:46:50,549
- So there's a psychology element here.

7489
05:46:50,549 --> 05:46:52,290
- Yeah, absolutely.

7490
05:46:52,290 --> 05:46:55,020
- And again, all of that is UX challenge.

7491
05:46:55,020 --> 05:46:59,549
How much signal drift is there,
hour to hour, day to day,

7492
05:46:59,549 --> 05:47:01,709
week to week, month to month?

7493
05:47:01,709 --> 05:47:04,979
How often do you have to recalibrate

7494
05:47:04,979 --> 05:47:06,509
because of the signal drift?

7495
05:47:06,509 --> 05:47:10,379
- Yeah, so this is a
problem we've worked on,

7496
05:47:10,380 --> 05:47:13,889
both with NHP, non-human primates,
before our clinical trial

7497
05:47:13,889 --> 05:47:16,619
and then also with Noland
during the clinical trial.

7498
05:47:16,619 --> 05:47:18,299
Maybe the first thing that's worth stating

7499
05:47:18,299 --> 05:47:19,139
is what the goal is here.

7500
05:47:19,139 --> 05:47:20,669
So the goal is really to enable the user

7501
05:47:20,669 --> 05:47:22,259
to have a plug and play experience

7502
05:47:22,259 --> 05:47:24,000
where I guess they don't
have to plug anything in,

7503
05:47:24,000 --> 05:47:26,849
but a play experience where they can use

7504
05:47:26,849 --> 05:47:29,802
the device whenever they want
to, however they want to.

7505
05:47:29,802 --> 05:47:31,167
And that's really what we're aiming for.

7506
05:47:31,167 --> 05:47:33,180
And so there can be a set of solutions

7507
05:47:33,180 --> 05:47:36,630
that get to that state without considering

7508
05:47:36,630 --> 05:47:38,040
this non-stationary problem.

7509
05:47:38,040 --> 05:47:40,080
So maybe the first solution
here that's important

7510
05:47:40,080 --> 05:47:42,300
is that they can recalibrate
whenever they want.

7511
05:47:42,299 --> 05:47:46,380
This is something that Noland
has the ability to do today.

7512
05:47:46,380 --> 05:47:47,700
So he can recalibrate the system

7513
05:47:47,700 --> 05:47:49,260
at 2:00 AM in the middle of the night,

7514
05:47:49,259 --> 05:47:51,750
without his caretaker or
parents or friends around

7515
05:47:51,750 --> 05:47:53,549
to help push a button for him.

7516
05:47:53,549 --> 05:47:55,500
The other important part
of the solution is that

7517
05:47:55,500 --> 05:47:57,000
when you have a good model calibrated,

7518
05:47:57,000 --> 05:47:58,200
that you can continue using that

7519
05:47:58,200 --> 05:48:00,180
without needing to recalibrate it.

7520
05:48:00,180 --> 05:48:02,220
So how often he has to do
this recalibration today

7521
05:48:02,220 --> 05:48:04,569
depends really on his
appetite for performance.

7522
05:48:06,209 --> 05:48:08,759
We observe sort of a
degradation through time

7523
05:48:08,759 --> 05:48:10,949
of how well any individual model works,

7524
05:48:10,950 --> 05:48:12,450
but this can be mitigated behaviorally

7525
05:48:12,450 --> 05:48:14,670
by the user adapting
their control strategy.

7526
05:48:14,669 --> 05:48:16,349
It can also be mitigated
through a combination

7527
05:48:16,349 --> 05:48:19,019
of sort of software features
that we provide to the user.

7528
05:48:19,020 --> 05:48:21,360
For example, we let
the user adjust exactly

7529
05:48:21,360 --> 05:48:23,220
how fast the cursor is moving.

7530
05:48:23,220 --> 05:48:24,659
We call that the gain, for example,

7531
05:48:24,659 --> 05:48:26,250
the gain of how fast the cursor reacts

7532
05:48:26,250 --> 05:48:27,810
to any given input intention.

7533
05:48:27,810 --> 05:48:29,100
They can also adjust the smoothing,

7534
05:48:29,099 --> 05:48:32,582
how smooth the output of that
cursor intention actually is.

7535
05:48:32,582 --> 05:48:33,989
They can also adjust the friction,

7536
05:48:33,990 --> 05:48:36,300
which is how easy is it
to stop and hold still.

7537
05:48:36,299 --> 05:48:39,029
And all these software tools
allow the user a great deal

7538
05:48:39,029 --> 05:48:40,919
of flexibility and
troubleshooting mechanisms

7539
05:48:40,919 --> 05:48:41,819
to be able to solve this problem

7540
05:48:41,819 --> 05:48:42,652
for themselves.
- By the way,

7541
05:48:42,652 --> 05:48:44,429
all of this is done by looking

7542
05:48:44,430 --> 05:48:45,959
to the right side of the screen,

7543
05:48:45,959 --> 05:48:48,509
selecting the mixer,
and the mixer you have-

7544
05:48:48,509 --> 05:48:50,459
- It's like DJ mode.

7545
05:48:50,459 --> 05:48:51,930
DJ mode for your VCI.

7546
05:48:51,930 --> 05:48:54,389
- So I mean, it's a really
well done interface.

7547
05:48:54,389 --> 05:48:55,860
It's really, really well done.

7548
05:48:55,860 --> 05:49:00,479
And so yeah, there's that bias
that there's a cursor drift

7549
05:49:00,479 --> 05:49:02,492
that Noland talked about in a stream,

7550
05:49:03,389 --> 05:49:06,389
although he said that you
guys were just playing around

7551
05:49:06,389 --> 05:49:08,639
with it with him and then
constantly improving.

7552
05:49:08,639 --> 05:49:10,559
So that could have been just a snapshot

7553
05:49:10,560 --> 05:49:12,987
of that particular
moment, a particular day.

7554
05:49:12,987 --> 05:49:17,987
But he said that there
was this cursor drift

7555
05:49:18,000 --> 05:49:20,880
and this bias that
could be removed by him,

7556
05:49:20,880 --> 05:49:22,257
I guess looking to the
right side of the screen,

7557
05:49:22,257 --> 05:49:24,640
the left side of the screen
to kind of adjust the bias.

7558
05:49:24,639 --> 05:49:26,759
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's one interface

7559
05:49:26,759 --> 05:49:28,590
action I guess to adjust the bias.

7560
05:49:28,590 --> 05:49:30,630
- Yeah, so this is actually an idea

7561
05:49:30,630 --> 05:49:31,979
that comes out of academia.

7562
05:49:32,939 --> 05:49:36,209
There are some prior work
with sort of BrainGate

7563
05:49:36,209 --> 05:49:37,889
clinical trial participants
where they pioneered

7564
05:49:37,889 --> 05:49:39,450
this idea of bias correction.

7565
05:49:39,450 --> 05:49:40,470
The way we've done it I think is,

7566
05:49:40,470 --> 05:49:42,030
yeah, it's very prototized,

7567
05:49:42,029 --> 05:49:44,579
very beautiful user experience

7568
05:49:44,580 --> 05:49:46,800
where the user can essentially

7569
05:49:46,799 --> 05:49:48,419
flash the cursor over to
the side of the screen

7570
05:49:48,419 --> 05:49:50,819
and it opens up a window
where they can actually

7571
05:49:51,659 --> 05:49:54,779
sort of adjust or tune exactly
the bias of the cursor.

7572
05:49:54,779 --> 05:49:56,369
So bias maybe, for people
who aren't familiar,

7573
05:49:56,369 --> 05:49:58,139
is just sort of what is the default motion

7574
05:49:58,139 --> 05:50:00,059
of the cursor if you're imagining nothing.

7575
05:50:00,060 --> 05:50:03,720
And it turns out that
that's one of the first

7576
05:50:03,720 --> 05:50:05,760
sort of qualia of the
cursor control experience

7577
05:50:05,759 --> 05:50:07,500
that's impacted by neuro non-stationarity.

7578
05:50:07,500 --> 05:50:09,000
- Quality off the cursor experience.

7579
05:50:09,000 --> 05:50:10,650
- I don't know how else to describe it.

7580
05:50:10,650 --> 05:50:12,360
I'm not the guy moving-

7581
05:50:12,360 --> 05:50:13,830
- It's very poetic, I love it.

7582
05:50:13,830 --> 05:50:15,570
The quality of the cursor experience.

7583
05:50:15,569 --> 05:50:17,700
Yeah, I mean, it sounds poetic

7584
05:50:17,700 --> 05:50:19,560
but it is deeply true.

7585
05:50:19,560 --> 05:50:22,819
There is an experience,
when it works well,

7586
05:50:22,819 --> 05:50:27,569
it is a joyful, a really
pleasant experience.

7587
05:50:27,569 --> 05:50:28,680
And when it doesn't work well,

7588
05:50:28,680 --> 05:50:30,389
it's a very frustrating experience.

7589
05:50:30,389 --> 05:50:33,156
That's actually the art of UX.

7590
05:50:33,156 --> 05:50:36,959
It's like you have the
possibility to frustrate people

7591
05:50:36,959 --> 05:50:39,003
or the possibility to give them joy,

7592
05:50:40,049 --> 05:50:41,909
- And at the end of the day,
it really is truly the case

7593
05:50:41,909 --> 05:50:43,577
that UX is how the thing works.

7594
05:50:43,577 --> 05:50:45,810
And so it's not just like
what's showing on the screen,

7595
05:50:45,810 --> 05:50:48,060
it's also what control surfaces

7596
05:50:48,060 --> 05:50:49,503
does a decode provide the user?

7597
05:50:49,503 --> 05:50:51,569
Like we want them to feel
like they're in the F1 card,

7598
05:50:51,569 --> 05:50:55,290
not like some like minivan, right?

7599
05:50:55,290 --> 05:50:57,209
And that really truly is
how we think about it.

7600
05:50:57,209 --> 05:50:58,529
Noland himself is an F1 fan,

7601
05:50:58,529 --> 05:51:00,840
so we refer to ourself as a pit crew.

7602
05:51:00,840 --> 05:51:03,180
He really is truly the F1 driver,

7603
05:51:03,180 --> 05:51:05,250
and there's different control surfaces

7604
05:51:05,250 --> 05:51:08,606
that different kinds of cars
and airplanes provide the user.

7605
05:51:08,606 --> 05:51:10,500
And we take a lot of inspiration
from that when designing

7606
05:51:10,500 --> 05:51:11,819
how the cursor should behave..

7607
05:51:11,819 --> 05:51:14,520
And what maybe one nuance of this is,

7608
05:51:14,520 --> 05:51:16,470
even details like when you move a mouse

7609
05:51:16,470 --> 05:51:19,110
on a MacBook track pad,
the sort of response curve

7610
05:51:19,110 --> 05:51:22,889
of how that input that
you give the track pad

7611
05:51:22,889 --> 05:51:24,779
translates to cursor movement is different

7612
05:51:24,779 --> 05:51:26,369
than how it works with a mouse.

7613
05:51:26,369 --> 05:51:27,629
When you move on the track pad,

7614
05:51:27,630 --> 05:51:28,740
there's a different response function,

7615
05:51:28,740 --> 05:51:31,200
a different curve to how much
a movement translates to input

7616
05:51:31,200 --> 05:51:33,479
to the computer than when you
do it physically with a mouse.

7617
05:51:33,479 --> 05:51:35,759
And that's because somebody
sat down a long time ago

7618
05:51:35,759 --> 05:51:37,409
when they're designed
the initial input systems

7619
05:51:37,409 --> 05:51:39,930
to any computer and they
thought through exactly

7620
05:51:39,930 --> 05:51:42,959
how it feels to use
these different systems.

7621
05:51:42,959 --> 05:51:44,639
And now we're designing
sort of the next generation

7622
05:51:44,639 --> 05:51:47,399
of this input system to a
computer, which is entirely done

7623
05:51:47,400 --> 05:51:50,280
via the brain, and there's
no proprioceptive feedback.

7624
05:51:50,279 --> 05:51:52,199
Again, you don't feel
the mouse in your hand,

7625
05:51:52,200 --> 05:51:54,270
you don't feel the keys
under your fingertips,

7626
05:51:54,270 --> 05:51:56,610
and you want a control surface
that still makes it easy

7627
05:51:56,610 --> 05:51:57,840
and intuitive for the user to understand

7628
05:51:57,840 --> 05:51:58,672
the state of the system

7629
05:51:58,672 --> 05:52:00,539
and how to achieve what
they wanna achieve.

7630
05:52:00,540 --> 05:52:03,780
And ultimately, the end goal
is that that UX is completely,

7631
05:52:03,779 --> 05:52:04,680
it fades into the background.

7632
05:52:04,680 --> 05:52:06,689
It becomes something that's
so natural and intuitive

7633
05:52:06,689 --> 05:52:08,309
that it's subconscious to the user,

7634
05:52:08,310 --> 05:52:10,650
and they just should feel
like they have basically

7635
05:52:10,650 --> 05:52:11,780
direct control over the cursor.

7636
05:52:11,779 --> 05:52:13,169
It just does what they want it to do.

7637
05:52:13,169 --> 05:52:14,489
They're not thinking
about the implementation

7638
05:52:14,490 --> 05:52:16,080
of how to make it do
what they want it to do.

7639
05:52:16,080 --> 05:52:17,730
It's just doing what they want it to do.

7640
05:52:17,729 --> 05:52:20,220
- Is there some kind of things

7641
05:52:20,220 --> 05:52:22,560
along the lines of like Fitts' law

7642
05:52:22,560 --> 05:52:25,260
where you should move the
mouse in a certain kind of way

7643
05:52:25,259 --> 05:52:28,919
that maximizes your
chance to hit the target?

7644
05:52:28,919 --> 05:52:30,629
I don't even know what I'm asking,

7645
05:52:30,630 --> 05:52:34,889
but I'm hoping the
intention of my question

7646
05:52:34,889 --> 05:52:37,169
will land on a profound answer.

7647
05:52:37,169 --> 05:52:42,169
No, is there some kind of understanding

7648
05:52:42,810 --> 05:52:46,740
of the laws of UX when
it comes to the context

7649
05:52:48,450 --> 05:52:52,409
of somebody using their
brain to control it?

7650
05:52:52,409 --> 05:52:55,439
Like that's different
than actual with a mouse?

7651
05:52:55,439 --> 05:52:56,729
- I think we're in the early stages

7652
05:52:56,729 --> 05:52:58,889
of discovering those
laws, so I wouldn't claim

7653
05:52:58,889 --> 05:53:01,259
to have solved that problem yet.

7654
05:53:01,259 --> 05:53:03,119
But there's definitely
some things we've learned

7655
05:53:03,119 --> 05:53:08,069
that make it easier for
the user to get stuff done.

7656
05:53:08,069 --> 05:53:10,409
And it's pretty straightforward
when you verbalize it,

7657
05:53:10,409 --> 05:53:11,849
but it takes a while to
actually get to that point

7658
05:53:11,849 --> 05:53:13,349
when you're in the process of debugging

7659
05:53:13,349 --> 05:53:14,669
the stuff in the trenches.

7660
05:53:14,669 --> 05:53:18,899
One of those things is that
any machine learning system

7661
05:53:18,900 --> 05:53:21,360
you build has some number of errors,

7662
05:53:21,360 --> 05:53:24,720
and it matters how those errors translate

7663
05:53:24,720 --> 05:53:25,860
to the downstream user experience.

7664
05:53:25,860 --> 05:53:28,319
For example, if you're
developing a search algorithm

7665
05:53:28,319 --> 05:53:31,319
in your photos, if you
search for your friend Joe

7666
05:53:31,319 --> 05:53:34,229
and it pulls up a photo
of your friend Josephine,

7667
05:53:34,229 --> 05:53:36,899
maybe that's not a big deal
because the cost of an error

7668
05:53:36,900 --> 05:53:38,460
is not that high.

7669
05:53:38,459 --> 05:53:40,319
In a different scenario

7670
05:53:40,319 --> 05:53:43,020
where you're trying to
detect insurance fraud

7671
05:53:43,020 --> 05:53:45,240
or something like this and
you're directly sending someone

7672
05:53:45,240 --> 05:53:47,070
to court because of some
machine learning model output,

7673
05:53:47,069 --> 05:53:50,250
then the errors make a lot
more sense to be careful about.

7674
05:53:50,250 --> 05:53:51,569
You wanna be very thoughtful about

7675
05:53:51,569 --> 05:53:53,310
how those errors translate
to downstream effects.

7676
05:53:53,310 --> 05:53:54,300
The same is true in BCI.

7677
05:53:54,299 --> 05:53:57,329
So for example, if you're building a model

7678
05:53:57,330 --> 05:53:59,730
that's decoding a velocity
output from the brain

7679
05:53:59,729 --> 05:54:01,829
versus an output where
you're trying to modulate

7680
05:54:01,830 --> 05:54:03,150
the left click, for example.

7681
05:54:03,150 --> 05:54:04,530
These have sort of different trade-offs

7682
05:54:04,529 --> 05:54:06,509
of how precise you need to be

7683
05:54:06,509 --> 05:54:08,429
before it becomes useful to the end user.

7684
05:54:08,430 --> 05:54:10,709
For velocity, it's okay
to be on average correct,

7685
05:54:10,709 --> 05:54:13,290
because the output of the model
is integrated through time.

7686
05:54:13,290 --> 05:54:15,750
So if the user's trying
to click at position A,

7687
05:54:15,750 --> 05:54:17,250
and they're currently in position B,

7688
05:54:17,250 --> 05:54:19,080
they're trying to navigate over time

7689
05:54:19,080 --> 05:54:20,610
to get between those two points.

7690
05:54:20,610 --> 05:54:22,610
And as long as the output of the model

7691
05:54:22,610 --> 05:54:24,270
is on average correct,
they can sort of steer it

7692
05:54:24,270 --> 05:54:27,299
through time with the user
control loop in the mix.

7693
05:54:27,299 --> 05:54:29,159
They can get to the
point they wanna get to.

7694
05:54:29,159 --> 05:54:30,840
The same is not true of a click.

7695
05:54:30,840 --> 05:54:33,150
For a click, you're
performing it almost instantly

7696
05:54:33,150 --> 05:54:35,310
at the scale of neurons firing.

7697
05:54:35,310 --> 05:54:38,310
And so you want to be very
sure that that click is correct

7698
05:54:38,310 --> 05:54:40,023
because a false click can be
very destructive to the user.

7699
05:54:40,023 --> 05:54:42,060
They might accidentally close
the tab that they're trying

7700
05:54:42,060 --> 05:54:44,490
to do something and
lose all their progress.

7701
05:54:44,490 --> 05:54:46,560
They might accidentally like

7702
05:54:46,560 --> 05:54:48,600
hit some Send button on some text

7703
05:54:48,599 --> 05:54:51,202
that it's only like half-composed
and reads funny after.

7704
05:54:52,080 --> 05:54:53,970
So there's different
sort of cost functions

7705
05:54:53,970 --> 05:54:54,947
associated with errors in this space.

7706
05:54:54,947 --> 05:54:57,180
And part of the UX design is understanding

7707
05:54:57,180 --> 05:55:00,569
how to build a solution
that is when it's wrong,

7708
05:55:00,569 --> 05:55:02,520
still useful to the end user.

7709
05:55:02,520 --> 05:55:05,229
- It's so fascinating that assigning cost

7710
05:55:06,419 --> 05:55:10,649
to every action when an error occurs.

7711
05:55:10,650 --> 05:55:13,802
So every action, if an error
occurs, has a certain cost,

7712
05:55:14,939 --> 05:55:19,889
and incorporating that into how
you interpret the intention,

7713
05:55:19,889 --> 05:55:23,970
mapping it to the action
is really important.

7714
05:55:23,970 --> 05:55:27,120
I didn't quite until you said it realize

7715
05:55:27,119 --> 05:55:30,479
there's a cost to like
sending the text early.

7716
05:55:30,479 --> 05:55:31,832
It's like very expensive cost.
- Yeah.

7717
05:55:31,832 --> 05:55:33,809
It's super annoying if you accidentally,

7718
05:55:33,810 --> 05:55:36,060
like if you're a cursor,
imagine if your cursor misclick

7719
05:55:36,060 --> 05:55:38,550
every once in a while,
that's like super obnoxious.

7720
05:55:38,549 --> 05:55:40,380
And the worst part of it is, usually,

7721
05:55:40,380 --> 05:55:43,319
when the user's trying to click,
they're also holding still

7722
05:55:43,319 --> 05:55:44,700
because they're over the
target they wanna hit

7723
05:55:44,700 --> 05:55:46,020
and they're getting ready to click,

7724
05:55:46,020 --> 05:55:49,110
which means that in the data
sets that we build, on average,

7725
05:55:49,110 --> 05:55:50,850
it's the case that sort of low speeds

7726
05:55:50,849 --> 05:55:52,019
or desire to hold still.

7727
05:55:52,020 --> 05:55:54,240
It's correlated with when the
user's attempting to click.

7728
05:55:54,240 --> 05:55:56,820
- Wow, that is really fascinating.

7729
05:55:56,819 --> 05:55:58,049
- It's also not the case.

7730
05:55:58,049 --> 05:55:59,880
People think that, "Oh, a
click is a binary signal.

7731
05:55:59,880 --> 05:56:01,380
This must be super easy to decode."

7732
05:56:01,380 --> 05:56:02,580
Well, yes it is,

7733
05:56:02,580 --> 05:56:04,950
but the bar is so much higher for it

7734
05:56:04,950 --> 05:56:06,810
to become a useful thing for the user,

7735
05:56:06,810 --> 05:56:07,740
and there's ways to solve this.

7736
05:56:07,740 --> 05:56:09,159
I mean, you can sort of take
the compound approach of,

7737
05:56:09,159 --> 05:56:11,040
well, let's just give the like,

7738
05:56:11,040 --> 05:56:12,180
let's take five seconds to click.

7739
05:56:12,180 --> 05:56:13,090
Let's take a huge window of time

7740
05:56:13,090 --> 05:56:15,180
so it can be very
confident about the answer.

7741
05:56:15,180 --> 05:56:16,709
But again, world's best mouse.

7742
05:56:16,709 --> 05:56:18,479
The world's best mouse
doesn't take a second to click

7743
05:56:18,479 --> 05:56:19,500
or 500 milliseconds to click.

7744
05:56:19,500 --> 05:56:22,619
It takes five milliseconds
to click or less.

7745
05:56:22,619 --> 05:56:24,659
And so if you're aiming
for that kind of high bar,

7746
05:56:24,659 --> 05:56:26,540
then you really wanna solve
the underlying problem.

7747
05:56:26,540 --> 05:56:28,409
- So maybe this is a
good place to ask about

7748
05:56:28,409 --> 05:56:31,233
how to measure performance,
this whole bits per second.

7749
05:56:32,340 --> 05:56:35,700
Can you like explain
what you mean by that?

7750
05:56:35,700 --> 05:56:37,680
Maybe a good place to start

7751
05:56:37,680 --> 05:56:40,290
is to talk about Webgrid as a game,

7752
05:56:40,290 --> 05:56:43,440
as a good illustration of the
measurement of performance.

7753
05:56:43,439 --> 05:56:45,689
- Yeah, maybe I'll take
one zoom out step there,

7754
05:56:45,689 --> 05:56:49,259
which is just explaining why
we care to measure this at all.

7755
05:56:49,259 --> 05:56:51,869
So again, our goal is to
provide the user the ability

7756
05:56:51,869 --> 05:56:53,520
to control the computer as well as I can

7757
05:56:53,520 --> 05:56:54,450
and hopefully better.

7758
05:56:54,450 --> 05:56:55,530
And that means that they can do it

7759
05:56:55,529 --> 05:56:57,149
at the same speed as what I can do.

7760
05:56:57,150 --> 05:56:57,983
It means that they have access

7761
05:56:57,983 --> 05:57:00,119
to all the same functionality that I have,

7762
05:57:00,119 --> 05:57:02,189
including all those little
details like command tab,

7763
05:57:02,189 --> 05:57:03,367
command space, all this stuff.

7764
05:57:03,367 --> 05:57:04,979
They need to be able to
do it with their brain

7765
05:57:04,979 --> 05:57:06,540
and with the same level of reliability

7766
05:57:06,540 --> 05:57:07,740
as what I can do with my muscles.

7767
05:57:07,740 --> 05:57:08,880
And that's a high bar.

7768
05:57:08,880 --> 05:57:10,470
And so we intend to measure and quantify

7769
05:57:10,470 --> 05:57:11,670
every aspect of that to understand

7770
05:57:11,669 --> 05:57:13,349
how we're progressing towards that goal.

7771
05:57:13,349 --> 05:57:14,669
There's many ways to
measure BPS, by the way.

7772
05:57:14,669 --> 05:57:18,000
This isn't the only way,
but we present the user

7773
05:57:18,000 --> 05:57:19,110
a creative targets, and basically,

7774
05:57:19,110 --> 05:57:22,139
we compute a score which
is dependent on how fast

7775
05:57:22,139 --> 05:57:23,159
and accurate they can select,

7776
05:57:23,159 --> 05:57:24,900
and then how small are the targets.

7777
05:57:24,900 --> 05:57:26,069
And the more targets
that are on the screen,

7778
05:57:26,069 --> 05:57:26,902
the smaller they are,

7779
05:57:26,902 --> 05:57:29,340
the more information
you present per click.

7780
05:57:29,340 --> 05:57:31,409
And so if you think about
it from information theory

7781
05:57:31,409 --> 05:57:32,880
point of view, you can communicate

7782
05:57:32,880 --> 05:57:35,220
across different information
theoretic channels.

7783
05:57:35,220 --> 05:57:37,560
And one such channel is a typing interface

7784
05:57:37,560 --> 05:57:39,450
you could imagine that's
built out of a grid,

7785
05:57:39,450 --> 05:57:41,549
just like a software
keyboard on the screen.

7786
05:57:41,549 --> 05:57:43,950
And bits per second is a
measure that's computed

7787
05:57:43,950 --> 05:57:47,280
by taking the log of the number
of targets on the screen.

7788
05:57:47,279 --> 05:57:49,319
You can subtract one if you
care to model a keyboard

7789
05:57:49,319 --> 05:57:50,340
because you have to subtract one

7790
05:57:50,340 --> 05:57:51,959
for the Delete key on the keyboard,

7791
05:57:51,959 --> 05:57:54,149
but log of the number
of targets on the screen

7792
05:57:54,150 --> 05:57:56,909
times the number of correct
selections minus incorrect,

7793
05:57:56,909 --> 05:57:58,229
divided by some time window.

7794
05:57:58,229 --> 05:57:59,909
For example, 60 seconds.

7795
05:57:59,909 --> 05:58:00,959
And that's sort of the standard way

7796
05:58:00,959 --> 05:58:03,419
to measure a cursor
control task in academia.

7797
05:58:03,419 --> 05:58:05,699
And all credit in the world
goes to this great professor,

7798
05:58:05,700 --> 05:58:07,827
Dr. Shenoy of Stanford who
came up with that task.

7799
05:58:07,827 --> 05:58:09,990
And he's also one of my
inspirations for being in the field.

7800
05:58:09,990 --> 05:58:11,909
So all the credit in the world to him

7801
05:58:11,909 --> 05:58:13,619
for coming up with a standardized metric

7802
05:58:13,619 --> 05:58:15,869
to facilitate this kind of
bragging rights that we have now,

7803
05:58:15,869 --> 05:58:17,879
to say that Noland is
the best in the world

7804
05:58:17,880 --> 05:58:18,900
at this task with his BCI.

7805
05:58:18,900 --> 05:58:19,950
It's very important for progress

7806
05:58:19,950 --> 05:58:22,110
that you have standardized
metrics that people can compare

7807
05:58:22,110 --> 05:58:24,119
across different
techniques and approaches.

7808
05:58:24,119 --> 05:58:25,439
How well does this do?

7809
05:58:25,439 --> 05:58:28,340
So yeah, big kudos to him and
to all the team at Stanford.

7810
05:58:29,400 --> 05:58:34,050
Yeah, so for Noland, and
for me playing this task,

7811
05:58:34,049 --> 05:58:35,130
there's also different modes

7812
05:58:35,130 --> 05:58:36,090
that you can configure this task.

7813
05:58:36,090 --> 05:58:37,380
So the Webgrid task can be presented

7814
05:58:37,380 --> 05:58:39,110
as just sort of a left
click on the screen,

7815
05:58:39,110 --> 05:58:41,790
or you could have targets
that you just dwell over,

7816
05:58:41,790 --> 05:58:43,650
or you could have targets
that you left, right click on.

7817
05:58:43,650 --> 05:58:45,600
You could have targets
that are left, right click,

7818
05:58:45,599 --> 05:58:47,279
middle click, scrolling,
clicking, and dragging.

7819
05:58:47,279 --> 05:58:48,149
You could do all sorts of things

7820
05:58:48,150 --> 05:58:49,860
within this general framework.

7821
05:58:49,860 --> 05:58:52,170
But the simplest, purest
form is just blue targets

7822
05:58:52,169 --> 05:58:53,002
show up on the screen.

7823
05:58:53,003 --> 05:58:54,029
Blue means left click.

7824
05:58:54,029 --> 05:58:56,181
That's the simplest form of the game.

7825
05:58:56,181 --> 05:59:01,181
And the sort of prior
records here in academic work

7826
05:59:01,529 --> 05:59:04,259
and at Neuralink internally

7827
05:59:04,259 --> 05:59:07,379
with sort of NPS have all been matched

7828
05:59:07,380 --> 05:59:09,479
or beaten by Noland with
his Neuralink device.

7829
05:59:09,479 --> 05:59:12,810
So sort of prior to Neuralink,
the sort of world record

7830
05:59:12,810 --> 05:59:15,356
for a human using device
is somewhere between

7831
05:59:15,356 --> 05:59:17,880
4.2 to 4.6 BPS, depending on exactly

7832
05:59:17,880 --> 05:59:19,950
what paper you read and
how you interpret it.

7833
05:59:19,950 --> 05:59:23,190
Noland's current record is 8.5 BPS.

7834
05:59:23,189 --> 05:59:24,599
And again, this sort of median

7835
05:59:24,599 --> 05:59:25,876
Neuralink performance is 10 BPS.

7836
05:59:25,877 --> 05:59:28,467
So you can think of it roughly as he's 85%

7837
05:59:28,467 --> 05:59:31,229
the level of control
of a median Neuralinker

7838
05:59:31,229 --> 05:59:33,959
using their cursor to select
blue targets on the screen.

7839
05:59:33,959 --> 05:59:38,959
And yeah, I think there's a
very interesting journey ahead

7840
05:59:39,990 --> 05:59:42,390
to get us to that same
level of 10 BPS performance.

7841
05:59:42,389 --> 05:59:44,399
It's not the case that sort
of the tricks that got us

7842
05:59:44,400 --> 05:59:47,670
from four to six BPS,
and then six to eight BPS

7843
05:59:47,669 --> 05:59:49,739
are gonna be the ones that
get us from eight to 10.

7844
05:59:49,740 --> 05:59:51,570
And in my view, the core challenge here

7845
05:59:51,569 --> 05:59:52,770
is really the labeling problem.

7846
05:59:52,770 --> 05:59:55,830
It's how do you understand at
a very, very fine resolution

7847
05:59:55,830 --> 05:59:57,600
what the user's attempting to do.

7848
05:59:57,599 --> 05:59:59,219
And yeah, I highly encourage folks

7849
05:59:59,220 --> 06:00:01,350
in academia to work on this problem.

7850
06:00:01,349 --> 06:00:04,590
- What's the journey
with Noland on that quest

7851
06:00:04,590 --> 06:00:06,990
of increasing the BPS on Webgrid?

7852
06:00:06,990 --> 06:00:09,240
In March, you said that he selected

7853
06:00:09,240 --> 06:00:12,540
89,285 targets in Webgrid.

7854
06:00:12,540 --> 06:00:14,880
- Yep.
- So he loves this game.

7855
06:00:14,880 --> 06:00:16,740
He's really serious about improving

7856
06:00:16,740 --> 06:00:18,120
his performance in this game.

7857
06:00:18,119 --> 06:00:20,489
So what is that journey
of trying to figure out

7858
06:00:20,490 --> 06:00:21,659
how to improve that performance?

7859
06:00:21,659 --> 06:00:24,779
How much can that be done
on the decoding side?

7860
06:00:24,779 --> 06:00:27,360
How much can that be done
on the calibration side?

7861
06:00:27,360 --> 06:00:30,450
How much can that be
done on the Noland side

7862
06:00:30,450 --> 06:00:34,290
of like figuring out how to convey

7863
06:00:34,290 --> 06:00:36,780
his intention more cleanly?

7864
06:00:36,779 --> 06:00:38,279
- Yeah, no, this is a great question.

7865
06:00:38,279 --> 06:00:41,399
So in my view, one of
the primary reasons why

7866
06:00:41,400 --> 06:00:43,380
Noland's performance is so
good is because of Noland.

7867
06:00:43,380 --> 06:00:47,370
Noland is extremely
focused and very energetic.

7868
06:00:47,369 --> 06:00:49,889
He'll play Webgrid sometimes
for like four hours

7869
06:00:49,889 --> 06:00:50,722
in the middle of the night.

7870
06:00:50,723 --> 06:00:53,100
Like from 2:00 AM to 6:00
AM, he'll be playing Webgrid,

7871
06:00:53,099 --> 06:00:54,289
just because he wants to push it

7872
06:00:54,290 --> 06:00:56,030
to the limits of what he can do.

7873
06:00:56,029 --> 06:00:57,983
And this is not us like
asking him to do that.

7874
06:00:57,983 --> 06:00:58,979
I wanna be clear.

7875
06:00:58,979 --> 06:01:00,037
Like we're not saying,

7876
06:01:00,037 --> 06:01:01,319
"Hey, you should play Webgrid tonight."

7877
06:01:01,319 --> 06:01:04,229
We just gave him the game
as part of our research,

7878
06:01:04,229 --> 06:01:06,270
and he is able to play it independently

7879
06:01:06,270 --> 06:01:07,409
and practice whenever he wants,

7880
06:01:07,409 --> 06:01:09,540
and he really pushes hard to push it,

7881
06:01:09,540 --> 06:01:11,190
the technology's the absolute limit.

7882
06:01:11,189 --> 06:01:13,319
And he views that as like his job really

7883
06:01:13,319 --> 06:01:15,090
to make us be the bottleneck.

7884
06:01:15,090 --> 06:01:16,799
And boy, has he done that well.

7885
06:01:16,799 --> 06:01:19,139
And so the first thing
to acknowledge is that

7886
06:01:19,139 --> 06:01:21,239
he's extremely motivated
to make this work.

7887
06:01:21,240 --> 06:01:23,280
I've also had the privilege to meet other

7888
06:01:23,279 --> 06:01:25,979
clinical trial participants
from BrainGate and other trials,

7889
06:01:25,979 --> 06:01:27,419
and they very much
shared the same attitude

7890
06:01:27,419 --> 06:01:29,669
of like they view this
as their life's work

7891
06:01:29,669 --> 06:01:33,329
to advance the technology
as much as they can.

7892
06:01:33,330 --> 06:01:35,250
And if that means selecting
targets on the screen

7893
06:01:35,250 --> 06:01:38,246
for four hours from 2:00 AM
to 6:00 AM, then so be it.

7894
06:01:38,246 --> 06:01:40,259
And there's something
extremely admirable about that

7895
06:01:40,259 --> 06:01:42,359
that's worth calling out.

7896
06:01:42,360 --> 06:01:44,940
Okay, so then how do you sort of get from

7897
06:01:44,939 --> 06:01:47,849
where he started, which is
no cursor control to a BPS?

7898
06:01:47,849 --> 06:01:48,959
So I mean, when he started,

7899
06:01:48,959 --> 06:01:51,149
there's a huge amount of learning to do

7900
06:01:51,150 --> 06:01:53,670
on his side and our side to figure out

7901
06:01:53,669 --> 06:01:56,039
what's the most intuitive control for him.

7902
06:01:56,040 --> 06:01:58,860
And the most intuitive
control for him is sort of,

7903
06:01:58,860 --> 06:02:00,360
you have to find the set intersection

7904
06:02:00,360 --> 06:02:02,670
of what do we have this signal to decode.

7905
06:02:02,669 --> 06:02:05,039
So we don't pick up every single
neuron in the motor cortex,

7906
06:02:05,040 --> 06:02:06,209
which means we don't have representation

7907
06:02:06,209 --> 06:02:07,379
for every part of the body.

7908
06:02:07,380 --> 06:02:09,360
So there may be some
signals that we have better

7909
06:02:09,360 --> 06:02:11,190
sort of decode performance on than others.

7910
06:02:11,189 --> 06:02:14,009
For example, on his left hand,
we have a lot of difficulty

7911
06:02:14,009 --> 06:02:16,079
distinguishing his left ring finger

7912
06:02:16,080 --> 06:02:17,700
from his left middle finger.

7913
06:02:17,700 --> 06:02:20,459
But on his right hand,
we have a good control

7914
06:02:20,459 --> 06:02:21,292
and good modulation
detected from the neurons

7915
06:02:21,293 --> 06:02:23,083
that we're able to record for his pinky,

7916
06:02:23,082 --> 06:02:24,719
his thumb, and his index finger.

7917
06:02:24,720 --> 06:02:26,800
So you can imagine how these different

7918
06:02:28,169 --> 06:02:30,269
sub spaces of modulated activity

7919
06:02:30,270 --> 06:02:32,130
intersect with what's the
most intuitive for him.

7920
06:02:32,130 --> 06:02:33,360
And this has evolved over time.

7921
06:02:33,360 --> 06:02:34,680
So once we gave him the ability

7922
06:02:34,680 --> 06:02:36,240
to calibrate models on his own,

7923
06:02:36,240 --> 06:02:38,550
he was able to go and explore
various different ways

7924
06:02:38,549 --> 06:02:40,290
to imagine controlling the cursor.

7925
06:02:40,290 --> 06:02:41,790
For example, he could imagine
controlling the cursor

7926
06:02:41,790 --> 06:02:43,620
by wiggling his wrist side to side,

7927
06:02:43,619 --> 06:02:44,789
or by moving his entire arm.

7928
06:02:44,790 --> 06:02:46,229
I think at one point, he did his feet.

7929
06:02:46,229 --> 06:02:48,959
He tried like a whole bunch
of stuff to explore the space

7930
06:02:48,959 --> 06:02:51,090
of what is the most natural way for him

7931
06:02:51,090 --> 06:02:52,229
to control the cursor.

7932
06:02:52,229 --> 06:02:53,913
That at the same time, it's
easy for us to decode rules.

7933
06:02:53,913 --> 06:02:58,172
- Just to clarify, it's through
the body mapping procedure

7934
06:02:58,172 --> 06:03:02,669
that you're able to figure
out which finger he can move?

7935
06:03:02,669 --> 06:03:04,469
- Yes, yeah, that's one way to do it.

7936
06:03:04,470 --> 06:03:08,069
Maybe one nuance of when he's doing it,

7937
06:03:08,069 --> 06:03:09,273
he can imagine many more things

7938
06:03:09,273 --> 06:03:11,370
than we represent in that
visual on the screen.

7939
06:03:11,369 --> 06:03:14,520
So we show him sort of
abstractly, "Here's a cursor.

7940
06:03:14,520 --> 06:03:17,430
You figure out what
works the best for you."

7941
06:03:17,430 --> 06:03:19,349
And we obviously have hints
about what will work best

7942
06:03:19,349 --> 06:03:20,459
from that body mapping procedure

7943
06:03:20,459 --> 06:03:22,709
of we know that this particular action,

7944
06:03:22,709 --> 06:03:23,819
we can represent well.

7945
06:03:23,819 --> 06:03:25,169
But it's really up to
him to go and explore

7946
06:03:25,169 --> 06:03:27,089
and figure out what works the best.

7947
06:03:27,090 --> 06:03:30,479
- But at which point does
he no longer visualize

7948
06:03:30,479 --> 06:03:32,549
the movement of his body
and is just visualizing

7949
06:03:32,549 --> 06:03:33,809
the movement of the cursor?

7950
06:03:33,810 --> 06:03:35,807
- Yeah.
- How quickly does he go from,

7951
06:03:35,807 --> 06:03:37,280
how quickly does he get there?

7952
06:03:37,279 --> 06:03:38,909
- So this happened on a Tuesday.

7953
06:03:38,909 --> 06:03:40,409
I remember this day very clearly,

7954
06:03:40,409 --> 06:03:43,560
because at some point during the day,

7955
06:03:43,560 --> 06:03:44,617
it looked like he wasn't doing super well.

7956
06:03:44,616 --> 06:03:46,979
It looked like the model
wasn't performing super well

7957
06:03:46,979 --> 06:03:48,630
and he was like getting distracted.

7958
06:03:48,630 --> 06:03:49,770
But he actually, it wasn't the case.

7959
06:03:49,770 --> 06:03:53,130
Like what actually happened
was he was trying something new

7960
06:03:53,130 --> 06:03:55,799
where he was just controlling the cursor.

7961
06:03:55,799 --> 06:03:57,930
So he wasn't imagining
moving his hand anymore.

7962
06:03:57,930 --> 06:03:59,970
He was just imagining,
I don't know what it is,

7963
06:03:59,970 --> 06:04:01,050
some like abstract intention

7964
06:04:01,049 --> 06:04:02,729
to move the cursor on the screen.

7965
06:04:02,729 --> 06:04:04,649
And I cannot tell you what the difference

7966
06:04:04,650 --> 06:04:05,610
between those two things are.

7967
06:04:05,610 --> 06:04:06,690
I really truly cannot.

7968
06:04:06,689 --> 06:04:08,039
He's tried to explain it to me before.

7969
06:04:08,040 --> 06:04:12,209
I cannot give a first person
account of what that's like.

7970
06:04:12,209 --> 06:04:14,129
But the expletives that
he uttered in that moment

7971
06:04:14,130 --> 06:04:16,409
were enough to suggest

7972
06:04:16,409 --> 06:04:18,540
that it was a very qualitatively
different experience

7973
06:04:18,540 --> 06:04:22,113
for him to just have direct
neural control over a cursor.

7974
06:04:23,669 --> 06:04:27,869
- I wonder if there's a way through UX

7975
06:04:27,869 --> 06:04:30,869
to encourage a human
being to discover that,

7976
06:04:30,869 --> 06:04:33,663
because he discovered
it, like you said to me,

7977
06:04:33,663 --> 06:04:35,369
that he's a pioneer.

7978
06:04:35,369 --> 06:04:38,819
So he discovered that on
his own through all of this,

7979
06:04:38,819 --> 06:04:42,150
the process of trying to move the cursor

7980
06:04:42,150 --> 06:04:44,280
with different kinds of intentions.

7981
06:04:44,279 --> 06:04:47,369
But that is clearly a really
powerful thing to arrive at,

7982
06:04:47,369 --> 06:04:52,369
which is to let go of trying
to control the fingers

7983
06:04:52,650 --> 06:04:54,930
and the hand and control the actual

7984
06:04:54,930 --> 06:04:56,220
digital device with your mind.

7985
06:04:56,220 --> 06:04:57,810
- That's right, UX is how it works.

7986
06:04:57,810 --> 06:05:00,870
And the ideal UX is one
that the user doesn't

7987
06:05:00,869 --> 06:05:02,890
have to think about what they need to do

7988
06:05:02,890 --> 06:05:04,879
in order to get it done.

7989
06:05:04,879 --> 06:05:05,711
It just does it.

7990
06:05:07,080 --> 06:05:08,040
- That is so fascinating.

7991
06:05:08,040 --> 06:05:11,310
But I wonder on the biological side

7992
06:05:11,310 --> 06:05:13,380
how long it takes for the brain to adapt.

7993
06:05:13,380 --> 06:05:15,720
- Yeah.
- So is it just simply

7994
06:05:15,720 --> 06:05:19,350
learning like high level software,

7995
06:05:19,349 --> 06:05:21,509
or is there like a
neuroplasticity component

7996
06:05:21,509 --> 06:05:25,049
where like the brain is adjusting slowly?

7997
06:05:25,049 --> 06:05:27,809
- Yeah, the truth is, I don't know.

7998
06:05:27,810 --> 06:05:30,180
I'm very excited to see with
sort of the second participant

7999
06:05:30,180 --> 06:05:34,020
that we implant what the
journey is like for them,

8000
06:05:34,020 --> 06:05:35,700
because we'll have learned a lot more.

8001
06:05:35,700 --> 06:05:37,139
Potentially, we can help them understand

8002
06:05:37,139 --> 06:05:38,152
and explore that direction more quickly.

8003
06:05:38,152 --> 06:05:39,779
This is something I didn't know.

8004
06:05:39,779 --> 06:05:42,479
This wasn't me prompting
Noland to go try this.

8005
06:05:42,479 --> 06:05:44,939
He was just exploring
how to use his device

8006
06:05:44,939 --> 06:05:46,169
and figure it out himself.

8007
06:05:46,169 --> 06:05:48,089
But now that we know that
that's a possibility,

8008
06:05:48,090 --> 06:05:49,560
that maybe there's a way to, for example,

8009
06:05:49,560 --> 06:05:52,290
hint the user, "Don't try
super hard during calibration.

8010
06:05:52,290 --> 06:05:53,850
Just do something that feels natural,

8011
06:05:53,849 --> 06:05:55,680
or just directly control the cursor.

8012
06:05:55,680 --> 06:05:57,420
Don't imagine explicit action."

8013
06:05:57,419 --> 06:05:59,759
And from there, we should be
able to hopefully understand

8014
06:05:59,759 --> 06:06:00,719
how this is for somebody

8015
06:06:00,720 --> 06:06:02,430
who has not experienced that before.

8016
06:06:02,430 --> 06:06:04,229
Maybe that's the default
mode of operation for them.

8017
06:06:04,229 --> 06:06:05,369
You don't have to go through this

8018
06:06:05,369 --> 06:06:07,739
intermediate phase of explicit motions.

8019
06:06:07,740 --> 06:06:10,140
- Or maybe if that naturally
happens for people,

8020
06:06:10,139 --> 06:06:12,779
you can just occasionally encourage them

8021
06:06:12,779 --> 06:06:14,789
to allow themselves to move the cursor.

8022
06:06:14,790 --> 06:06:17,370
Actually sometimes, just
like with a four minute mile,

8023
06:06:17,369 --> 06:06:19,289
just the knowledge that that's possible.

8024
06:06:19,290 --> 06:06:20,580
- Pushes you to do it.

8025
06:06:20,580 --> 06:06:22,469
- Yeah, enables you to do it,

8026
06:06:22,469 --> 06:06:24,000
and then it becomes trivial.

8027
06:06:24,000 --> 06:06:26,094
And then it also makes you wonder,

8028
06:06:26,094 --> 06:06:28,020
it's the cool thing about humans.

8029
06:06:28,020 --> 06:06:31,020
Once there's a lot more
human participants,

8030
06:06:31,020 --> 06:06:32,909
they will discover
things that are possible.

8031
06:06:32,909 --> 06:06:34,590
- Yes, and share their experiences.

8032
06:06:34,590 --> 06:06:35,422
- Yeah, and share.
- With each other.

8033
06:06:35,422 --> 06:06:37,979
- And that because of them sharing it,

8034
06:06:37,979 --> 06:06:39,453
they'll be able to do it.

8035
06:06:40,349 --> 06:06:43,139
All of a sudden, that's
unlocked for everybody,

8036
06:06:43,139 --> 06:06:44,700
because just the knowledge sometimes

8037
06:06:44,700 --> 06:06:46,743
is the thing that enables it to do it.

8038
06:06:46,742 --> 06:06:49,379
- Yeah, I mean, and just
to comment on that too,

8039
06:06:49,380 --> 06:06:51,180
we've probably tried like
a thousand different ways

8040
06:06:51,180 --> 06:06:54,180
to do various aspects of decoding,

8041
06:06:54,180 --> 06:06:55,670
and now we know like what
the right subspace is

8042
06:06:55,669 --> 06:06:56,759
to continue exploring further.

8043
06:06:56,759 --> 06:06:57,626
Again, thanks to Noland

8044
06:06:57,627 --> 06:06:59,516
and the many hours he's put into this.

8045
06:06:59,516 --> 06:07:01,259
And so even just that help,

8046
06:07:01,259 --> 06:07:02,729
like help constraints
sort of the beam search

8047
06:07:02,729 --> 06:07:04,829
of different approaches
that we could explore

8048
06:07:04,830 --> 06:07:07,550
really helps accelerate
for the next person

8049
06:07:07,549 --> 06:07:09,090
the set of things that
we'll get to try on day one,

8050
06:07:09,090 --> 06:07:11,279
how fast we hope to get
them to useful control,

8051
06:07:11,279 --> 06:07:13,469
how fast we can enable 'em
to use it independently,

8052
06:07:13,470 --> 06:07:14,630
and to get value out of the system.

8053
06:07:14,630 --> 06:07:16,979
So yeah, massive hats off to Noland

8054
06:07:16,979 --> 06:07:19,290
and all the participants
that came before him

8055
06:07:19,290 --> 06:07:20,880
to make this technology a reality.

8056
06:07:20,880 --> 06:07:22,920
- So how often are the
updates to the decoder?

8057
06:07:22,919 --> 06:07:24,599
'Cause Noland mentioned like,

8058
06:07:24,599 --> 06:07:26,579
okay, there's a new update
that we're working on,

8059
06:07:26,580 --> 06:07:29,190
and that in the stream, he said

8060
06:07:29,189 --> 06:07:33,449
he plays the snake game
because it's like super hard.

8061
06:07:33,450 --> 06:07:36,450
It's a good way for him to test
like how good the update is.

8062
06:07:37,467 --> 06:07:41,100
And he says like sometimes the
update is a step backwards.

8063
06:07:41,099 --> 06:07:42,932
It's a constant like iteration.

8064
06:07:44,400 --> 06:07:46,050
Like what does the update entail?

8065
06:07:46,049 --> 06:07:48,750
Is it mostly on the decoder side?

8066
06:07:48,750 --> 06:07:49,650
- Yeah, a couple comments.

8067
06:07:49,650 --> 06:07:51,540
So one is it's probably
worth drawing distinction

8068
06:07:51,540 --> 06:07:52,740
between sort of research sessions

8069
06:07:52,740 --> 06:07:54,480
where we're actively
trying different things

8070
06:07:54,479 --> 06:07:56,489
to understand like what
the best approach is

8071
06:07:56,490 --> 06:07:58,700
versus sort of independent
use where we wanted to have

8072
06:07:58,700 --> 06:08:00,360
an ability to just go use the device,

8073
06:08:00,360 --> 06:08:02,490
how anybody would wanna use their MacBook.

8074
06:08:02,490 --> 06:08:04,170
And so what he's referring to is,

8075
06:08:04,169 --> 06:08:05,909
I think usually in the
context of a research session,

8076
06:08:05,909 --> 06:08:08,340
where we're trying many,
many different approaches

8077
06:08:08,340 --> 06:08:09,683
to even unsupervised approaches

8078
06:08:09,683 --> 06:08:10,920
like we talked about earlier

8079
06:08:10,919 --> 06:08:12,539
to try to come up with better ways

8080
06:08:12,540 --> 06:08:14,010
to estimate his true intention

8081
06:08:14,009 --> 06:08:15,689
and more accurately decode it.

8082
06:08:15,689 --> 06:08:18,270
And in those scenarios, I mean we try,

8083
06:08:18,270 --> 06:08:20,069
in any given session, he'll sometimes work

8084
06:08:20,069 --> 06:08:21,479
for like eight hours a day.

8085
06:08:21,479 --> 06:08:23,520
And so that can be hundreds
of different models

8086
06:08:23,520 --> 06:08:24,840
that we would try in that day.

8087
06:08:24,840 --> 06:08:27,330
Like a lot of different things.

8088
06:08:27,330 --> 06:08:29,310
Now, it's also worth noting that we update

8089
06:08:29,310 --> 06:08:30,840
the application he uses quite frequently.

8090
06:08:30,840 --> 06:08:33,389
I think sometimes, up to like
four or five times a day.

8091
06:08:33,389 --> 06:08:35,369
We'll update his application
with different features

8092
06:08:35,369 --> 06:08:37,983
or bug fixes or feedback
that he's given us.

8093
06:08:39,563 --> 06:08:42,674
He's a very articulate person
who is part of the solution.

8094
06:08:42,674 --> 06:08:43,590
He's not a complaining person.

8095
06:08:43,590 --> 06:08:46,049
He says, "Hey, here's this
thing that I've discovered

8096
06:08:46,049 --> 06:08:47,969
is not optimal in my flow.

8097
06:08:47,970 --> 06:08:49,260
Here's some ideas how to fix it.

8098
06:08:49,259 --> 06:08:50,250
Let me know what your thoughts are.

8099
06:08:50,250 --> 06:08:51,990
Let's figure out how to solve it."

8100
06:08:51,990 --> 06:08:54,420
And it often happens that
those things are addressed

8101
06:08:54,419 --> 06:08:57,149
within a couple hours of
him giving us his feedback.

8102
06:08:57,150 --> 06:08:58,257
That's the kind of
iteration cycle we'll have.

8103
06:08:58,257 --> 06:09:00,120
And so sometimes, at the
beginning of the session,

8104
06:09:00,119 --> 06:09:01,658
he'll give us feedback, and
at the end of the session,

8105
06:09:01,658 --> 06:09:03,810
he's giving us feedback
on the next iteration

8106
06:09:03,810 --> 06:09:06,060
of that process or that set up.

8107
06:09:06,060 --> 06:09:07,530
- That's fascinating,
because one of the things

8108
06:09:07,529 --> 06:09:11,039
you mentioned, that there
was 271 pages of notes

8109
06:09:11,040 --> 06:09:14,549
taken from the BCI sessions,
and this was just in March.

8110
06:09:14,549 --> 06:09:17,250
So one of the amazing
things about human beings

8111
06:09:17,250 --> 06:09:20,849
that they can provide,
especially ones who are smart

8112
06:09:20,849 --> 06:09:25,439
and excited and all like positive
and good vibes like Nolan,

8113
06:09:25,439 --> 06:09:27,750
that they can provide
feedback, continuous feedback.

8114
06:09:27,750 --> 06:09:29,369
- Yeah, it also requires,

8115
06:09:29,369 --> 06:09:30,779
just to brag on the team a little bit,

8116
06:09:30,779 --> 06:09:33,389
I work with a lot of exceptional people,

8117
06:09:33,389 --> 06:09:36,149
and it requires the team
being absolutely laser focused

8118
06:09:36,150 --> 06:09:38,730
on the user and what will
be the best for them.

8119
06:09:38,729 --> 06:09:40,926
And it requires like a
level of commitment of,

8120
06:09:40,926 --> 06:09:41,953
"Okay, this is what the user feedback was.

8121
06:09:41,953 --> 06:09:43,350
I have all these meetings.

8122
06:09:43,349 --> 06:09:45,566
We're gonna skip that today
and we're gonna do this."

8123
06:09:45,566 --> 06:09:49,704
That level of focus
commitment is, I would say,

8124
06:09:49,705 --> 06:09:52,680
underappreciated in the world.

8125
06:09:52,680 --> 06:09:54,869
And also, you obviously
have to have the talent

8126
06:09:54,869 --> 06:09:56,969
to be able to execute on
these things effectively.

8127
06:09:56,970 --> 06:10:00,120
And yeah, we have that in loads.

8128
06:10:00,119 --> 06:10:05,069
- Yeah, and this is such a
interesting space of UX design

8129
06:10:05,069 --> 06:10:08,372
because there's so many unknowns here.

8130
06:10:09,419 --> 06:10:13,049
And I can tell UX is difficult

8131
06:10:13,049 --> 06:10:15,362
because of how many people do it poorly.

8132
06:10:17,279 --> 06:10:19,289
It's just not a trivial thing.

8133
06:10:19,290 --> 06:10:20,610
- Yeah, it's also, you know,

8134
06:10:20,610 --> 06:10:23,700
UX is not something that
you can always solve

8135
06:10:23,700 --> 06:10:25,830
by just constant iterating
on different things.

8136
06:10:25,830 --> 06:10:27,180
Like sometimes, you
really need to step back

8137
06:10:27,180 --> 06:10:29,580
and think globally, am
I even in like the right

8138
06:10:29,580 --> 06:10:32,130
sort of minima to be
chasing down for a solution?

8139
06:10:32,130 --> 06:10:33,330
Like there's a lot of problems in which

8140
06:10:33,330 --> 06:10:36,360
sort of fast iteration
cycle is the predictor

8141
06:10:36,360 --> 06:10:37,383
of how successful you will be.

8142
06:10:37,383 --> 06:10:40,950
As a good example, like in
RL simulation, for example,

8143
06:10:40,950 --> 06:10:42,240
the more frequently you get reward,

8144
06:10:42,240 --> 06:10:44,100
the faster you can progress.

8145
06:10:44,099 --> 06:10:44,996
It's just an easier learning prompt,

8146
06:10:44,996 --> 06:10:46,799
the more frequently you get feedback.

8147
06:10:46,799 --> 06:10:47,742
But UX is not that way.

8148
06:10:47,742 --> 06:10:50,399
I mean, users are
actually quite often wrong

8149
06:10:50,400 --> 06:10:52,050
about what the right solution is,

8150
06:10:52,049 --> 06:10:54,779
and it requires a deep understanding
of the technical system

8151
06:10:54,779 --> 06:10:56,069
and what's possible,

8152
06:10:56,069 --> 06:10:58,380
combined with what the problem
is you're trying to solve.

8153
06:10:58,380 --> 06:10:59,610
Not just how the user expressed it,

8154
06:10:59,610 --> 06:11:01,770
but what the true underlying problem is

8155
06:11:01,770 --> 06:11:04,080
to actually get to the right place.

8156
06:11:04,080 --> 06:11:05,580
- Yeah, that's the old like stories

8157
06:11:05,580 --> 06:11:08,193
of Steve Jobs like rolling in there, like,

8158
06:11:09,090 --> 06:11:11,459
yeah, the user is a useful signal,

8159
06:11:11,459 --> 06:11:13,290
but it's not a perfect signal.

8160
06:11:13,290 --> 06:11:15,740
And sometimes, you have to
remove the floppy disk drive

8161
06:11:15,740 --> 06:11:18,840
or whatever the, I forgot
all the crazy stories

8162
06:11:18,840 --> 06:11:23,840
of Steve Jobs like making
wild design decisions.

8163
06:11:24,270 --> 06:11:27,153
But there, some of it is aesthetic,

8164
06:11:29,250 --> 06:11:33,810
that some of it is about the
love you put into the design,

8165
06:11:33,810 --> 06:11:36,783
which is very much a Steve
Jobs-Jony Ive type of thing.

8166
06:11:38,340 --> 06:11:41,610
But when you have a human
being using their brain

8167
06:11:41,610 --> 06:11:45,180
to interact with it, it also
is deeply about function.

8168
06:11:45,180 --> 06:11:46,712
It's not just aesthetic.

8169
06:11:47,669 --> 06:11:50,189
And that you have to empathize

8170
06:11:50,189 --> 06:11:52,500
with a human being before you,

8171
06:11:52,500 --> 06:11:54,962
while not always listening
to them directly.

8172
06:11:55,919 --> 06:11:58,289
Like you have to deeply empathize.

8173
06:11:58,290 --> 06:11:59,880
It's fascinating.

8174
06:11:59,880 --> 06:12:02,010
It's really, really fascinating.

8175
06:12:02,009 --> 06:12:03,750
And at the same time, iterate.

8176
06:12:03,750 --> 06:12:05,310
But not iterate in small ways.

8177
06:12:05,310 --> 06:12:08,940
Sometimes, a complete like
rebuilding the design.

8178
06:12:08,939 --> 06:12:10,529
He said that,

8179
06:12:10,529 --> 06:12:13,079
Noland said in the early
days, the UX sucked.

8180
06:12:13,080 --> 06:12:14,730
But you improved quickly.

8181
06:12:14,729 --> 06:12:16,470
What was that journey like?

8182
06:12:16,470 --> 06:12:19,050
- Yeah, I mean, I'll give
one concrete example.

8183
06:12:19,049 --> 06:12:22,139
So he really wanted to
be able to read manga.

8184
06:12:22,139 --> 06:12:23,880
This is something that he, I mean,

8185
06:12:23,880 --> 06:12:25,132
it sounds like a simple thing,

8186
06:12:25,132 --> 06:12:26,757
but it's actually a
really big deal for him.

8187
06:12:26,757 --> 06:12:28,800
And he couldn't do it
with his mouth stick.

8188
06:12:28,799 --> 06:12:29,729
It wasn't accessible.

8189
06:12:29,729 --> 06:12:32,579
You can't scroll with a
mouse stick on his iPad

8190
06:12:32,580 --> 06:12:34,200
on the website that he
wanted to be able to use

8191
06:12:34,200 --> 06:12:36,030
to read the newest manga.

8192
06:12:36,029 --> 06:12:37,110
- Might be a good quick pause

8193
06:12:37,110 --> 06:12:40,020
to say the mouth stick
is the thing he's using,

8194
06:12:40,020 --> 06:12:44,159
holding a stick in his
mouth to scroll on a tablet.

8195
06:12:44,159 --> 06:12:45,318
- Right, yeah, it's basically,

8196
06:12:45,318 --> 06:12:46,290
you can imagine it's a stylus

8197
06:12:46,290 --> 06:12:47,310
that you hold between your teeth.

8198
06:12:47,310 --> 06:12:48,780
Yeah, it's basically a very long stylus.

8199
06:12:48,779 --> 06:12:50,432
- And it's exhausting,

8200
06:12:51,360 --> 06:12:54,510
it hurts, and it's inefficient.

8201
06:12:54,509 --> 06:12:56,159
- Yeah, and maybe it's
also worth calling out,

8202
06:12:56,159 --> 06:12:57,930
there are other alternative
assisted technologies,

8203
06:12:57,930 --> 06:13:00,540
but the particular situation Noland's in,

8204
06:13:00,540 --> 06:13:01,650
and this is not uncommon,

8205
06:13:01,650 --> 06:13:04,020
and I think it's also not
well understood by folks,

8206
06:13:04,020 --> 06:13:06,090
is that he's relatively spastic

8207
06:13:06,090 --> 06:13:07,886
so he'll have muscle
spasms from time to time.

8208
06:13:07,886 --> 06:13:09,809
And so any assistive
technology that requires him

8209
06:13:09,810 --> 06:13:11,370
to be positioned directly
in front of a camera,

8210
06:13:11,369 --> 06:13:12,719
for example, an eye tracker,

8211
06:13:12,720 --> 06:13:15,300
or anything that requires him
to put something in his mouth

8212
06:13:15,299 --> 06:13:17,279
just is a no go, 'cause he'll either

8213
06:13:17,279 --> 06:13:19,020
be shifted out of frame
when he has a spasm,

8214
06:13:19,020 --> 06:13:20,520
or if he has something in his mouth,

8215
06:13:20,520 --> 06:13:23,189
it'll stab him in the face
if he spasms too hard.

8216
06:13:23,189 --> 06:13:24,869
So these kind of
considerations are important

8217
06:13:24,869 --> 06:13:26,399
when thinking about what advantages

8218
06:13:26,400 --> 06:13:27,659
a BCI has in someone's life.

8219
06:13:27,659 --> 06:13:29,615
If it fits ergonomically into your life

8220
06:13:29,616 --> 06:13:31,560
in a way that you can use it independently

8221
06:13:31,560 --> 06:13:33,930
when your caretaker's not
there, wherever you want to,

8222
06:13:33,930 --> 06:13:35,189
either in the bed or in the chair,

8223
06:13:35,189 --> 06:13:37,139
depending on your comfort level

8224
06:13:37,139 --> 06:13:39,329
and your desire to have pressure sores,

8225
06:13:39,330 --> 06:13:40,800
all these factors matter a lot

8226
06:13:40,799 --> 06:13:45,329
in how good the solution
is in that user's life.

8227
06:13:45,330 --> 06:13:48,000
So one of these very
fun examples is scroll.

8228
06:13:48,000 --> 06:13:50,729
So again, manga is something
he wanted to be able to read,

8229
06:13:50,729 --> 06:13:55,371
and there's many ways
to do scroll with a BCI.

8230
06:13:55,371 --> 06:13:57,509
You can imagine like different
gestures, for example.

8231
06:13:57,509 --> 06:14:00,299
The user could do that,
would move the page.

8232
06:14:00,299 --> 06:14:02,819
But scroll is a very
fascinating control surface,

8233
06:14:02,819 --> 06:14:06,150
because it's a huge thing on
the screen in front of you.

8234
06:14:06,150 --> 06:14:08,010
So any sort of jitter in the model output,

8235
06:14:08,009 --> 06:14:09,269
any sort of error in the model output

8236
06:14:09,270 --> 06:14:11,400
causes like an earthquake on the screen.

8237
06:14:11,400 --> 06:14:12,870
Like you really don't
wanna have your manga page

8238
06:14:12,869 --> 06:14:15,599
you're trying to read be
shifted up and down a few pixels

8239
06:14:15,599 --> 06:14:19,649
just because your scroll decoder
is not completely accurate.

8240
06:14:19,650 --> 06:14:23,130
And so this was an example
where we had to figure out

8241
06:14:23,130 --> 06:14:24,780
how to formulate the problem in a way

8242
06:14:24,779 --> 06:14:27,149
that the errors of the system,
whenever they do occur,

8243
06:14:27,150 --> 06:14:28,770
and we'll do our best to minimize them,

8244
06:14:28,770 --> 06:14:30,330
whenever those errors do occur,

8245
06:14:30,330 --> 06:14:32,460
that it doesn't interrupt the qualia again

8246
06:14:32,459 --> 06:14:34,529
of the experience that the user is having.

8247
06:14:34,529 --> 06:14:36,719
It doesn't interrupt their
flow of reading their book.

8248
06:14:36,720 --> 06:14:37,850
And so what we ended up building

8249
06:14:37,849 --> 06:14:40,919
is this really brilliant feature.

8250
06:14:40,919 --> 06:14:42,509
This is teammate named Ruse,

8251
06:14:42,509 --> 06:14:44,399
who worked on this really brilliant work

8252
06:14:44,400 --> 06:14:45,233
called quick scroll.

8253
06:14:45,233 --> 06:14:47,580
And quick scroll basically
looks at the screen,

8254
06:14:47,580 --> 06:14:50,940
and it identifies where on
the screen are scroll bars.

8255
06:14:50,939 --> 06:14:52,729
And it does this by deeply
integrated with MacOs

8256
06:14:52,729 --> 06:14:56,159
to understand where are the
scroll bars actively present

8257
06:14:56,159 --> 06:14:58,020
on the screen using the
sort of accessibility tool

8258
06:14:58,020 --> 06:15:00,659
that's available to MacOs apps.

8259
06:15:00,659 --> 06:15:03,008
And we identified where
those scroll bars are

8260
06:15:03,008 --> 06:15:05,099
and we provided a BCI scroll bar.

8261
06:15:05,099 --> 06:15:08,039
And the BCI scroll bar looks
similar to a normal scroll bar

8262
06:15:08,040 --> 06:15:09,120
but it behaves very differently

8263
06:15:09,119 --> 06:15:11,009
in that once you sort of move over to it,

8264
06:15:11,009 --> 06:15:12,779
your cursor sort of morphs onto it.

8265
06:15:12,779 --> 06:15:14,789
It sort of attaches or latches onto it.

8266
06:15:14,790 --> 06:15:16,397
And then once you push up or down

8267
06:15:16,397 --> 06:15:19,560
in the same way that you'd
use a push to control

8268
06:15:19,560 --> 06:15:22,830
the normal cursor, it actually
moves the screen for you.

8269
06:15:22,830 --> 06:15:24,600
So it's basically like
remapping the velocity

8270
06:15:24,599 --> 06:15:26,489
to a scroll action.

8271
06:15:26,490 --> 06:15:29,159
And the reason that feels so
natural and intuitive is that,

8272
06:15:29,159 --> 06:15:31,349
when you move over to attach
to it, it feels like magnetic.

8273
06:15:31,349 --> 06:15:32,336
So you're like sort of stuck onto it.

8274
06:15:32,336 --> 06:15:33,959
And then it's one continuous action.

8275
06:15:33,959 --> 06:15:36,029
You don't have to like switch
your imagined movement.

8276
06:15:36,029 --> 06:15:37,826
You sort of snap onto it
and then you're good to go.

8277
06:15:37,827 --> 06:15:39,420
You just immediately can start pulling

8278
06:15:39,419 --> 06:15:41,189
the page down or pushing it up.

8279
06:15:41,189 --> 06:15:43,049
And even once you get that right,

8280
06:15:43,049 --> 06:15:44,430
there's so many little nuances

8281
06:15:44,430 --> 06:15:46,500
of how the scroll behavior works

8282
06:15:46,500 --> 06:15:47,880
to make it natural and intuitive.

8283
06:15:47,880 --> 06:15:49,680
So one example is momentum.

8284
06:15:49,680 --> 06:15:52,194
Like when you scroll a page
with your fingers on the screen,

8285
06:15:52,194 --> 06:15:54,270
you actually have some like flow.

8286
06:15:54,270 --> 06:15:55,170
Like it doesn't just stop

8287
06:15:55,169 --> 06:15:56,669
right when you lift your finger up.

8288
06:15:56,669 --> 06:15:58,379
The same is true with BCI scroll.

8289
06:15:58,380 --> 06:15:59,909
So we had to spend some time to figure out

8290
06:15:59,909 --> 06:16:00,869
what are the right nuances.

8291
06:16:00,869 --> 06:16:03,329
When you don't feel the screen
under your fingertip anymore,

8292
06:16:03,330 --> 06:16:04,740
what is the right sort of dynamic

8293
06:16:04,740 --> 06:16:08,550
or what's the right amount
of page give, if you will,

8294
06:16:08,549 --> 06:16:10,680
when you push it to make
it flow the right amount

8295
06:16:10,680 --> 06:16:11,849
for the user to have

8296
06:16:11,849 --> 06:16:14,519
a natural experience reading their book.

8297
06:16:14,520 --> 06:16:15,671
And there's a million, I mean,

8298
06:16:15,670 --> 06:16:17,789
I could tell you like there's
so many little minutia

8299
06:16:17,790 --> 06:16:20,850
of how exactly that scroll works
that we spent probably like

8300
06:16:20,849 --> 06:16:24,419
a month getting right to make
that feel extremely natural

8301
06:16:24,419 --> 06:16:25,529
and easy for the user to navigate.

8302
06:16:25,529 --> 06:16:29,250
- I mean, even to scroll on
a smartphone with your finger

8303
06:16:29,250 --> 06:16:32,400
feels extremely natural and pleasant.

8304
06:16:32,400 --> 06:16:37,380
And it probably takes
a extremely long time

8305
06:16:37,380 --> 06:16:38,549
to get that right.

8306
06:16:38,549 --> 06:16:43,290
And actually, the same
kind of visionary UX design

8307
06:16:43,290 --> 06:16:45,840
that we're talking about, don't
always listen to the users

8308
06:16:45,840 --> 06:16:49,170
but also listen to them, and
also have like visionary big,

8309
06:16:49,169 --> 06:16:50,489
like throw everything out,

8310
06:16:50,490 --> 06:16:53,670
think from first principles but also not.

8311
06:16:53,669 --> 06:16:56,159
Yeah, yeah, by the way,
it just makes me think

8312
06:16:56,159 --> 06:16:59,040
that scroll bars on the desktop

8313
06:16:59,040 --> 06:17:02,083
probably have stagnated
and never taken that like,

8314
06:17:02,082 --> 06:17:05,159
'cause the snap, same
as like snap the grid,

8315
06:17:05,159 --> 06:17:07,939
snap the scroll bar action
you're talking about

8316
06:17:07,939 --> 06:17:11,489
is something that could
potentially be extremely useful

8317
06:17:11,490 --> 06:17:13,080
in the desktop setting,

8318
06:17:13,080 --> 06:17:16,067
even just for users to just
improve the experience,

8319
06:17:16,066 --> 06:17:18,110
'cause the current scroll bar experience

8320
06:17:18,110 --> 06:17:20,106
in the desktop is horrible.
- Yeah, agreed.

8321
06:17:20,106 --> 06:17:22,200
- It's hard to find, hard to control.

8322
06:17:22,200 --> 06:17:23,433
There's not a momentum.

8323
06:17:25,020 --> 06:17:26,490
And the intention should be clear.

8324
06:17:26,490 --> 06:17:28,560
When I start moving towards a scroll bar,

8325
06:17:28,560 --> 06:17:31,290
there should be a snapping
to the scroll bar action.

8326
06:17:31,290 --> 06:17:36,120
But of course, maybe I'm
okay paying that cost,

8327
06:17:36,119 --> 06:17:38,639
but there's hundreds of millions of people

8328
06:17:38,639 --> 06:17:39,959
paying that cost nonstop.

8329
06:17:39,959 --> 06:17:42,479
But anyway, but in this case,

8330
06:17:42,479 --> 06:17:46,439
this is necessary because
there's an extra cost

8331
06:17:46,439 --> 06:17:48,509
paid by Noland for the jitteriness.

8332
06:17:48,509 --> 06:17:53,369
So you have to switch between
the scrolling and the reading.

8333
06:17:53,369 --> 06:17:56,129
There has to be a phase
shift between the two.

8334
06:17:56,130 --> 06:17:58,650
Like when you're scrolling,
you're scrolling.

8335
06:17:58,650 --> 06:18:00,300
- Right, right, so that is one drawback

8336
06:18:00,299 --> 06:18:02,040
of the current approach.

8337
06:18:02,040 --> 06:18:04,440
Maybe one other just
sort of case study here,

8338
06:18:04,439 --> 06:18:06,029
so again, UX is how it works,

8339
06:18:06,029 --> 06:18:08,369
and we think about that
holistically from like the,

8340
06:18:08,369 --> 06:18:09,479
even the feature detection level

8341
06:18:09,479 --> 06:18:11,729
of what we detect in the brain
to how we design the decoder,

8342
06:18:11,729 --> 06:18:13,799
what we choose to decode,
to then how it works

8343
06:18:13,799 --> 06:18:15,090
once it's being used by the user.

8344
06:18:15,090 --> 06:18:16,709
So another good example in
the sort of how it works

8345
06:18:16,709 --> 06:18:19,409
once they're actually using the decoder,

8346
06:18:19,409 --> 06:18:20,610
the output that's displayed on the screen

8347
06:18:20,610 --> 06:18:22,080
is not just what the decoder says.

8348
06:18:22,080 --> 06:18:25,080
It's also a function of
what's going on on the screen.

8349
06:18:25,080 --> 06:18:26,430
So we can understand, for example,

8350
06:18:26,430 --> 06:18:28,979
that when you're trying to close a tab,

8351
06:18:28,979 --> 06:18:32,009
that very small, stupid little
X that's extremely tiny,

8352
06:18:32,009 --> 06:18:34,289
which is hard to get precisely hit

8353
06:18:34,290 --> 06:18:35,639
if you're dealing with sort of a noisy

8354
06:18:35,639 --> 06:18:37,319
output of the decoder, we can understand

8355
06:18:37,319 --> 06:18:39,239
that that is a small little
X you might be trying to hit

8356
06:18:39,240 --> 06:18:40,980
and actually make it a
bigger target for you.

8357
06:18:40,979 --> 06:18:42,930
Similar to how when you're
typing on your phone,

8358
06:18:42,930 --> 06:18:46,439
if you are used to like the
iOS keyboard, for example,

8359
06:18:46,439 --> 06:18:47,939
it actually adapts the target size

8360
06:18:47,939 --> 06:18:50,430
of individual keys based on
an underlying language model.

8361
06:18:50,430 --> 06:18:52,296
So it'll actually
understand if I'm typing,

8362
06:18:52,296 --> 06:18:54,266
"Hey, I'm going to see L."

8363
06:18:55,290 --> 06:18:56,250
It'll make the E key bigger,

8364
06:18:56,250 --> 06:18:58,409
because in those Lex is the
person I'm gonna go see.

8365
06:18:58,409 --> 06:19:01,259
And so that kind of predictiveness
can make the experience

8366
06:19:01,259 --> 06:19:03,179
much more smooth even without

8367
06:19:03,180 --> 06:19:04,847
improvements to the underlying decoder

8368
06:19:04,847 --> 06:19:07,830
or feature detection part of the stack.

8369
06:19:07,830 --> 06:19:09,510
So we do that with a feature
called magnetic targets.

8370
06:19:09,509 --> 06:19:11,549
We actually indexed the
screen and we understand,

8371
06:19:11,549 --> 06:19:13,422
okay, these are the places
that are very small targets

8372
06:19:13,422 --> 06:19:15,389
that might be difficult to hit.

8373
06:19:15,389 --> 06:19:17,729
Here's the kind of cursor
dynamics around that location

8374
06:19:17,729 --> 06:19:19,860
that might be indicative of
the user trying to select it.

8375
06:19:19,860 --> 06:19:20,850
Let's make it easier.

8376
06:19:20,849 --> 06:19:22,169
Let's blow up the size of it in a way

8377
06:19:22,169 --> 06:19:23,129
that makes it easier for the user

8378
06:19:23,130 --> 06:19:24,680
to sort of snap onto that target.

8379
06:19:24,680 --> 06:19:26,250
So all these little
details, they matter a lot

8380
06:19:26,250 --> 06:19:27,569
in helping the user be independent

8381
06:19:27,569 --> 06:19:29,130
in their day-to-day living.

8382
06:19:29,130 --> 06:19:31,409
- So how much of the work on the decoder

8383
06:19:31,409 --> 06:19:34,652
is generalizable to P2, P3, P4, P5, PM?

8384
06:19:36,750 --> 06:19:38,340
How do you improve the decoder

8385
06:19:38,340 --> 06:19:40,920
in a way that's generalizable?

8386
06:19:40,919 --> 06:19:41,819
- Yeah, great question.

8387
06:19:41,819 --> 06:19:44,340
So the underlying signal
we're trying to decode

8388
06:19:44,340 --> 06:19:46,139
is gonna look very
different in P2 than in P1.

8389
06:19:46,139 --> 06:19:49,259
For example, channel
number 345 is gonna mean

8390
06:19:49,259 --> 06:19:51,449
something different in user
one than it will in user two,

8391
06:19:51,450 --> 06:19:52,950
just because that
electrode that corresponds

8392
06:19:52,950 --> 06:19:55,590
with channel 345 is gonna be
next to a different neuron

8393
06:19:55,590 --> 06:19:57,689
in user one versus user two.

8394
06:19:57,689 --> 06:19:59,279
But the approach is the methods,

8395
06:19:59,279 --> 06:20:01,349
the user experience of
how do you get the right

8396
06:20:01,349 --> 06:20:03,299
sort of behavioral pattern from the user

8397
06:20:03,299 --> 06:20:04,770
to associate with that neural signal,

8398
06:20:04,770 --> 06:20:06,180
we hope that will translate

8399
06:20:06,180 --> 06:20:08,400
over multiple generations of users.

8400
06:20:08,400 --> 06:20:09,990
And beyond that, it's very, very possible.

8401
06:20:09,990 --> 06:20:10,950
In fact, quite likely that we've overfit

8402
06:20:10,950 --> 06:20:14,819
to sort of Noland's user
experience desires and preferences.

8403
06:20:14,819 --> 06:20:17,220
And so what I hope to see is that

8404
06:20:17,220 --> 06:20:19,680
when we get second,
third, fourth participant,

8405
06:20:19,680 --> 06:20:22,020
that we find sort of what
the right wide minimums are

8406
06:20:22,020 --> 06:20:23,189
that cover all the cases,

8407
06:20:23,189 --> 06:20:24,419
that make it more intuitive for everyone.

8408
06:20:24,419 --> 06:20:26,436
And hopefully, there's a
crosspollination of things where,

8409
06:20:26,437 --> 06:20:28,080
"Oh, we didn't think
about that with this user,

8410
06:20:28,080 --> 06:20:30,087
because they can speak.

8411
06:20:30,086 --> 06:20:31,950
But with this user who
just can fundamentally

8412
06:20:31,950 --> 06:20:34,740
not speak at all, this user
experience is not optimal."

8413
06:20:34,740 --> 06:20:35,573
And that will actually,

8414
06:20:35,573 --> 06:20:36,959
those improvements that we make there

8415
06:20:36,959 --> 06:20:37,792
should hopefully translate then

8416
06:20:37,793 --> 06:20:38,819
to even people who can't speak

8417
06:20:38,819 --> 06:20:40,319
but don't feel comfortable doing so

8418
06:20:40,319 --> 06:20:41,250
because we're in a public setting,

8419
06:20:41,250 --> 06:20:42,689
like their doctor's office.

8420
06:20:42,689 --> 06:20:46,829
- So the actual mechanism
of open loop labeling

8421
06:20:46,830 --> 06:20:49,770
and then closed loop
labeling will be the same,

8422
06:20:49,770 --> 06:20:52,830
and hopefully, can generalize
across the different users

8423
06:20:52,830 --> 06:20:54,730
as they're doing the calibration step.

8424
06:20:56,639 --> 06:20:58,702
And the calibration step is pretty cool.

8425
06:20:58,703 --> 06:21:00,540
I mean, that in itself,

8426
06:21:00,540 --> 06:21:02,340
the interesting thing about Webgrid,

8427
06:21:02,340 --> 06:21:05,459
which is like closed loop, it's like fun.

8428
06:21:05,459 --> 06:21:07,202
I love it when there's like,

8429
06:21:08,040 --> 06:21:10,530
they used to be kind of
idea of human computation,

8430
06:21:10,529 --> 06:21:13,919
which is using actions a
human would want to do anyway

8431
06:21:13,919 --> 06:21:15,449
to get a lot of signal from.

8432
06:21:15,450 --> 06:21:16,920
- Yeah.
- And like Webgrid is that,

8433
06:21:16,919 --> 06:21:18,854
like a nice video game that also serves

8434
06:21:18,854 --> 06:21:20,042
as great calibration.

8435
06:21:20,043 --> 06:21:21,450
- It's so funny.

8436
06:21:21,450 --> 06:21:22,979
I've heard this reaction so many times.

8437
06:21:22,979 --> 06:21:26,520
Before sort of the first
user was implanted,

8438
06:21:26,520 --> 06:21:28,380
we had an internal perception

8439
06:21:28,380 --> 06:21:30,120
that the first user
would not find this fun.

8440
06:21:30,119 --> 06:21:32,159
And so we thought really quite
a bit actually about like,

8441
06:21:32,159 --> 06:21:33,329
should we build other games

8442
06:21:33,330 --> 06:21:35,700
that like are more
interesting for the user

8443
06:21:35,700 --> 06:21:36,869
so we can get this kind of data

8444
06:21:36,869 --> 06:21:38,289
and help facilitate research

8445
06:21:39,150 --> 06:21:40,319
for long duration and stuff like this?

8446
06:21:40,319 --> 06:21:41,909
Turns out that like people love this game.

8447
06:21:41,909 --> 06:21:42,930
- Yeah.
- I always loved it,

8448
06:21:42,930 --> 06:21:45,779
but I didn't know that that
was a shared perception.

8449
06:21:45,779 --> 06:21:49,469
- Yeah, and just in case
it's not clear, Webgrid is,

8450
06:21:49,470 --> 06:21:54,470
there's a grid of, let's
say 35 by 35 cells,

8451
06:21:55,080 --> 06:21:56,400
and one of them lights up blue

8452
06:21:56,400 --> 06:21:58,860
and you have to move your mouse
over that and click on it.

8453
06:21:58,860 --> 06:22:01,350
And if you miss it and it's red-

8454
06:22:01,349 --> 06:22:03,393
- [Bliss] I played this
game for so many hours.

8455
06:22:03,393 --> 06:22:04,349
So many hours.

8456
06:22:04,349 --> 06:22:06,840
- And what's your record, you said?

8457
06:22:06,840 --> 06:22:07,810
- I think I have the highest at Neuralink.

8458
06:22:07,810 --> 06:22:09,930
Right now, my record's 17 BPS.

8459
06:22:09,930 --> 06:22:11,117
- 17 BPS.
- Which is about,

8460
06:22:11,116 --> 06:22:13,109
if you imagine that 35 by 35 grid,

8461
06:22:13,110 --> 06:22:15,990
you're hitting about 100
trials per minute in.

8462
06:22:15,990 --> 06:22:18,480
So 100 correct selections
in that one minute window.

8463
06:22:18,479 --> 06:22:19,709
So you're averaging about,

8464
06:22:19,709 --> 06:22:21,959
between 500, 600
milliseconds per selection.

8465
06:22:21,959 --> 06:22:25,110
- So one of the reasons
that I think I struggle

8466
06:22:25,110 --> 06:22:27,000
with that game is I'm
such a keyboard person,

8467
06:22:27,000 --> 06:22:29,700
so everything is done with via keyboard.

8468
06:22:29,700 --> 06:22:33,150
If I can avoid touching
the mouse, it's great.

8469
06:22:33,150 --> 06:22:36,270
So how can you explain
your high performance?

8470
06:22:36,270 --> 06:22:37,740
- I have like a whole ritual I go through

8471
06:22:37,740 --> 06:22:38,573
when I play Webgrid.

8472
06:22:38,573 --> 06:22:41,159
So it's actually like a diet
plan associated with this.

8473
06:22:41,159 --> 06:22:43,110
Like it's a whole thing, so great.

8474
06:22:43,110 --> 06:22:44,279
- The first thing-
- You have to fast

8475
06:22:44,279 --> 06:22:46,226
for five days, have to
go up to the mountains.

8476
06:22:46,226 --> 06:22:47,059
- Actually, it kind of,

8477
06:22:47,060 --> 06:22:48,533
I mean, the fasting thing is important.

8478
06:22:48,532 --> 06:22:49,629
So this is like, you know-

8479
06:22:49,629 --> 06:22:51,388
- Focuses the mind, yeah?
- Yeah, it's true.

8480
06:22:51,388 --> 06:22:52,992
So what I do is actually,

8481
06:22:52,992 --> 06:22:55,439
I don't eat for a little bit beforehand.

8482
06:22:55,439 --> 06:22:57,270
And then I'll actually eat
like a ton of peanut butter

8483
06:22:57,270 --> 06:22:58,650
right before, and I get like-

8484
06:22:58,650 --> 06:23:00,691
- This is a real thing?
- This is a real thing, yeah.

8485
06:23:00,690 --> 06:23:02,129
And then it has to be
really late at night.

8486
06:23:02,130 --> 06:23:03,990
This is again a night owl
thing I think we share,

8487
06:23:03,990 --> 06:23:07,290
but it has to be like midnight,
2:00 AM kind of time window.

8488
06:23:07,290 --> 06:23:08,670
And I have a very specific

8489
06:23:08,669 --> 06:23:10,409
like physical position I'll sit in,

8490
06:23:10,409 --> 06:23:12,616
which is, I used to be, I
was homeschooled growing up

8491
06:23:12,616 --> 06:23:15,239
and so I did most of my
work like on the floor,

8492
06:23:15,240 --> 06:23:16,770
just like in my bedroom or whatever.

8493
06:23:16,770 --> 06:23:19,022
And so I have a very specific
situation on the floor.

8494
06:23:19,022 --> 06:23:21,299
On the floor, I sit and play,

8495
06:23:21,299 --> 06:23:22,139
and then you have to make sure

8496
06:23:22,139 --> 06:23:23,639
like there's not a lot
of weight on your elbow

8497
06:23:23,639 --> 06:23:25,409
when you're playing so
that you can move quickly.

8498
06:23:25,409 --> 06:23:26,790
And then I turn the gain of the cursor,

8499
06:23:26,790 --> 06:23:28,097
so the speed of the cursor way, way up.

8500
06:23:28,097 --> 06:23:29,970
So it's like small motions
that actually move the cursor.

8501
06:23:29,970 --> 06:23:31,539
- Are you moving with your wrist

8502
06:23:31,539 --> 06:23:32,371
or you're never moving on-

8503
06:23:32,371 --> 06:23:33,950
- I move my fingers.

8504
06:23:33,950 --> 06:23:35,549
So my wrist is almost completely still.

8505
06:23:35,549 --> 06:23:37,139
I'm just moving my fingers.

8506
06:23:37,139 --> 06:23:37,972
- Yeah.

8507
06:23:37,973 --> 06:23:40,650
You know those, just on a small tangent,

8508
06:23:40,650 --> 06:23:43,650
which I've been meaning to
go down this rabbit hole

8509
06:23:43,650 --> 06:23:47,280
of people that set the
world record in Tetris.

8510
06:23:47,279 --> 06:23:48,299
Those folks, they're playing,

8511
06:23:48,299 --> 06:23:50,469
there's a way to, did you see this?

8512
06:23:50,469 --> 06:23:52,409
- I see like the three, like
all the fingers are moving.

8513
06:23:52,409 --> 06:23:55,546
- Yeah, you could find a way to do it

8514
06:23:55,546 --> 06:23:58,229
where like it's using a loophole,

8515
06:23:58,229 --> 06:24:01,259
like a bug that you can do
some incredibly fast stuff.

8516
06:24:01,259 --> 06:24:03,922
So it's along that line but not quite.

8517
06:24:03,922 --> 06:24:06,599
But you do realize there'll
be like a few programmers

8518
06:24:06,599 --> 06:24:09,059
right now listening to this
cool fast and eat peanut butter

8519
06:24:09,060 --> 06:24:09,893
and be like-
- Yeah, please, please

8520
06:24:09,893 --> 06:24:10,725
trade my record.

8521
06:24:10,725 --> 06:24:12,029
I mean, the reason I did this, literally,

8522
06:24:12,029 --> 06:24:14,069
was just because I wanted
the bar to be high.

8523
06:24:14,069 --> 06:24:16,470
The team, like I wanted
the number that we aim for

8524
06:24:16,470 --> 06:24:17,819
should not be like the median performance.

8525
06:24:17,819 --> 06:24:19,266
It should be able to
beat all of us at least.

8526
06:24:19,266 --> 06:24:21,360
Like that should be the minimum bar.

8527
06:24:21,360 --> 06:24:22,319
- What do you think is possible,

8528
06:24:22,319 --> 06:24:23,549
like 20 scrapes?
- Yeah, I don't know

8529
06:24:23,549 --> 06:24:24,382
what the limits.

8530
06:24:24,383 --> 06:24:25,740
I mean, the limits you can calculate

8531
06:24:25,740 --> 06:24:28,050
just in terms of like screen refresh rate

8532
06:24:28,049 --> 06:24:31,020
and like cursor immediately
jumping to the next target.

8533
06:24:31,020 --> 06:24:32,850
But I mean, I'm sure
there's limits before that

8534
06:24:32,849 --> 06:24:33,836
with just sort of reaction time

8535
06:24:33,836 --> 06:24:36,113
and visual perception
and things like this.

8536
06:24:36,113 --> 06:24:39,690
I would guess it's in the
below 40 but above 20,

8537
06:24:39,689 --> 06:24:41,430
somewhere in there is probably the right

8538
06:24:41,430 --> 06:24:42,540
that I'd never be thinking about.

8539
06:24:42,540 --> 06:24:44,100
It also matters like how
difficult the task is.

8540
06:24:44,099 --> 06:24:46,469
You could imagine like
some people might be able

8541
06:24:46,470 --> 06:24:48,180
to do like 10,000 targets on the screen

8542
06:24:48,180 --> 06:24:50,080
and maybe they can do better that way.

8543
06:24:51,299 --> 06:24:52,829
There's some like task optimizations

8544
06:24:52,830 --> 06:24:55,470
you could do to try to boost
your performance as well.

8545
06:24:55,470 --> 06:24:57,870
- What do you think it takes for Noland

8546
06:24:57,869 --> 06:25:00,239
to be able to do above 8.5?

8547
06:25:00,240 --> 06:25:01,560
To keep increasing that number?

8548
06:25:01,560 --> 06:25:04,470
You said like every increase in the number

8549
06:25:04,470 --> 06:25:05,940
might require different-

8550
06:25:05,939 --> 06:25:06,772
- [Bliss] Yeah.

8551
06:25:06,773 --> 06:25:08,819
- Different improvements in the system.

8552
06:25:08,819 --> 06:25:10,745
- Yeah, I think the
nature of this work is,

8553
06:25:10,745 --> 06:25:12,282
I mean, the first answer
that's important to say is,

8554
06:25:12,282 --> 06:25:13,559
I don't know.

8555
06:25:13,560 --> 06:25:15,600
This is edge of the research.

8556
06:25:15,599 --> 06:25:18,599
So again, nobody's gotten
to that number before.

8557
06:25:18,599 --> 06:25:22,682
So what's next is gonna be a
heuristic guess from my part.

8558
06:25:24,659 --> 06:25:26,610
What we've seen historically
is that different

8559
06:25:26,610 --> 06:25:28,560
parts of the stack follow
next to different time points.

8560
06:25:28,560 --> 06:25:30,243
So when I first joined Neuralink,

8561
06:25:30,242 --> 06:25:31,649
like three years ago or so,

8562
06:25:31,650 --> 06:25:33,480
one of the major problems
was just the latency

8563
06:25:33,479 --> 06:25:34,319
of the Bluetooth connection.

8564
06:25:34,319 --> 06:25:36,779
It was just like the radial
device wasn't super good.

8565
06:25:36,779 --> 06:25:38,639
It was an early revision of the implant,

8566
06:25:38,639 --> 06:25:41,040
and it just like, no matter
how good your decoder was,

8567
06:25:41,040 --> 06:25:42,900
if your thing is updating
every 30 milliseconds

8568
06:25:42,900 --> 06:25:45,000
or 50 milliseconds, it's
just gonna be choppy.

8569
06:25:45,000 --> 06:25:46,709
And no matter how good you are,

8570
06:25:46,709 --> 06:25:49,379
that's gonna be frustrating
and lead to challenges.

8571
06:25:49,380 --> 06:25:51,870
So at that point, it was very
clear that the main challenge

8572
06:25:51,869 --> 06:25:55,680
is just get the data off the
device in a very reliable way,

8573
06:25:55,680 --> 06:25:59,430
such that you can enable the
next challenge to be tackled.

8574
06:25:59,430 --> 06:26:00,992
And then at some point, it was,

8575
06:26:03,060 --> 06:26:03,893
actually, the modeling challenge

8576
06:26:03,893 --> 06:26:06,689
of how do you just build a good mapping,

8577
06:26:06,689 --> 06:26:08,129
like the supervised learning problem

8578
06:26:08,130 --> 06:26:09,027
of you have a bunch of data

8579
06:26:09,026 --> 06:26:11,459
and you have a label
you're trying to predict,

8580
06:26:11,459 --> 06:26:14,099
just what is the right like
neuro decoder architecture

8581
06:26:14,099 --> 06:26:15,537
and hyper parameters to optimize that?

8582
06:26:15,537 --> 06:26:16,770
And that was a problem for a bit.

8583
06:26:16,770 --> 06:26:19,560
And once you solve that, it
became a different bottleneck.

8584
06:26:19,560 --> 06:26:21,420
I think the next bottleneck
after that was actually

8585
06:26:21,419 --> 06:26:24,359
just sort of software
stability and reliability.

8586
06:26:24,360 --> 06:26:27,670
If you have widely varying
sort of inference latency

8587
06:26:29,639 --> 06:26:32,729
in your system, or your app just lags out

8588
06:26:32,729 --> 06:26:34,979
every once in a while, it
decreases your ability to maintain

8589
06:26:34,979 --> 06:26:35,939
and get in a state of flow,

8590
06:26:35,939 --> 06:26:38,340
and it basically just disrupts
your control experience.

8591
06:26:38,340 --> 06:26:40,259
And so there's a variety
of different software bugs

8592
06:26:40,259 --> 06:26:42,599
and improvements we made
that basically increased

8593
06:26:42,599 --> 06:26:43,799
the performance of the system,

8594
06:26:43,799 --> 06:26:45,959
made it much more
reliable, much more stable,

8595
06:26:45,959 --> 06:26:48,329
and led to a state where we
could reliably collect data

8596
06:26:48,330 --> 06:26:49,650
to build better models with.

8597
06:26:49,650 --> 06:26:50,700
So that was a bottleneck for a while.

8598
06:26:50,700 --> 06:26:53,369
It's just sort of like
the software stack itself.

8599
06:26:53,369 --> 06:26:55,202
If I were to guess right now,

8600
06:26:56,159 --> 06:26:57,659
there's sort of two major directions

8601
06:26:57,659 --> 06:27:00,240
you could think about for
improving BPS further.

8602
06:27:00,240 --> 06:27:01,740
The first major direction is labeling.

8603
06:27:01,740 --> 06:27:03,510
So labeling is again this
fundamental challenge

8604
06:27:03,509 --> 06:27:06,719
of given a window of time where the user

8605
06:27:06,720 --> 06:27:08,700
is expressing some behavioral intent.

8606
06:27:08,700 --> 06:27:10,350
What are they really trying to do

8607
06:27:10,349 --> 06:27:12,869
at the granularity of every millisecond?

8608
06:27:12,869 --> 06:27:14,939
And that, again, is a task design problem.

8609
06:27:14,939 --> 06:27:15,772
It's a UX problem.

8610
06:27:15,773 --> 06:27:17,086
It's a machine learning problem.

8611
06:27:17,086 --> 06:27:19,200
It's a software problem.

8612
06:27:19,200 --> 06:27:21,000
Sort of touches all
those different domains.

8613
06:27:21,000 --> 06:27:22,830
The second thing you can think about

8614
06:27:22,830 --> 06:27:25,920
to improve BPS further is
either completely changing

8615
06:27:25,919 --> 06:27:27,659
the thing you're decoding
or just extending

8616
06:27:27,659 --> 06:27:29,220
the number of things that you're decoding.

8617
06:27:29,220 --> 06:27:30,823
So this is serving the direction
of functionality, okay?

8618
06:27:30,823 --> 06:27:33,000
So you can imagine giving more clicks.

8619
06:27:33,000 --> 06:27:35,520
For example, a left click, a
right click, a middle click.

8620
06:27:35,520 --> 06:27:37,185
Different actions like
click and drag, for example.

8621
06:27:37,185 --> 06:27:38,790
And that can improve the effective

8622
06:27:38,790 --> 06:27:40,590
bit rate of your communication prosthesis.

8623
06:27:40,590 --> 06:27:43,470
If you're trying to allow the
user to express themselves

8624
06:27:43,470 --> 06:27:45,090
through any given communication channel,

8625
06:27:45,090 --> 06:27:46,830
you can measure that with bits per second.

8626
06:27:46,830 --> 06:27:48,240
But what action measures
at the end of the day

8627
06:27:48,240 --> 06:27:51,030
is how effective are they at
navigating their computer.

8628
06:27:51,029 --> 06:27:52,199
And so from the perspective
of the downstream tasks

8629
06:27:52,200 --> 06:27:54,090
that you care about, functionality

8630
06:27:54,090 --> 06:27:54,922
and extending functionality is something

8631
06:27:54,922 --> 06:27:56,879
we're very interested in,
because not only can it improve

8632
06:27:56,880 --> 06:27:59,040
the sort of number of BPS,

8633
06:27:59,040 --> 06:28:00,600
but it can also improve the downstream

8634
06:28:00,599 --> 06:28:02,129
sort of independence that the user has

8635
06:28:02,130 --> 06:28:02,970
and the skill and efficiency

8636
06:28:02,970 --> 06:28:05,370
with which they can
operate their computer.

8637
06:28:05,369 --> 06:28:08,579
- Would the number of threads increasing

8638
06:28:08,580 --> 06:28:10,710
also potentially help?

8639
06:28:10,709 --> 06:28:12,479
- Yes, short answer is yes.

8640
06:28:12,479 --> 06:28:14,500
It's a bit nuanced how that curve

8641
06:28:15,540 --> 06:28:19,110
or how that manifests in the numbers.

8642
06:28:19,110 --> 06:28:21,840
So what you'll see is
that if you sort of plot

8643
06:28:21,840 --> 06:28:24,689
a curve of number of channels

8644
06:28:24,689 --> 06:28:26,099
that you're using for decode

8645
06:28:26,099 --> 06:28:27,779
versus either the offline metric

8646
06:28:27,779 --> 06:28:29,789
of how good you are at decoding,

8647
06:28:29,790 --> 06:28:32,400
or the online metric of
sort of, in practice,

8648
06:28:32,400 --> 06:28:34,620
how good is the user using this device,

8649
06:28:34,619 --> 06:28:36,209
you see roughly a log curve.

8650
06:28:36,209 --> 06:28:39,569
So as you move further
out in number of channels,

8651
06:28:39,569 --> 06:28:41,659
you get a corresponding sort
of logarithmic improvement

8652
06:28:41,659 --> 06:28:44,433
in control quality and
offline validation metrics.

8653
06:28:45,360 --> 06:28:49,020
The important nuance
here is that each channel

8654
06:28:49,020 --> 06:28:50,560
corresponds with a specific

8655
06:28:51,509 --> 06:28:53,279
represented intention in the brain.

8656
06:28:53,279 --> 06:28:55,819
So for example, if you have a channel 254,

8657
06:28:55,819 --> 06:28:57,630
it might correspond with
moving to the right.

8658
06:28:57,630 --> 06:29:00,330
Channel 256 might mean move to the left.

8659
06:29:00,330 --> 06:29:02,610
If you want to expand
the number of functions

8660
06:29:02,610 --> 06:29:05,953
you want to control,
you really want to have

8661
06:29:05,953 --> 06:29:07,170
a broader set of channels

8662
06:29:07,169 --> 06:29:09,059
that covers a broader set
of imagined movements.

8663
06:29:09,060 --> 06:29:11,580
You can think of it kinda
like Mr. Potato man actually.

8664
06:29:11,580 --> 06:29:13,140
Like if you had a bunch of different

8665
06:29:13,139 --> 06:29:14,579
imagined movements you could do,

8666
06:29:14,580 --> 06:29:15,990
how would you map those imagined movements

8667
06:29:15,990 --> 06:29:17,909
to input to a computer?

8668
06:29:17,909 --> 06:29:19,229
You can imagine handwriting

8669
06:29:19,229 --> 06:29:20,459
to output characters on the screen.

8670
06:29:20,459 --> 06:29:21,930
You can imagine just
typing with your fingers

8671
06:29:21,930 --> 06:29:23,549
and have that output text on the screen.

8672
06:29:23,549 --> 06:29:24,382
You can imagine different finger

8673
06:29:24,383 --> 06:29:25,560
modulations for different clicks.

8674
06:29:25,560 --> 06:29:26,790
You can imagine wiggling your big nose

8675
06:29:26,790 --> 06:29:30,720
or opening some menu or
wiggling your big toe

8676
06:29:30,720 --> 06:29:33,780
to have like command tab
occur or something like this.

8677
06:29:33,779 --> 06:29:35,309
So it's really,

8678
06:29:35,310 --> 06:29:37,650
the amount of different actions
you can take in the world

8679
06:29:37,650 --> 06:29:38,970
depends on how many channels you have

8680
06:29:38,970 --> 06:29:40,943
on the information
content that they carry.

8681
06:29:42,119 --> 06:29:44,250
- Right, so that's more
about the number of actions.

8682
06:29:44,250 --> 06:29:46,770
So actually, as you increase
the number of threads,

8683
06:29:46,770 --> 06:29:50,130
that's more about increasing

8684
06:29:50,130 --> 06:29:51,990
the number of actions
you're able to perform.

8685
06:29:51,990 --> 06:29:53,790
- One other nuance there
that is worth mentioning,

8686
06:29:53,790 --> 06:29:56,010
so again, our goal is really
to enable a user with process

8687
06:29:56,009 --> 06:29:57,439
to control their computer
as fast as I can.

8688
06:29:57,439 --> 06:29:58,592
So that's BPS.

8689
06:29:59,430 --> 06:30:00,930
With all the same functionality I have,

8690
06:30:00,930 --> 06:30:01,860
which is what we just talked about,

8691
06:30:01,860 --> 06:30:03,897
but then also as reliably as I can.

8692
06:30:03,897 --> 06:30:06,569
And that last point is very related

8693
06:30:06,569 --> 06:30:07,650
to channel account discussion.

8694
06:30:07,650 --> 06:30:10,290
So as you scale out number of channels,

8695
06:30:10,290 --> 06:30:12,750
the relative importance
of any particular feature

8696
06:30:12,750 --> 06:30:14,450
of your model input to the output control

8697
06:30:14,450 --> 06:30:16,110
of the user diminishes,

8698
06:30:16,110 --> 06:30:19,080
which means that if the sort
of neural non-stationary effect

8699
06:30:19,080 --> 06:30:22,260
is per channel, or if
the noise is independent,

8700
06:30:22,259 --> 06:30:23,609
such that more channels means,

8701
06:30:23,610 --> 06:30:25,950
on average, less output effect,

8702
06:30:25,950 --> 06:30:28,560
then your reliability of
your system will improve.

8703
06:30:28,560 --> 06:30:30,833
So one sort of core thesis
that at least I have

8704
06:30:30,832 --> 06:30:32,759
is that scaling channel
account should improve

8705
06:30:32,759 --> 06:30:34,769
the reliability system without any work

8706
06:30:34,770 --> 06:30:36,393
on the decoder itself.

8707
06:30:37,319 --> 06:30:40,202
- Can you linger on the reliability here?

8708
06:30:40,202 --> 06:30:41,639
So first of all, when you see

8709
06:30:41,639 --> 06:30:43,559
non-stationarity of the signal,

8710
06:30:43,560 --> 06:30:46,409
which aspect are you referring to?

8711
06:30:46,409 --> 06:30:47,819
- Yeah, so maybe let's talk briefly

8712
06:30:47,819 --> 06:30:49,470
what the actual underlying
signal looks like.

8713
06:30:49,470 --> 06:30:51,510
So again, I spoke very
briefly at the beginning

8714
06:30:51,509 --> 06:30:53,459
about how when you imagine
moving to the right

8715
06:30:53,459 --> 06:30:54,750
or imagine moving to the left,

8716
06:30:54,750 --> 06:30:56,159
neurons might fire more or less.

8717
06:30:56,159 --> 06:30:57,990
And their frequency
content of that signal,

8718
06:30:57,990 --> 06:30:59,010
at least in the motor cortex,

8719
06:30:59,009 --> 06:31:00,986
it's very correlated with
the output intention,

8720
06:31:00,987 --> 06:31:03,780
the behavioral task
that the user is doing.

8721
06:31:03,779 --> 06:31:05,369
You can imagine actually,
this is not obvious,

8722
06:31:05,369 --> 06:31:07,950
that rate coding, which is
the name of that phenomenon

8723
06:31:07,950 --> 06:31:09,510
is like the only way the brain
could represent information.

8724
06:31:09,509 --> 06:31:11,069
You can imagine many different ways

8725
06:31:11,069 --> 06:31:13,290
in which the brain could encode intention.

8726
06:31:13,290 --> 06:31:15,330
And there's actually evidence
like in bats, for example,

8727
06:31:15,330 --> 06:31:16,830
that there's temporal codes.

8728
06:31:16,830 --> 06:31:20,100
So timing codes of like exactly
when particular neurons fire

8729
06:31:20,099 --> 06:31:24,029
is the mechanism of
information representation.

8730
06:31:24,029 --> 06:31:25,049
But at least in the motor cortex,

8731
06:31:25,049 --> 06:31:27,750
there's a substantial evidence
that it's rate coding,

8732
06:31:27,750 --> 06:31:29,540
or at least one, like first order of fact

8733
06:31:29,540 --> 06:31:31,110
is that it's rate coding.

8734
06:31:31,110 --> 06:31:33,630
So then if the brain is
representing information

8735
06:31:33,630 --> 06:31:37,860
by changing the sort of
frequency of a neuron firing,

8736
06:31:37,860 --> 06:31:39,659
what really matters is sort of the delta

8737
06:31:39,659 --> 06:31:41,546
between sort of the
baseline state of the neuron

8738
06:31:41,546 --> 06:31:43,709
and what it looks like
when it's modulated.

8739
06:31:43,709 --> 06:31:45,930
And what we've observed and
what has also been observed

8740
06:31:45,930 --> 06:31:47,939
in academic work is
that that baseline rate,

8741
06:31:47,939 --> 06:31:49,559
sort of the, if you're
to target the scale,

8742
06:31:49,560 --> 06:31:53,010
if you imagine that
analogy for like measuring

8743
06:31:53,009 --> 06:31:54,629
flour or something when you're baking,

8744
06:31:54,630 --> 06:31:57,180
that baseline state of
how much the pot weighs

8745
06:31:57,180 --> 06:31:59,520
is actually different day to day.

8746
06:31:59,520 --> 06:32:00,600
And so if what you're trying to measure

8747
06:32:00,599 --> 06:32:02,159
is how much rice is in the pot,

8748
06:32:02,159 --> 06:32:03,689
you're gonna get a different
measurement different days,

8749
06:32:03,689 --> 06:32:05,309
because you're measuring
with different pots.

8750
06:32:05,310 --> 06:32:08,550
So that baseline rate shifting
is really the thing that,

8751
06:32:08,549 --> 06:32:11,309
at least from a first order
description of the problem,

8752
06:32:11,310 --> 06:32:12,990
is what's causing this downstream bias.

8753
06:32:12,990 --> 06:32:13,890
There can be other effects,

8754
06:32:13,889 --> 06:32:15,029
non-linear effects on top of that,

8755
06:32:15,029 --> 06:32:16,289
but at least, at a very first order

8756
06:32:16,290 --> 06:32:17,610
description of the problem,

8757
06:32:17,610 --> 06:32:18,875
that's what we observe day to day

8758
06:32:18,875 --> 06:32:20,909
is that the baseline firing
rate of any particular

8759
06:32:20,909 --> 06:32:23,610
neuron are observed on a
particular channel is changing.

8760
06:32:23,610 --> 06:32:27,299
- So can you just adjust to the baseline

8761
06:32:27,299 --> 06:32:29,459
to make it relative to
the baseline nonstop?

8762
06:32:29,459 --> 06:32:30,750
- Yeah, this is a great question.

8763
06:32:30,750 --> 06:32:35,462
So with monkeys, we have
found various ways to do this.

8764
06:32:36,419 --> 06:32:38,219
One example way to do this is you ask them

8765
06:32:38,220 --> 06:32:39,960
to do some behavioral task,

8766
06:32:39,959 --> 06:32:41,369
like play the game with a joystick,

8767
06:32:41,369 --> 06:32:43,619
you measure what's going on in the brain,

8768
06:32:43,619 --> 06:32:45,000
you compute some mean

8769
06:32:45,000 --> 06:32:46,830
of what's going on across
all the input features,

8770
06:32:46,830 --> 06:32:47,970
and you subtract it in the input

8771
06:32:47,970 --> 06:32:49,380
when you're doing your BCI session.

8772
06:32:49,380 --> 06:32:50,493
Works super well.

8773
06:32:51,360 --> 06:32:52,192
For whatever reason,

8774
06:32:52,192 --> 06:32:54,989
that doesn't work super well with Noland.

8775
06:32:54,990 --> 06:32:56,670
I actually don't know the full reason why,

8776
06:32:56,669 --> 06:32:58,709
but I can imagine several explanations.

8777
06:32:58,709 --> 06:33:01,200
One such explanation could
be that the context effect

8778
06:33:01,200 --> 06:33:03,112
difference between some open loop task

8779
06:33:03,112 --> 06:33:05,370
and some closed loop task
is much more significant

8780
06:33:05,369 --> 06:33:07,139
with Noland than it is with a monkey.

8781
06:33:07,139 --> 06:33:08,159
Maybe in this open loop task,

8782
06:33:08,159 --> 06:33:10,259
he's watching the Lex Fridman podcast

8783
06:33:10,259 --> 06:33:11,489
while he's doing the task,

8784
06:33:11,490 --> 06:33:13,110
or he's whistling and listening to music

8785
06:33:13,110 --> 06:33:14,909
and talking with his
friend and ask his mom

8786
06:33:14,909 --> 06:33:16,077
what's for dinner while
he's doing this task.

8787
06:33:16,077 --> 06:33:20,370
And so the exact sort
of difference in context

8788
06:33:20,369 --> 06:33:22,409
between those two states
may be much larger,

8789
06:33:22,409 --> 06:33:24,299
and thus lead to a bigger
sort of generalization gap

8790
06:33:24,299 --> 06:33:26,459
between the features
that you're normalizing

8791
06:33:26,459 --> 06:33:27,959
at sort of open loop time

8792
06:33:27,959 --> 06:33:29,879
and what you're trying to
use at close loop time.

8793
06:33:29,880 --> 06:33:30,712
- That's interesting.

8794
06:33:30,712 --> 06:33:33,180
Just on that point,
it's kind of incredible

8795
06:33:33,180 --> 06:33:35,790
to watch Noland be able
to do, to multitask,

8796
06:33:35,790 --> 06:33:37,830
to do multiple tasks at the same time,

8797
06:33:37,830 --> 06:33:40,470
to be able to move the
mouse courser effectively

8798
06:33:40,470 --> 06:33:43,680
while talking and while being nervous,

8799
06:33:43,680 --> 06:33:44,549
because he's talking in front of-

8800
06:33:44,549 --> 06:33:46,079
- Kicking my ass and chest too, yeah.

8801
06:33:46,080 --> 06:33:47,370
- Kicking your ass.

8802
06:33:47,369 --> 06:33:50,219
And talk trash while doing it.

8803
06:33:50,220 --> 06:33:51,720
So all at the same time.

8804
06:33:51,720 --> 06:33:55,440
And yes, if you are trying
to normalize to the baseline,

8805
06:33:55,439 --> 06:33:57,039
that might throw everything off.

8806
06:33:58,470 --> 06:33:59,639
Boy is that interesting.

8807
06:33:59,639 --> 06:34:01,020
- Maybe one comment on that too.

8808
06:34:01,020 --> 06:34:03,441
For folks that aren't familiar
with assisted technology,

8809
06:34:03,441 --> 06:34:04,500
I think there's a common belief

8810
06:34:04,500 --> 06:34:06,450
that, well, why can't you
just use an eye tracker

8811
06:34:06,450 --> 06:34:08,790
or something like this
for helping somebody

8812
06:34:08,790 --> 06:34:09,926
move a mouse on the screen?

8813
06:34:09,926 --> 06:34:11,096
And it's a really a fair question,

8814
06:34:11,097 --> 06:34:13,200
and one that I actually did

8815
06:34:13,200 --> 06:34:15,420
was not confident before Noland,

8816
06:34:15,419 --> 06:34:16,709
that this was gonna be a profoundly

8817
06:34:16,709 --> 06:34:19,409
transformative technology
for people like him.

8818
06:34:19,409 --> 06:34:21,419
And I'm very confident
now that it will be,

8819
06:34:21,419 --> 06:34:22,379
but the reasons are subtle.

8820
06:34:22,380 --> 06:34:23,909
It really has to do with ergonomically

8821
06:34:23,909 --> 06:34:25,439
how it fits into their life.

8822
06:34:25,439 --> 06:34:28,259
Even if you can just offer
the same level of control

8823
06:34:28,259 --> 06:34:29,789
as what they would have
with an eye tracker

8824
06:34:29,790 --> 06:34:31,350
or with a mouse stick,

8825
06:34:31,349 --> 06:34:33,119
but you don't need to have
that thing in your face.

8826
06:34:33,119 --> 06:34:34,829
You don't need to be
positioned a certain way.

8827
06:34:34,830 --> 06:34:35,790
You don't need your caretaker

8828
06:34:35,790 --> 06:34:37,470
to be around to set it up for you.

8829
06:34:37,470 --> 06:34:38,850
You can activate it when you want,

8830
06:34:38,849 --> 06:34:40,349
how you want, wherever you want.

8831
06:34:40,349 --> 06:34:43,709
That level of independence is
so game changing for people.

8832
06:34:43,709 --> 06:34:45,540
It means that they can text
a friend at night privately

8833
06:34:45,540 --> 06:34:47,459
without their mom needing
to be in the loop.

8834
06:34:47,459 --> 06:34:49,619
It means that they can like open up

8835
06:34:49,619 --> 06:34:52,229
and browse the internet at
2:00 AM when nobody's around

8836
06:34:52,229 --> 06:34:54,630
to set their iPad up for them.

8837
06:34:54,630 --> 06:34:57,180
This is like a profoundly
game changing thing

8838
06:34:57,180 --> 06:34:58,409
for folks in that situation.

8839
06:34:58,409 --> 06:35:00,329
And this is even before we
start talking about folks

8840
06:35:00,330 --> 06:35:02,250
that may not be able to communicate at all

8841
06:35:02,250 --> 06:35:03,450
or ask for help when they want to.

8842
06:35:03,450 --> 06:35:05,190
This can be potentially the only link

8843
06:35:05,189 --> 06:35:06,930
that they have to the outside world.

8844
06:35:06,930 --> 06:35:09,090
And yeah, that one doesn't
I think need explanation

8845
06:35:09,090 --> 06:35:11,009
of why that's so impactful.

8846
06:35:11,009 --> 06:35:13,859
- You mentioned neural decoder.

8847
06:35:13,860 --> 06:35:16,139
How much machine learning
is in the decoder?

8848
06:35:16,139 --> 06:35:18,632
How much magic, how much
science, how much art,

8849
06:35:20,130 --> 06:35:22,650
how difficult is it to
come up with a decoder

8850
06:35:22,650 --> 06:35:27,650
that figures out what these
sequence of spikes mean?

8851
06:35:28,529 --> 06:35:29,702
- Yeah, good question.

8852
06:35:30,930 --> 06:35:32,189
There's a couple different
ways to answer this.

8853
06:35:32,189 --> 06:35:34,199
So maybe I'll zoom out briefly first,

8854
06:35:34,200 --> 06:35:35,970
and then I'll go down
one of the rabbit holes.

8855
06:35:35,970 --> 06:35:38,010
So the zoomed out view is that

8856
06:35:38,009 --> 06:35:39,479
building the decoder is really the process

8857
06:35:39,479 --> 06:35:42,540
of building the dataset, plus
compiling it into the weights.

8858
06:35:42,540 --> 06:35:44,523
And each of those steps is important.

8859
06:35:45,360 --> 06:35:46,650
The direction I think
of further improvement

8860
06:35:46,650 --> 06:35:48,260
is primarily going to
be in the dataset side

8861
06:35:48,259 --> 06:35:51,059
of how do you construct the
optimal labels for the model.

8862
06:35:51,060 --> 06:35:52,590
But there's an entirely separate challenge

8863
06:35:52,590 --> 06:35:54,327
of then how do you compile the best model.

8864
06:35:54,327 --> 06:35:55,710
And so I'll go briefly
down the second one,

8865
06:35:55,709 --> 06:35:58,020
down the second rabbit hole.

8866
06:35:58,020 --> 06:36:00,450
One of the main challenges with designing

8867
06:36:00,450 --> 06:36:03,930
the optimal model for BCI
is that offline metrics

8868
06:36:03,930 --> 06:36:06,393
don't necessarily correspond
to online metrics.

8869
06:36:07,229 --> 06:36:08,520
It's fundamentally a control problem.

8870
06:36:08,520 --> 06:36:11,400
The user is trying to control
something on the screen,

8871
06:36:11,400 --> 06:36:15,627
and the exact sort of user
experience of how you output

8872
06:36:15,627 --> 06:36:19,110
the intention impacts
their ability to control.

8873
06:36:19,110 --> 06:36:22,350
So for example, if you just
look at validation loss,

8874
06:36:22,349 --> 06:36:24,869
as predicted by your model,
there can be multiple ways

8875
06:36:24,869 --> 06:36:26,369
to achieve the same validation loss.

8876
06:36:26,369 --> 06:36:29,219
Not all of them are equally
controllable by the end user.

8877
06:36:30,882 --> 06:36:31,715
And it might be as simple as saying,

8878
06:36:31,715 --> 06:36:33,150
"Oh, you could just add
auxiliary loss terms

8879
06:36:33,150 --> 06:36:35,130
that like help you capture the
thing that actually matters."

8880
06:36:35,130 --> 06:36:37,080
But this is a very
complex nuanced process.

8881
06:36:37,080 --> 06:36:40,200
So how you turn the labels into the model

8882
06:36:40,200 --> 06:36:41,850
is more of a nuanced process

8883
06:36:41,849 --> 06:36:44,459
than just like a standard
supervised learning problem.

8884
06:36:44,459 --> 06:36:47,159
One very fascinating anecdote here,

8885
06:36:47,159 --> 06:36:48,689
we've tried many different
sort of neural network

8886
06:36:48,689 --> 06:36:51,059
architectures that translate brain data

8887
06:36:51,060 --> 06:36:54,900
to velocity outputs, for example.

8888
06:36:54,900 --> 06:36:57,600
And one example that's stuck in my brain

8889
06:36:57,599 --> 06:37:00,719
from a couple years ago
now is, at one point,

8890
06:37:00,720 --> 06:37:01,979
we were using just
fully connected networks

8891
06:37:01,979 --> 06:37:03,750
to decode the brain activity.

8892
06:37:03,750 --> 06:37:06,990
We tried A/B test where we were measuring

8893
06:37:06,990 --> 06:37:09,720
the relative performance
in online control sessions

8894
06:37:09,720 --> 06:37:13,147
of sort of 1D convolution
over the input signal.

8895
06:37:13,147 --> 06:37:16,229
So if you imagine per channel,
you have a sliding window

8896
06:37:16,229 --> 06:37:19,256
that's producing some Commvault feature

8897
06:37:19,257 --> 06:37:21,000
for each of those input sequences

8898
06:37:21,000 --> 06:37:22,950
for every single channel simultaneously.

8899
06:37:22,950 --> 06:37:25,020
You can actually get
better validation metrics,

8900
06:37:25,020 --> 06:37:26,700
meaning you're fitting the data better,

8901
06:37:26,700 --> 06:37:28,590
and it's generalizing
better on offline data

8902
06:37:28,590 --> 06:37:30,000
if you use this
convolutional architecture.

8903
06:37:30,000 --> 06:37:30,900
You're reducing parameters.

8904
06:37:30,900 --> 06:37:34,110
It's sort of a standard procedure

8905
06:37:34,110 --> 06:37:35,549
when you're dealing with time series data.

8906
06:37:35,549 --> 06:37:37,590
Now it turns out that when
using that model online,

8907
06:37:37,590 --> 06:37:39,779
the controllability was worse,

8908
06:37:39,779 --> 06:37:42,276
was far worse, even though the
offline metrics were better.

8909
06:37:42,276 --> 06:37:44,429
And there can be many
ways to interpret that,

8910
06:37:44,430 --> 06:37:46,770
but what that taught me at least was that,

8911
06:37:46,770 --> 06:37:48,299
hey, it's at least the case right now

8912
06:37:48,299 --> 06:37:49,319
that if you were to just throw

8913
06:37:49,319 --> 06:37:51,150
a bunch of computer at this problem,

8914
06:37:51,150 --> 06:37:53,700
and you were trying to sort
of hyper parameter optimize,

8915
06:37:53,700 --> 06:37:56,310
or let some GPT model hard code

8916
06:37:56,310 --> 06:37:58,350
or come up with or invent
many different solutions,

8917
06:37:58,349 --> 06:37:59,669
if you were just optimizing for loss,

8918
06:37:59,669 --> 06:38:00,989
it would not be sufficient,

8919
06:38:00,990 --> 06:38:02,250
which means that there's still

8920
06:38:02,250 --> 06:38:03,962
some inherent modeling gap here.

8921
06:38:03,962 --> 06:38:05,310
There's still some artistry
left to be uncovered here

8922
06:38:05,310 --> 06:38:08,550
of how to get your model
to scale with more compute.

8923
06:38:08,549 --> 06:38:10,469
And that may be fundamentally
labeling problem,

8924
06:38:10,470 --> 06:38:12,930
but there may be other
components to this as well.

8925
06:38:12,930 --> 06:38:15,843
- Is it data constrained at this time?

8926
06:38:17,279 --> 06:38:18,729
Which is what it sounds like.

8927
06:38:20,490 --> 06:38:22,500
How do you get a lot of good labels?

8928
06:38:22,500 --> 06:38:24,569
- Yeah, I think it's
data quality constrained,

8929
06:38:24,569 --> 06:38:26,669
not necessarily data quantity constrained.

8930
06:38:27,810 --> 06:38:30,870
- But even like even just a quantity.

8931
06:38:30,869 --> 06:38:34,052
I mean, 'cause it has to be
trained on the interactions.

8932
06:38:35,189 --> 06:38:37,529
I guess there's not
that many interactions.

8933
06:38:37,529 --> 06:38:38,849
- Yeah, so it depends

8934
06:38:38,849 --> 06:38:39,959
what version of this you're talking about.

8935
06:38:39,959 --> 06:38:40,792
So if you're talking about like,

8936
06:38:40,793 --> 06:38:42,960
let's say the simplest
example of just 2D velocity,

8937
06:38:42,959 --> 06:38:44,489
then I think, yeah, data
quality is the main thing.

8938
06:38:44,490 --> 06:38:46,003
If you're talking about how to build

8939
06:38:46,003 --> 06:38:47,250
a sort of multifunction output

8940
06:38:47,250 --> 06:38:48,296
that lets you do all the inputs,

8941
06:38:48,296 --> 06:38:50,159
the computer that you and I can do,

8942
06:38:50,159 --> 06:38:51,599
then it's actually a much more

8943
06:38:51,599 --> 06:38:53,309
sophisticated nuanced modeling challenge,

8944
06:38:53,310 --> 06:38:55,260
because now you need to think about

8945
06:38:55,259 --> 06:38:57,539
not just when the user's left clicking,

8946
06:38:57,540 --> 06:38:58,650
but when you're building
the left click model,

8947
06:38:58,650 --> 06:38:59,640
you also need to be thinking about

8948
06:38:59,639 --> 06:39:00,689
how to make sure it doesn't fire

8949
06:39:00,689 --> 06:39:01,590
when they're trying to right click

8950
06:39:01,590 --> 06:39:02,970
or when they're trying to move the mouse.

8951
06:39:02,970 --> 06:39:04,380
So one example of an interesting bug

8952
06:39:04,380 --> 06:39:08,430
from like sort of week one
of a BCI with Nolan was,

8953
06:39:08,430 --> 06:39:10,290
when he moved the mouse,

8954
06:39:10,290 --> 06:39:11,760
the click signal sort
of dropped off a cliff,

8955
06:39:11,759 --> 06:39:12,989
and when he stopped, the
click signal went up.

8956
06:39:12,990 --> 06:39:16,020
So again, there's a contamination
between the two inputs.

8957
06:39:16,020 --> 06:39:19,619
Another good example was, at
one point, he was trying to do

8958
06:39:19,619 --> 06:39:21,539
sort of a left click and drag.

8959
06:39:21,540 --> 06:39:23,639
And the minute he started moving,

8960
06:39:23,639 --> 06:39:25,979
the left click signal dropped off a cliff.

8961
06:39:25,979 --> 06:39:27,329
So again, 'cause there's
some contamination

8962
06:39:27,330 --> 06:39:29,520
between the two signals, you
need to come up with some way

8963
06:39:29,520 --> 06:39:31,799
to either in the dataset or in the model,

8964
06:39:31,799 --> 06:39:34,292
build robustness against this kind of,

8965
06:39:35,430 --> 06:39:36,689
you think of it like
overfitting, but really,

8966
06:39:36,689 --> 06:39:38,430
it's just that the model has not seen

8967
06:39:38,430 --> 06:39:40,020
this kind of variability before.

8968
06:39:40,020 --> 06:39:42,090
So you need to find some way
to help the model with that.

8969
06:39:42,090 --> 06:39:44,099
- This is super cool because it feels like

8970
06:39:44,099 --> 06:39:46,469
all of this is very
solvable, but it's hard.

8971
06:39:46,470 --> 06:39:48,300
- Yes, it is fundamentally
an engineering challenge.

8972
06:39:48,299 --> 06:39:49,380
This is important to emphasize,

8973
06:39:49,380 --> 06:39:50,430
and it's also important to emphasize

8974
06:39:50,430 --> 06:39:52,560
that it may not need
fundamentally new techniques,

8975
06:39:52,560 --> 06:39:55,890
which means that people
who work on, let's say,

8976
06:39:55,889 --> 06:39:57,720
unsupervised speech classification

8977
06:39:57,720 --> 06:40:01,080
using CTC loss, for example,
with internal to Siri,

8978
06:40:01,080 --> 06:40:03,930
they could potentially have
very applicable skills to this.

8979
06:40:03,930 --> 06:40:06,439
- So what things are you excited about

8980
06:40:06,439 --> 06:40:07,840
in the future development

8981
06:40:09,029 --> 06:40:12,003
of the software stack on Neuralink?

8982
06:40:12,004 --> 06:40:13,229
So everything we've been talking about,

8983
06:40:13,229 --> 06:40:14,880
the decoding, the UX-

8984
06:40:14,880 --> 06:40:15,933
- I think there's some I'm excited about,

8985
06:40:15,933 --> 06:40:17,850
like something I'm excited
about from the technology side,

8986
06:40:17,849 --> 06:40:19,349
and some I'm excited
about for understanding

8987
06:40:19,349 --> 06:40:21,779
how this technology is
going to be best situated

8988
06:40:21,779 --> 06:40:22,612
for entering the world.

8989
06:40:22,613 --> 06:40:24,180
So I'll work backwards.

8990
06:40:24,180 --> 06:40:26,490
On the technology entering
the world side of things,

8991
06:40:26,490 --> 06:40:29,370
I'm really excited to
understand how this device works

8992
06:40:29,369 --> 06:40:31,862
for folks that cannot speak at all.

8993
06:40:31,863 --> 06:40:34,979
They have no ability to
sort of bootstrap themselves

8994
06:40:34,979 --> 06:40:37,709
into useful control by
voice command, for example,

8995
06:40:37,709 --> 06:40:40,319
and are extremely limited in
their current capabilities.

8996
06:40:40,319 --> 06:40:42,060
I think that will be an
incredibly useful signal for us

8997
06:40:42,060 --> 06:40:44,850
to understand, I mean, really
what is an existential threat

8998
06:40:44,849 --> 06:40:46,859
for all startups, which
is product market fit.

8999
06:40:46,860 --> 06:40:48,299
Does this device have the capacity

9000
06:40:48,299 --> 06:40:49,889
and potential to transform people's lives

9001
06:40:49,889 --> 06:40:50,880
in the current state?

9002
06:40:50,880 --> 06:40:52,500
And if not, what are the gaps?

9003
06:40:52,500 --> 06:40:53,520
And if there are gaps,

9004
06:40:53,520 --> 06:40:56,010
how do we solve them most efficiently?

9005
06:40:56,009 --> 06:40:57,052
So that's what I'm very
excited about for the next

9006
06:40:57,052 --> 06:40:59,970
sort of year or so of
clinical trial operations.

9007
06:40:59,970 --> 06:41:01,743
The technology side,

9008
06:41:03,180 --> 06:41:04,950
I'm quite excited about
basically everything we're doing.

9009
06:41:04,950 --> 06:41:07,080
I think it's gonna be awesome.

9010
06:41:07,080 --> 06:41:09,060
The most prominent one, I would say,

9011
06:41:09,060 --> 06:41:10,290
is scaling channel count.

9012
06:41:10,290 --> 06:41:12,299
So right now, we have a
thousand channel device.

9013
06:41:12,299 --> 06:41:14,639
The next version, we'll have
between 3 and 6,000 channels.

9014
06:41:14,639 --> 06:41:17,399
And I would expect that curve
to continue in the future.

9015
06:41:17,400 --> 06:41:19,290
And it's unclear what set of problems

9016
06:41:19,290 --> 06:41:22,200
will just disappear
completely at that scale,

9017
06:41:22,200 --> 06:41:23,549
and what set of problems will remain

9018
06:41:23,549 --> 06:41:24,382
and require for their focus.

9019
06:41:24,383 --> 06:41:26,280
And so I'm excited about
the clarity of gradient

9020
06:41:26,279 --> 06:41:28,259
that that gives us in terms
of the user experiences

9021
06:41:28,259 --> 06:41:30,569
we choose to focus our
time and resources on.

9022
06:41:30,569 --> 06:41:32,790
And also in terms of the, yeah,

9023
06:41:32,790 --> 06:41:34,530
even things as simple as not stationary.

9024
06:41:34,529 --> 06:41:35,819
Like does that problem just completely

9025
06:41:35,819 --> 06:41:36,652
go away at that scale,

9026
06:41:36,652 --> 06:41:38,279
or do we need to come
up with new creative UXs

9027
06:41:38,279 --> 06:41:39,529
still even at that point?

9028
06:41:40,799 --> 06:41:42,869
And also, when we get to that time point,

9029
06:41:42,869 --> 06:41:43,913
when we start expanding out dramatically

9030
06:41:43,913 --> 06:41:47,189
the set of functions that you
can output from one brain,

9031
06:41:47,189 --> 06:41:50,729
how to deal with all the nuances
of both the user experience

9032
06:41:50,729 --> 06:41:52,200
of not being able to
feel the different keys

9033
06:41:52,200 --> 06:41:53,729
under your fingertips, but
still needing to be able

9034
06:41:53,729 --> 06:41:55,268
to modulate all of them in synchrony

9035
06:41:55,268 --> 06:41:56,938
to achieve the thing you want.

9036
06:41:56,938 --> 06:41:58,590
And again, you don't have that appropriate

9037
06:41:58,590 --> 06:41:59,880
set to feedback loop,
so how can you make that

9038
06:41:59,880 --> 06:42:00,840
intuitive for a user to control

9039
06:42:00,840 --> 06:42:02,520
a high dimensional control surface

9040
06:42:02,520 --> 06:42:04,709
without feeling the thing physically?

9041
06:42:04,709 --> 06:42:07,049
I think that's gonna be a
super interesting problem.

9042
06:42:07,049 --> 06:42:09,840
I'm also quite excited to understand,

9043
06:42:09,840 --> 06:42:10,889
do these scaling laws continue?

9044
06:42:10,889 --> 06:42:12,930
Like as you scale channel count,

9045
06:42:12,930 --> 06:42:14,819
how much further out do you go

9046
06:42:14,819 --> 06:42:17,340
before that saturation point is truly hit?

9047
06:42:17,340 --> 06:42:18,630
And it's not obvious today.

9048
06:42:18,630 --> 06:42:19,462
I think we only know

9049
06:42:19,462 --> 06:42:20,819
what's in the sort of interpolation space.

9050
06:42:20,819 --> 06:42:22,619
We only know what's
between zero and 1,024.

9051
06:42:22,619 --> 06:42:25,020
We don't know what's beyond that.

9052
06:42:25,020 --> 06:42:26,189
And then there's a whole sort of like

9053
06:42:26,189 --> 06:42:27,750
range of interesting sort of neuroscience

9054
06:42:27,750 --> 06:42:29,459
and brain questions, which
is when you stick more stuff

9055
06:42:29,459 --> 06:42:30,899
in the brain, in more places,

9056
06:42:30,900 --> 06:42:32,760
you get to learn much more quickly about

9057
06:42:32,759 --> 06:42:34,590
what those brain regions represent.

9058
06:42:34,590 --> 06:42:36,150
And so I'm excited about that fundamental

9059
06:42:36,150 --> 06:42:37,860
neuroscience learning,
which is also important

9060
06:42:37,860 --> 06:42:40,590
for figuring out how,
and to most efficiently,

9061
06:42:40,590 --> 06:42:42,270
insert electrodes in the future.

9062
06:42:42,270 --> 06:42:43,860
So yeah, I think all those dimensions,

9063
06:42:43,860 --> 06:42:44,757
I'm really, really excited about.

9064
06:42:44,757 --> 06:42:46,290
And that doesn't even
get close to touching

9065
06:42:46,290 --> 06:42:47,670
the sort of software stack that
we work on every single day

9066
06:42:47,669 --> 06:42:49,829
and what we're working on right now.

9067
06:42:49,830 --> 06:42:53,340
- Yeah, it seems
virtually impossible to me

9068
06:42:53,340 --> 06:42:58,340
that a thousand electrodes
is where it saturates.

9069
06:42:58,770 --> 06:43:01,590
It feels like this would be one of those

9070
06:43:01,590 --> 06:43:04,020
silly notions in the
future, where obviously,

9071
06:43:04,020 --> 06:43:06,150
you should have millions of electrodes,

9072
06:43:06,150 --> 06:43:10,020
and this is where like the
true breakthroughs happen.

9073
06:43:10,020 --> 06:43:11,490
- Yeah.

9074
06:43:11,490 --> 06:43:13,356
- You tweeted-
- Oh.

9075
06:43:13,356 --> 06:43:17,759
- "Some thoughts are most
precisely described in poetry."

9076
06:43:17,759 --> 06:43:19,022
Why do you think that is?

9077
06:43:20,130 --> 06:43:23,100
- I think it's because
the information bottleneck

9078
06:43:23,099 --> 06:43:26,912
of language is pretty steep.

9079
06:43:28,380 --> 06:43:30,569
And yet you're able to reconstruct

9080
06:43:30,569 --> 06:43:34,319
in the other person's
brain more effectively

9081
06:43:34,319 --> 06:43:35,400
without being literal.

9082
06:43:35,400 --> 06:43:38,550
If you can express a sentiment
such that in their brain,

9083
06:43:38,549 --> 06:43:42,419
they can reconstruct the
actual true underlying

9084
06:43:42,419 --> 06:43:43,589
meaning and beauty of the thing

9085
06:43:43,590 --> 06:43:45,209
that you're trying to get across.

9086
06:43:45,209 --> 06:43:46,559
The sort of the generator function

9087
06:43:46,560 --> 06:43:47,430
in their brain's more powerful

9088
06:43:47,430 --> 06:43:48,540
than what language can express.

9089
06:43:48,540 --> 06:43:52,650
And so the mechanism of
poetry is really just

9090
06:43:52,650 --> 06:43:56,490
to feed or seed that generator function.

9091
06:43:56,490 --> 06:44:00,390
- So being literal sometimes
is a suboptimal compression

9092
06:44:00,389 --> 06:44:02,290
for the thing you're trying to convey.

9093
06:44:03,659 --> 06:44:05,369
- And it's actually in
the process of the user

9094
06:44:05,369 --> 06:44:06,360
going through that generation

9095
06:44:06,360 --> 06:44:08,459
that they understand what you mean.

9096
06:44:08,459 --> 06:44:09,809
That's the beautiful part.

9097
06:44:09,810 --> 06:44:11,400
It's also like when you look
at a beautiful painting,

9098
06:44:11,400 --> 06:44:14,490
like it's not the pixels of the
painting that are beautiful,

9099
06:44:14,490 --> 06:44:17,070
it's the thought process that
occurs when you see that,

9100
06:44:17,069 --> 06:44:18,419
the experience of that.

9101
06:44:18,419 --> 06:44:19,799
That actually is a thing that matters.

9102
06:44:19,799 --> 06:44:21,840
- Yeah, it's resonating with some deep-

9103
06:44:21,840 --> 06:44:23,400
- [Bliss] Yeah.

9104
06:44:23,400 --> 06:44:26,730
- Thing within you that
the artist also experienced

9105
06:44:26,729 --> 06:44:29,489
and was able to convey
that through the pixels.

9106
06:44:29,490 --> 06:44:32,853
And that's actually gonna be
relevant for full on telepathy.

9107
06:44:34,470 --> 06:44:38,250
It's like if you just read
the poetry, literally,

9108
06:44:38,250 --> 06:44:42,119
that doesn't say much
of anything interesting.

9109
06:44:42,119 --> 06:44:44,163
It requires a human to interpret it.

9110
06:44:45,810 --> 06:44:47,729
So it's the combination of the human mind

9111
06:44:47,729 --> 06:44:50,909
and all the experiences
that human being has

9112
06:44:50,909 --> 06:44:53,159
within the context of the
collective intelligence

9113
06:44:53,159 --> 06:44:56,669
of the human species that
makes that poem make sense.

9114
06:44:56,669 --> 06:44:58,326
And they load that in.

9115
06:44:58,327 --> 06:45:01,560
And so in that same way,
the signal that carries

9116
06:45:01,560 --> 06:45:06,090
from human to human
meaning may seem trivial,

9117
06:45:06,090 --> 06:45:08,590
but may actually carry a lot of power

9118
06:45:11,700 --> 06:45:13,319
because of the complexity

9119
06:45:13,319 --> 06:45:15,393
of the human mind on the receiving end.

9120
06:45:16,950 --> 06:45:18,780
Yeah, that's interesting.

9121
06:45:18,779 --> 06:45:20,789
Poetry still doesn't, who is it?

9122
06:45:20,790 --> 06:45:24,250
I think Yoshi Bako first said

9123
06:45:26,549 --> 06:45:30,779
something about all the people that think

9124
06:45:30,779 --> 06:45:35,762
we've achieved AGI explain
why humans like music.

9125
06:45:37,200 --> 06:45:38,069
- [Bliss] Oh yeah.

9126
06:45:38,069 --> 06:45:43,069
- And until the AGI likes music,

9127
06:45:43,080 --> 06:45:44,370
you haven't achieved AGI

9128
06:45:44,369 --> 06:45:45,479
or something like this.
- Do you not think

9129
06:45:45,479 --> 06:45:48,119
that's like some next
token entropy surprise

9130
06:45:48,119 --> 06:45:49,191
kind of thing going on there?

9131
06:45:49,191 --> 06:45:51,438
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

9132
06:45:51,438 --> 06:45:52,649
I listen to a lot of classical music

9133
06:45:52,650 --> 06:45:54,120
and also read a lot of poetry.

9134
06:45:54,119 --> 06:45:57,659
And yeah, I do wonder if
like there is some element

9135
06:45:57,659 --> 06:45:59,669
of the next token surprise
factor going on there.

9136
06:45:59,669 --> 06:46:00,572
- Yeah, maybe.
- Because I mean,

9137
06:46:00,573 --> 06:46:03,209
like a lot of the tricks
in both poetry and music

9138
06:46:03,209 --> 06:46:05,006
are like basically, you have
some repeated structure.

9139
06:46:05,007 --> 06:46:06,330
And then you do like a twist.

9140
06:46:06,330 --> 06:46:08,460
It's like, okay, verse or
like clause one, two, three

9141
06:46:08,459 --> 06:46:10,200
is one thing, and then
clause four is like,

9142
06:46:10,200 --> 06:46:12,209
okay, now we're onto the next theme.

9143
06:46:12,209 --> 06:46:14,639
And they kind of play with
exactly when the surprise happens

9144
06:46:14,639 --> 06:46:16,110
and the expectation of the user.

9145
06:46:16,110 --> 06:46:17,520
And that's even true like,

9146
06:46:17,520 --> 06:46:20,340
through history as musicians evolve music,

9147
06:46:20,340 --> 06:46:21,659
they take like some nuanced structure

9148
06:46:21,659 --> 06:46:22,492
that people are familiar with

9149
06:46:22,492 --> 06:46:24,329
and they just tweak it a little bit.

9150
06:46:24,330 --> 06:46:25,920
Like they tweak it and
add a surprising element.

9151
06:46:25,919 --> 06:46:29,039
This is especially true in
classical music heritage.

9152
06:46:29,040 --> 06:46:31,904
But that's what I'm wondering,
like is it all just entropy-

9153
06:46:31,903 --> 06:46:34,949
- So breaking structure
or breaking symmetry

9154
06:46:34,950 --> 06:46:36,540
is something that humans seem to like.

9155
06:46:36,540 --> 06:46:37,620
Maybe as simple as that.

9156
06:46:37,619 --> 06:46:40,379
- Yeah, and I mean, great artists copy,

9157
06:46:40,380 --> 06:46:42,569
and they also, knowing
which rules to break

9158
06:46:42,569 --> 06:46:44,009
is the important part.

9159
06:46:44,009 --> 06:46:45,629
And that fundamentally, it must be about

9160
06:46:45,630 --> 06:46:47,340
the listener of the piece.

9161
06:46:47,340 --> 06:46:49,200
Like which rule is the right one to break,

9162
06:46:49,200 --> 06:46:51,030
it's about the user or the audience member

9163
06:46:51,029 --> 06:46:52,893
perceiving that as interesting.

9164
06:46:54,180 --> 06:46:56,872
- What do you think is the
meaning of human existence?

9165
06:47:00,299 --> 06:47:03,630
- There's a TV show I really
like called "The West Wing."

9166
06:47:03,630 --> 06:47:05,819
And in "The West Wing,"
there's a character.

9167
06:47:05,819 --> 06:47:07,229
He's the president of the United States

9168
06:47:07,229 --> 06:47:09,450
who's having a discussion about the Bible

9169
06:47:09,450 --> 06:47:11,073
with one of their colleagues.

9170
06:47:11,970 --> 06:47:15,187
And the colleague says something about,

9171
06:47:15,187 --> 06:47:17,400
"The Bible says X, Y, and Z."

9172
06:47:17,400 --> 06:47:21,058
And the President says, "Yeah,
but it also says A, B, C."

9173
06:47:21,058 --> 06:47:23,047
And the person says,

9174
06:47:23,046 --> 06:47:25,079
"Do you believe the Bible
to be literally true?"

9175
06:47:25,080 --> 06:47:28,740
And the President says,
"Yes, but I also think

9176
06:47:28,740 --> 06:47:31,097
that neither of us are smart
enough to understand it."

9177
06:47:32,159 --> 06:47:34,829
I think the analogy here
for the meaning of life

9178
06:47:34,830 --> 06:47:37,740
is that largely, we don't know
the right question to ask.

9179
06:47:37,740 --> 06:47:39,730
And so I think I'm very aligned with

9180
06:47:42,060 --> 06:47:44,940
sort of "The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the Galaxy" version

9181
06:47:44,939 --> 06:47:46,139
of this question, which is basically,

9182
06:47:46,139 --> 06:47:48,212
if we can ask the right questions,

9183
06:47:49,349 --> 06:47:50,549
it's much more likely we find

9184
06:47:50,549 --> 06:47:52,349
the meaning of human existence.

9185
06:47:52,349 --> 06:47:53,182
And so in the short term,

9186
06:47:53,183 --> 06:47:56,340
as a heuristic in the sort
of search policy space,

9187
06:47:56,340 --> 06:47:58,380
we should try to increase the diversity

9188
06:47:58,380 --> 06:48:00,780
of people asking such questions,

9189
06:48:00,779 --> 06:48:02,189
or generally of consciousness

9190
06:48:02,189 --> 06:48:04,340
and conscious beings
asking such questions.

9191
06:48:05,220 --> 06:48:07,950
So again, I think I'll take
the 'I don't know card' here,

9192
06:48:07,950 --> 06:48:10,530
but say I do think there are
meaningful things we can do

9193
06:48:10,529 --> 06:48:13,199
that improve the likelihood
of answering that question.

9194
06:48:13,200 --> 06:48:16,470
- It's interesting how
much value you assign

9195
06:48:16,470 --> 06:48:18,663
to the task of asking the right questions.

9196
06:48:19,557 --> 06:48:23,250
That's the main thing is not the answers,

9197
06:48:23,250 --> 06:48:24,720
it's the questions.

9198
06:48:24,720 --> 06:48:26,620
- This point by the way is driven home

9199
06:48:27,900 --> 06:48:29,610
in a very painful way when
you try to communicate

9200
06:48:29,610 --> 06:48:32,729
with someone who cannot speak,
because a lot of the time,

9201
06:48:32,729 --> 06:48:34,200
the last thing to go is
they have the ability

9202
06:48:34,200 --> 06:48:36,630
to somehow wiggle a lip or move something

9203
06:48:36,630 --> 06:48:38,909
that allows them to say yes or no.

9204
06:48:38,909 --> 06:48:41,220
And in that situation, it's very obvious

9205
06:48:41,220 --> 06:48:43,110
that what matters is, are you asking them

9206
06:48:43,110 --> 06:48:45,420
the right question to be
able to say yes or no to?

9207
06:48:45,419 --> 06:48:46,592
- Wow, that's powerful.

9208
06:48:47,490 --> 06:48:50,909
Well, Bliss, thank you
for everything you do,

9209
06:48:50,909 --> 06:48:53,040
and thank you for being you,

9210
06:48:53,040 --> 06:48:54,750
and thank you for talking today.

9211
06:48:54,750 --> 06:48:56,220
- Thank you.

9212
06:48:56,220 --> 06:48:57,052
- Thanks for listening

9213
06:48:57,052 --> 06:48:59,549
to this conversation with Bliss Chapman.

9214
06:48:59,549 --> 06:49:03,389
And now, dear friends,
here's Noland Arbaugh,

9215
06:49:03,389 --> 06:49:06,149
the first human being to
have a Neuralink device

9216
06:49:06,150 --> 06:49:07,893
implanted in his brain.

9217
06:49:08,939 --> 06:49:13,500
You had a diving accident in
2016 that left you paralyzed

9218
06:49:13,500 --> 06:49:16,110
with no feeling from the shoulders down.

9219
06:49:16,110 --> 06:49:17,897
How did that accident change your life?

9220
06:49:17,897 --> 06:49:21,120
- That's sort of a freak
thing that happened.

9221
06:49:21,119 --> 06:49:25,289
Imagine you're running into the ocean,

9222
06:49:25,290 --> 06:49:28,080
although this is a lake, but
you're running into the ocean

9223
06:49:28,080 --> 06:49:30,300
and you get to about waist high,

9224
06:49:30,299 --> 06:49:32,489
and then you kind of like dive in,

9225
06:49:32,490 --> 06:49:35,010
take the rest of the plunge
under the wave or something.

9226
06:49:35,009 --> 06:49:36,689
That's what I did.

9227
06:49:36,689 --> 06:49:38,849
And then I just never came back up.

9228
06:49:38,849 --> 06:49:41,309
Not sure what happened.

9229
06:49:41,310 --> 06:49:44,880
I did it running into the
water with a couple of guys.

9230
06:49:44,880 --> 06:49:48,360
And so my idea of what happened

9231
06:49:48,360 --> 06:49:53,360
is really just that I
took like a stray fist,

9232
06:49:53,819 --> 06:49:57,810
elbow, knee, foot, something
to the side of my head.

9233
06:49:57,810 --> 06:49:59,700
The left side of my head was sore

9234
06:49:59,700 --> 06:50:01,500
for about a month afterwards.

9235
06:50:01,500 --> 06:50:03,779
So must must've taken a pretty big knock.

9236
06:50:03,779 --> 06:50:06,779
And then they both came up, and I didn't.

9237
06:50:06,779 --> 06:50:09,419
And so I was face down
in the water for a while.

9238
06:50:09,419 --> 06:50:10,893
I was conscious.

9239
06:50:12,389 --> 06:50:15,479
And then eventually just realized

9240
06:50:15,479 --> 06:50:16,709
I couldn't hold my breath any longer.

9241
06:50:16,709 --> 06:50:19,826
And I keep saying, "Took a big drink."

9242
06:50:20,819 --> 06:50:23,810
People, I don't know if
they like that I say that.

9243
06:50:23,810 --> 06:50:25,350
It seems like I'm making light of it all,

9244
06:50:25,349 --> 06:50:28,529
but it's just kind of how I am.

9245
06:50:28,529 --> 06:50:33,529
And I don't know, like I'm a very relaxed

9246
06:50:36,810 --> 06:50:39,569
sort of stress-free person.

9247
06:50:39,569 --> 06:50:44,143
I rolled with the punches
for a lot of this.

9248
06:50:44,143 --> 06:50:45,810
I kind of took it in stride.

9249
06:50:45,810 --> 06:50:47,729
It's like, "All right,
well what can I do next?

9250
06:50:47,729 --> 06:50:50,439
How can I improve my
life even a little bit

9251
06:50:51,360 --> 06:50:52,650
on a day-to-day basis?"

9252
06:50:52,650 --> 06:50:55,680
At first, just trying
to find some way to heal

9253
06:50:55,680 --> 06:50:57,393
as much of my body as possible,

9254
06:50:58,889 --> 06:51:02,489
to try to get healed, to
try to get off a ventilator,

9255
06:51:02,490 --> 06:51:07,490
learn as much as I could
so I could somehow survive

9256
06:51:09,990 --> 06:51:11,403
once I left the hospital.

9257
06:51:12,810 --> 06:51:17,040
And then thank God I had
like my family around me.

9258
06:51:17,040 --> 06:51:21,540
If I didn't have my parents, my siblings,

9259
06:51:21,540 --> 06:51:24,000
then I would've never made it this far.

9260
06:51:24,000 --> 06:51:26,639
They've done so much for me,

9261
06:51:26,639 --> 06:51:31,380
more than like I can ever
thank them for, honestly.

9262
06:51:31,380 --> 06:51:33,090
And a lot of people don't have that.

9263
06:51:33,090 --> 06:51:35,159
A lot of people in my situation,

9264
06:51:35,159 --> 06:51:37,889
their families either aren't
capable of providing for them,

9265
06:51:37,889 --> 06:51:41,279
or honestly, just don't want to.

9266
06:51:41,279 --> 06:51:44,909
And so they get placed
somewhere in some sort of home.

9267
06:51:44,909 --> 06:51:47,310
So thankfully I had my family.

9268
06:51:47,310 --> 06:51:49,080
I have a great group of friends,

9269
06:51:49,080 --> 06:51:51,060
a great group of buddies from college

9270
06:51:51,060 --> 06:51:53,430
who have all rallied around me,

9271
06:51:53,430 --> 06:51:56,520
and we're all still incredibly close.

9272
06:51:56,520 --> 06:51:58,409
People always say, "If you're lucky,

9273
06:51:58,409 --> 06:52:02,400
you'll end up with one or
two friends from high school

9274
06:52:02,400 --> 06:52:04,530
that you keep throughout your life."

9275
06:52:04,529 --> 06:52:08,789
I have about 10 or 12 from high school

9276
06:52:08,790 --> 06:52:10,380
that have all stuck around,

9277
06:52:10,380 --> 06:52:14,159
and we still get together,
all of us twice a year.

9278
06:52:14,159 --> 06:52:17,340
We call it the spring
series and the fall series.

9279
06:52:17,340 --> 06:52:21,119
This last one we all did,
we dressed up like X-Men.

9280
06:52:21,119 --> 06:52:25,529
So I did a Professor Xavier,
and it was freaking awesome.

9281
06:52:25,529 --> 06:52:27,149
It was so good.

9282
06:52:27,150 --> 06:52:29,370
So yeah, I have such a great
support system around me.

9283
06:52:29,369 --> 06:52:33,809
And so being a quadriplegic
isn't that bad.

9284
06:52:33,810 --> 06:52:37,110
I get waited on all the time.

9285
06:52:37,110 --> 06:52:41,040
People bring me food and
drinks, and I get to sit around

9286
06:52:41,040 --> 06:52:45,479
and watch as much TV and
movies and anime as I want.

9287
06:52:45,479 --> 06:52:47,733
I get to read as much as I want.

9288
06:52:49,139 --> 06:52:51,419
I mean, it's great.

9289
06:52:51,419 --> 06:52:52,799
- It's beautiful to see that

9290
06:52:52,799 --> 06:52:56,700
you see the silver lining in all of this.

9291
06:52:56,700 --> 06:52:59,340
Just going back, do
you remember the moment

9292
06:52:59,340 --> 06:53:01,830
when you first realized you were paralyzed

9293
06:53:01,830 --> 06:53:04,230
from the neck down?
- Yeah, yep.

9294
06:53:04,229 --> 06:53:06,159
I was face down in the water

9295
06:53:07,139 --> 06:53:10,049
right when whatever something hit my head.

9296
06:53:10,049 --> 06:53:14,309
I tried to get up and I
realized I couldn't move

9297
06:53:14,310 --> 06:53:16,363
and it just sort of clicked.

9298
06:53:16,363 --> 06:53:17,639
I'm like, "All right, I'm paralyzed.

9299
06:53:17,639 --> 06:53:18,630
Can't move.

9300
06:53:18,630 --> 06:53:19,563
What do I do?

9301
06:53:20,712 --> 06:53:23,099
If I can't get up, I can't flip over,

9302
06:53:23,099 --> 06:53:26,906
can't do anything, then I'm
gonna drown eventually."

9303
06:53:28,110 --> 06:53:30,330
And I knew I couldn't
hold my breath forever,

9304
06:53:30,330 --> 06:53:34,890
so I just held my breath
and thought about it

9305
06:53:34,889 --> 06:53:37,860
for maybe 10, 15 seconds.

9306
06:53:37,860 --> 06:53:41,430
I've heard from other people
that like look on liquors,

9307
06:53:41,430 --> 06:53:44,520
I guess the two girls that
pulled me out of the water

9308
06:53:44,520 --> 06:53:45,630
were two of my best friends.

9309
06:53:45,630 --> 06:53:46,712
They're lifeguards.

9310
06:53:48,090 --> 06:53:51,900
And one of them said that
it looked like my body

9311
06:53:51,900 --> 06:53:53,430
was sort of shaking in the water,

9312
06:53:53,430 --> 06:53:55,683
like I was trying to flip over and stuff.

9313
06:53:57,569 --> 06:53:59,759
But I knew, I knew immediately.

9314
06:53:59,759 --> 06:54:02,669
And I just kind of,

9315
06:54:02,669 --> 06:54:07,619
I realized that that's
what my situation was

9316
06:54:07,619 --> 06:54:08,729
from here on out.

9317
06:54:08,729 --> 06:54:10,020
Maybe if I got to the hospital,

9318
06:54:10,020 --> 06:54:11,490
they'd be able to do something.

9319
06:54:11,490 --> 06:54:12,690
When I was in the hospital,

9320
06:54:12,689 --> 06:54:14,159
like right before surgery,

9321
06:54:14,159 --> 06:54:17,819
I was trying to calm
one of my friends down.

9322
06:54:17,819 --> 06:54:20,700
I had like brought her with
me from college to camp,

9323
06:54:20,700 --> 06:54:22,566
and she was just bawling
over me, and I was like,

9324
06:54:22,566 --> 06:54:23,819
"Hey, it's gonna be fine.

9325
06:54:23,819 --> 06:54:25,709
Like don't worry."

9326
06:54:25,709 --> 06:54:28,919
I was cracking some jokes
to try to lighten the mood.

9327
06:54:28,919 --> 06:54:30,636
The nurse had called
my mom, and I was like,

9328
06:54:30,636 --> 06:54:32,399
"Don't tell my mom.

9329
06:54:32,400 --> 06:54:34,020
She's just gonna be stressed out.

9330
06:54:34,020 --> 06:54:36,090
Call her after I'm out of surgery,"

9331
06:54:36,090 --> 06:54:38,040
'cause at least she'll
have some answers then,

9332
06:54:38,040 --> 06:54:40,473
like whether I live or not, really.

9333
06:54:41,490 --> 06:54:43,050
And I didn't want her to be stressed

9334
06:54:43,049 --> 06:54:44,189
through the whole thing.

9335
06:54:44,189 --> 06:54:45,022
But I knew.

9336
06:54:45,023 --> 06:54:48,299
And then when I first
woke up after surgery,

9337
06:54:48,299 --> 06:54:50,369
I was super drugged up.

9338
06:54:50,369 --> 06:54:54,828
They had me on fentanyl like
three ways, which was awesome.

9339
06:54:54,829 --> 06:54:59,829
I don't recommend it, but
I saw some crazy stuff

9340
06:55:01,560 --> 06:55:03,540
on that fentanyl, and it was still

9341
06:55:03,540 --> 06:55:06,273
the best I've ever felt on drugs.

9342
06:55:07,529 --> 06:55:09,692
Medication, sorry, on medication.

9343
06:55:11,250 --> 06:55:15,209
And I remember the first time
I saw my mom in the hospital.

9344
06:55:15,209 --> 06:55:16,649
I was just bawling.

9345
06:55:16,650 --> 06:55:20,010
I had like ventilator in,

9346
06:55:20,009 --> 06:55:21,959
like I couldn't talk or anything,

9347
06:55:21,959 --> 06:55:24,779
and I just started crying,

9348
06:55:24,779 --> 06:55:26,733
because it was more like seeing her.

9349
06:55:28,290 --> 06:55:31,799
I mean, the whole situation
obviously was pretty rough,

9350
06:55:31,799 --> 06:55:33,750
but it was just like seeing her face

9351
06:55:33,750 --> 06:55:35,610
for the first time was pretty hard.

9352
06:55:35,610 --> 06:55:40,610
But yeah, I never had like a moment of,

9353
06:55:42,487 --> 06:55:45,540
"Man, I'm paralyzed.

9354
06:55:45,540 --> 06:55:46,372
This sucks.

9355
06:55:46,372 --> 06:55:48,509
I don't wanna like be around anymore."

9356
06:55:48,509 --> 06:55:52,649
It was always just, "I hate
that I have to do this,

9357
06:55:52,650 --> 06:55:57,030
but like sitting here and
wallowing isn't gonna help."

9358
06:55:57,029 --> 06:55:58,860
- So immediate acceptance.

9359
06:55:58,860 --> 06:56:01,170
- [Noland] Yeah, yeah.

9360
06:56:01,169 --> 06:56:03,539
- Has there been low points along the way?

9361
06:56:03,540 --> 06:56:04,802
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

9362
06:56:06,180 --> 06:56:09,000
I mean, there are days
when I don't really feel

9363
06:56:09,000 --> 06:56:10,169
like doing anything.

9364
06:56:10,169 --> 06:56:11,579
Not so much anymore.

9365
06:56:11,580 --> 06:56:13,140
Like not for the last couple years,

9366
06:56:13,139 --> 06:56:14,399
I don't really feel that way.

9367
06:56:14,400 --> 06:56:19,400
I've more so just wanted to
try to do anything possible

9368
06:56:21,240 --> 06:56:24,300
to make my life better at this point.

9369
06:56:24,299 --> 06:56:26,790
But at the beginning, there
were some ups and downs.

9370
06:56:26,790 --> 06:56:29,190
There were some really
hard things to adjust to.

9371
06:56:30,450 --> 06:56:32,490
First off, just like
the first couple months,

9372
06:56:32,490 --> 06:56:35,513
the amount of pain I was
in was really, really hard.

9373
06:56:35,512 --> 06:56:38,430
I mean, I remember screaming

9374
06:56:38,430 --> 06:56:40,319
at the top of my lungs in the hospital,

9375
06:56:40,319 --> 06:56:42,419
because I thought my legs were on fire.

9376
06:56:42,419 --> 06:56:44,729
And obviously, I can't feel anything,

9377
06:56:44,729 --> 06:56:46,290
but it's all nerve pain.

9378
06:56:46,290 --> 06:56:48,209
And so that was a really hard night.

9379
06:56:48,209 --> 06:56:51,029
I asked them to give me as
much pain meds as possible.

9380
06:56:51,029 --> 06:56:53,309
They're like, "You've had
as much as you can have,

9381
06:56:53,310 --> 06:56:55,020
so just kind of deal with it.

9382
06:56:55,020 --> 06:56:56,700
Go to a happy place sort of thing."

9383
06:56:56,700 --> 06:56:58,250
So that was a pretty low point.

9384
06:56:59,159 --> 06:57:01,110
And then every now and again, it's hard,

9385
06:57:01,110 --> 06:57:04,889
like realizing things that
I wanted to do in my life

9386
06:57:04,889 --> 06:57:06,639
that I won't be able to do anymore.

9387
06:57:08,159 --> 06:57:11,250
I always wanted to be
a husband and father,

9388
06:57:11,250 --> 06:57:13,919
and I just don't think
that I could do it now

9389
06:57:13,919 --> 06:57:14,819
as a quadriplegic.

9390
06:57:14,819 --> 06:57:17,590
Maybe it's possible, but
I'm not sure I would ever

9391
06:57:18,689 --> 06:57:22,052
put someone I love through that,

9392
06:57:23,130 --> 06:57:25,180
like having to take care of me and stuff.

9393
06:57:26,340 --> 06:57:29,220
Not being able to go out and play sports.

9394
06:57:29,220 --> 06:57:32,883
I was a huge athlete growing
up, so that was pretty hard.

9395
06:57:33,779 --> 06:57:37,139
Little things too, when I
realized I can't do them anymore.

9396
06:57:37,139 --> 06:57:40,110
Like there's something really special

9397
06:57:40,110 --> 06:57:44,459
about being able to hold
a book and smell a book.

9398
06:57:44,459 --> 06:57:47,279
Like the feel, the texture, the smell,

9399
06:57:47,279 --> 06:57:49,619
like as you turn the
pages, like I just love it.

9400
06:57:49,619 --> 06:57:50,546
I can't do it anymore.

9401
06:57:50,546 --> 06:57:52,292
And it's little things like that.

9402
06:57:53,250 --> 06:57:55,619
The two-year mark was pretty rough.

9403
06:57:55,619 --> 06:58:00,619
Two years is when they say
you will get back basically

9404
06:58:02,490 --> 06:58:03,960
as much as you're ever gonna get back,

9405
06:58:03,959 --> 06:58:06,090
as far as movement and sensation goes.

9406
06:58:06,090 --> 06:58:07,560
And so for the first two years,

9407
06:58:07,560 --> 06:58:10,680
that was the only thing
on my mind was like

9408
06:58:10,680 --> 06:58:14,189
try as much as I can to move my fingers,

9409
06:58:14,189 --> 06:58:17,099
my hands, my feet, everything possible

9410
06:58:17,099 --> 06:58:19,079
to try to get sensation and movement back.

9411
06:58:19,080 --> 06:58:21,900
And then when the two-year mark hit,

9412
06:58:21,900 --> 06:58:26,133
so June 30th, 2018,

9413
06:58:28,066 --> 06:58:32,082
I was really sad that
that's kind of where I was.

9414
06:58:33,599 --> 06:58:35,430
And then just randomly here and there,

9415
06:58:35,430 --> 06:58:40,430
but I was never like depressed
for long periods of time.

9416
06:58:41,400 --> 06:58:45,930
Just it never seemed worthwhile to me.

9417
06:58:45,930 --> 06:58:47,670
- What gave you strength?

9418
06:58:47,669 --> 06:58:48,539
- My faith.

9419
06:58:48,540 --> 06:58:51,120
My faith in God was a big one.

9420
06:58:51,119 --> 06:58:54,270
My understanding that it
was all for a purpose.

9421
06:58:54,270 --> 06:58:57,029
And even if that purpose wasn't anything

9422
06:58:57,029 --> 06:58:59,882
involving Neuralink,
even if that purpose was,

9423
06:59:02,342 --> 06:59:05,137
there's a story in the Bible about Job,

9424
06:59:05,137 --> 06:59:07,169
and I think it's a really,
really popular story,

9425
06:59:07,169 --> 06:59:10,379
about how Job has all
of these terrible things

9426
06:59:10,380 --> 06:59:11,700
happen to him, and he praises God

9427
06:59:11,700 --> 06:59:14,310
throughout the whole situation.

9428
06:59:14,310 --> 06:59:17,610
I thought, and I think
a lot of people think

9429
06:59:17,610 --> 06:59:20,310
for most of their lives that they are Job,

9430
06:59:20,310 --> 06:59:22,890
that they're the ones going
through something terrible,

9431
06:59:22,889 --> 06:59:26,700
and they just need to praise
God through the whole thing

9432
06:59:26,700 --> 06:59:28,319
and everything will work out.

9433
06:59:28,319 --> 06:59:30,119
At some point after my accident,

9434
06:59:30,119 --> 06:59:33,869
I realized that I might not be Job,

9435
06:59:33,869 --> 06:59:36,869
that I might be one of his children

9436
06:59:36,869 --> 06:59:40,079
that gets killed or
kidnapped or taken from him.

9437
06:59:40,080 --> 06:59:44,220
And so it's about terrible
things that happen

9438
06:59:44,220 --> 06:59:45,930
to those around you who you love.

9439
06:59:45,930 --> 06:59:49,290
So maybe, in this case,
my mom would be Job,

9440
06:59:49,290 --> 06:59:54,000
and she has to get through
something extraordinarily hard

9441
06:59:54,000 --> 06:59:57,240
and I just need to try and make it

9442
06:59:57,240 --> 06:59:59,430
as best as possible for her,

9443
06:59:59,430 --> 07:00:02,369
because she's the one that's really

9444
07:00:02,369 --> 07:00:04,619
going through this massive trial.

9445
07:00:04,619 --> 07:00:06,450
And that gave me a lot of strength.

9446
07:00:06,450 --> 07:00:07,773
And obviously, my family.

9447
07:00:08,610 --> 07:00:10,200
My family and my friends,

9448
07:00:10,200 --> 07:00:13,590
they give me all the strength that I need

9449
07:00:13,590 --> 07:00:15,180
on a day-to-day basis.

9450
07:00:15,180 --> 07:00:17,189
So it makes things a lot easier

9451
07:00:17,189 --> 07:00:20,039
having that great
support system around me.

9452
07:00:20,040 --> 07:00:21,630
- From everything I've seen of you online,

9453
07:00:21,630 --> 07:00:26,630
your streams and the way you
are today, I really admire,

9454
07:00:26,909 --> 07:00:30,389
let's say, your unwavering
positive outlook on life.

9455
07:00:30,389 --> 07:00:32,489
Has that always been this way?

9456
07:00:32,490 --> 07:00:33,963
- Yeah, yeah.

9457
07:00:35,020 --> 07:00:37,847
I mean, I've just always thought

9458
07:00:39,569 --> 07:00:42,689
I could do anything I ever wanted to do.

9459
07:00:42,689 --> 07:00:44,699
There was never anything too big.

9460
07:00:44,700 --> 07:00:47,762
Like whatever I set my mind
to, I felt like I could do it.

9461
07:00:49,049 --> 07:00:52,469
I didn't wanna do a lot.

9462
07:00:52,470 --> 07:00:54,030
I wanted to like travel around

9463
07:00:54,029 --> 07:00:58,139
and be sort of like a gypsy
and like go work odd jobs.

9464
07:00:58,139 --> 07:01:00,689
I had this dream of
traveling around Europe

9465
07:01:00,689 --> 07:01:02,729
and being like, I don't know,

9466
07:01:02,729 --> 07:01:06,090
a shepherd in like Wales or Ireland.

9467
07:01:06,090 --> 07:01:09,180
And then going and being
a fisherman in Italy,

9468
07:01:09,180 --> 07:01:10,799
doing all these things for like a year.

9469
07:01:10,799 --> 07:01:13,110
Like it's such like cliche things,

9470
07:01:13,110 --> 07:01:14,970
but I just thought it would be so much fun

9471
07:01:14,970 --> 07:01:17,700
to go and travel and do different things.

9472
07:01:17,700 --> 07:01:21,930
And so I've always just seen

9473
07:01:21,930 --> 07:01:24,930
the best in people around me too.

9474
07:01:24,930 --> 07:01:28,500
And I've always tried
to be good to people.

9475
07:01:28,500 --> 07:01:31,349
And growing up with my mom too,

9476
07:01:31,349 --> 07:01:35,009
she's like the most positive
energetic person in the world.

9477
07:01:35,009 --> 07:01:37,262
And we're all just people people.

9478
07:01:38,310 --> 07:01:40,920
I just get along great with people.

9479
07:01:40,919 --> 07:01:42,719
I really enjoy meeting new people,

9480
07:01:42,720 --> 07:01:46,233
and so I just wanted to do everything.

9481
07:01:47,310 --> 07:01:50,430
This is just kind of just how I've been.

9482
07:01:50,430 --> 07:01:53,909
- It's just great to see that
cynicism didn't take over,

9483
07:01:53,909 --> 07:01:55,229
given everything you've been through.

9484
07:01:55,229 --> 07:01:56,819
- Yeah.

9485
07:01:56,819 --> 07:01:59,250
- Was that like a
deliberate choice you made

9486
07:01:59,250 --> 07:02:01,259
that you're not gonna
let this keep you down?

9487
07:02:01,259 --> 07:02:02,669
- Yeah, a bit.

9488
07:02:02,669 --> 07:02:06,422
Also, like it's just kind of how I am.

9489
07:02:07,560 --> 07:02:09,510
Like I said, I roll with
the punches with everything.

9490
07:02:09,509 --> 07:02:11,639
I always used to tell people,

9491
07:02:11,639 --> 07:02:15,149
like I don't stress about things much.

9492
07:02:15,150 --> 07:02:17,400
And whenever I'd see
people getting stressed,

9493
07:02:17,400 --> 07:02:19,560
I would just say, "It's not hard.

9494
07:02:19,560 --> 07:02:21,450
Just don't stress about it."

9495
07:02:21,450 --> 07:02:24,150
And that's all you need to do.

9496
07:02:24,150 --> 07:02:26,559
And they're like, "That's
not how that works."

9497
07:02:26,559 --> 07:02:27,391
I'm like, "It works for me.

9498
07:02:27,391 --> 07:02:30,150
Like just don't stress, and
everything will be fine.

9499
07:02:30,150 --> 07:02:31,290
Like everything will work out."

9500
07:02:31,290 --> 07:02:34,370
Obviously, not everything
always goes well,

9501
07:02:34,369 --> 07:02:35,610
and it's not like it all works out

9502
07:02:35,610 --> 07:02:37,650
for the best all the time,

9503
07:02:37,650 --> 07:02:40,740
but I just don't think stress has had

9504
07:02:40,740 --> 07:02:43,173
any place in my life since I was a kid.

9505
07:02:44,310 --> 07:02:46,050
- What was the experience like

9506
07:02:46,049 --> 07:02:49,770
of you being selected to
be the first human being

9507
07:02:49,770 --> 07:02:52,319
to have a Neuralink device
implanted in your brain?

9508
07:02:53,383 --> 07:02:56,144
Were you scared, excited?
- No, no, it was cool.

9509
07:02:56,144 --> 07:02:58,173
(Lex laughing)

9510
07:02:58,173 --> 07:03:01,649
Like I was never afraid of it.

9511
07:03:01,650 --> 07:03:03,798
I had to think through a lot.

9512
07:03:03,797 --> 07:03:07,469
Should I do this?

9513
07:03:07,470 --> 07:03:09,270
Like be the first person?

9514
07:03:09,270 --> 07:03:12,209
I could wait until number two or three

9515
07:03:12,209 --> 07:03:14,759
and get a better version of the Neuralink.

9516
07:03:14,759 --> 07:03:16,859
Like the first one might not work.

9517
07:03:16,860 --> 07:03:20,712
Maybe it's actually gonna kind of suck it.

9518
07:03:21,930 --> 07:03:24,720
It's gonna be the worst
version ever in a person.

9519
07:03:24,720 --> 07:03:26,580
So why would I do the first one?

9520
07:03:26,580 --> 07:03:27,990
Like I've already kind of been selected.

9521
07:03:27,990 --> 07:03:30,690
I could just tell them, like,
"Okay, find someone else,

9522
07:03:30,689 --> 07:03:31,859
and then I'll do number two or three."

9523
07:03:31,860 --> 07:03:33,209
Like I'm sure they would let me.

9524
07:03:33,209 --> 07:03:35,189
They're looking for a few people anyways.

9525
07:03:35,189 --> 07:03:37,079
But ultimately, I was like, I don't know,

9526
07:03:37,080 --> 07:03:39,330
there's something about being
the first one to do something.

9527
07:03:39,330 --> 07:03:40,260
It's pretty cool.

9528
07:03:40,259 --> 07:03:43,500
I always thought that if I had the chance

9529
07:03:43,500 --> 07:03:46,233
that I would like to do
something for the first time,

9530
07:03:47,189 --> 07:03:49,340
this seemed like a
pretty good opportunity,

9531
07:03:50,189 --> 07:03:51,779
and I was never scared.

9532
07:03:51,779 --> 07:03:56,779
I think my like faith
had a huge part in that.

9533
07:03:57,569 --> 07:04:01,863
I always felt like God was
preparing me for something.

9534
07:04:02,880 --> 07:04:05,940
I almost wish it wasn't this,

9535
07:04:05,939 --> 07:04:09,119
because I had many conversations with God

9536
07:04:09,119 --> 07:04:12,840
about not wanting to do any
of this as a quadriplegic.

9537
07:04:12,840 --> 07:04:15,540
I told him, "I'll go
out and talk to people.

9538
07:04:15,540 --> 07:04:17,670
I'll go out and travel the world

9539
07:04:17,669 --> 07:04:21,000
and talk to stadiums, thousands of people,

9540
07:04:21,000 --> 07:04:22,919
give my testimony, I'll do all of it,

9541
07:04:22,919 --> 07:04:24,569
but like heal me first.

9542
07:04:24,569 --> 07:04:26,220
Don't make me do all of this in a chair.

9543
07:04:26,220 --> 07:04:27,266
That sucks."

9544
07:04:28,500 --> 07:04:31,560
And I guess he won that argument.

9545
07:04:31,560 --> 07:04:33,720
I didn't really have much of a choice.

9546
07:04:33,720 --> 07:04:37,710
I always felt like there
was something going on.

9547
07:04:37,709 --> 07:04:42,709
And to see how, I guess,
easily I made it through

9548
07:04:45,240 --> 07:04:46,560
the interview process

9549
07:04:46,560 --> 07:04:49,023
and how quickly everything happened,

9550
07:04:50,130 --> 07:04:53,043
how the stars sort of
aligned with all of this,

9551
07:04:54,840 --> 07:04:58,200
it just told me like, as the
surgery was getting closer,

9552
07:04:58,200 --> 07:05:02,670
it just told me that it
was all meant to happen.

9553
07:05:02,669 --> 07:05:03,899
It was all meant to be.

9554
07:05:03,900 --> 07:05:07,347
And so I shouldn't be afraid
of anything that's to come.

9555
07:05:07,347 --> 07:05:08,670
And so I wasn't.

9556
07:05:08,669 --> 07:05:10,143
I kept telling myself like,

9557
07:05:11,226 --> 07:05:14,039
"You say that now, but as
soon as the surgery comes,

9558
07:05:14,040 --> 07:05:15,690
you're probably gonna be freaking out.

9559
07:05:15,689 --> 07:05:17,099
Like you're about to have brain surgery."

9560
07:05:17,099 --> 07:05:21,239
And brain surgery is a big
deal for a lot of people,

9561
07:05:21,240 --> 07:05:23,310
but it's a even bigger deal for me.

9562
07:05:23,310 --> 07:05:24,780
Like it's all I have left.

9563
07:05:24,779 --> 07:05:26,287
The amount of times I've been like,

9564
07:05:26,287 --> 07:05:28,470
"Thank you God that you
didn't take my brain

9565
07:05:28,470 --> 07:05:31,740
and my personality and
my ability to think,

9566
07:05:31,740 --> 07:05:33,390
my like love of learning,

9567
07:05:33,389 --> 07:05:35,970
like my character, everything,
like thank you so much.

9568
07:05:35,970 --> 07:05:38,069
Like as long as you left me that,

9569
07:05:38,069 --> 07:05:39,509
then I think I can get by."

9570
07:05:39,509 --> 07:05:43,559
And I was about to let
people go like root around,

9571
07:05:43,560 --> 07:05:45,510
and they're like, "Hey, we're gonna go

9572
07:05:45,509 --> 07:05:46,739
put some stuff in your brain.

9573
07:05:46,740 --> 07:05:47,990
Hopefully, it works out."

9574
07:05:49,229 --> 07:05:51,779
And so it was something
that gave me pause.

9575
07:05:51,779 --> 07:05:54,869
But like I said, how
smoothly everything went,

9576
07:05:54,869 --> 07:05:58,709
I never expected for a second
that anything would go wrong.

9577
07:05:58,709 --> 07:06:02,700
Plus, the more people I
met on the Barrow's side

9578
07:06:02,700 --> 07:06:04,590
and on the Neuralink side,

9579
07:06:04,590 --> 07:06:06,869
they're just the most
impressive people in the world.

9580
07:06:06,869 --> 07:06:10,289
Like I can't speak enough

9581
07:06:10,290 --> 07:06:13,139
to how much I trust
these people with my life

9582
07:06:13,139 --> 07:06:16,766
and how impressed I am with all of them.

9583
07:06:16,766 --> 07:06:19,470
And to see the excitement on their faces,

9584
07:06:19,470 --> 07:06:24,150
to like walk into a room
and roll into a room

9585
07:06:24,150 --> 07:06:26,700
and see all of these people looking at me,

9586
07:06:26,700 --> 07:06:28,500
like we're so excited.

9587
07:06:28,500 --> 07:06:30,750
Like we've been working so hard on this,

9588
07:06:30,750 --> 07:06:32,159
and it's finally happening.

9589
07:06:32,159 --> 07:06:34,079
It's super infectious,

9590
07:06:34,080 --> 07:06:37,350
and it just makes me wanna do it even more

9591
07:06:37,349 --> 07:06:39,989
and to help them achieve their dreams.

9592
07:06:39,990 --> 07:06:42,600
Like I don't know, it's so rewarding.

9593
07:06:42,599 --> 07:06:45,239
And I'm so happy for
all of them, honestly.

9594
07:06:45,240 --> 07:06:47,463
- What was the day of surgery like?

9595
07:06:48,750 --> 07:06:49,889
When did you wake up?

9596
07:06:49,889 --> 07:06:51,569
What'd you feel?

9597
07:06:51,569 --> 07:06:53,069
- Yeah.
- Minute by minute.

9598
07:06:53,069 --> 07:06:54,147
- Yeah.
- Were you freaking out?

9599
07:06:54,147 --> 07:06:55,709
- No, no.

9600
07:06:55,709 --> 07:06:56,790
I thought I was going to,

9601
07:06:56,790 --> 07:06:59,130
but as surgery approached
the night before,

9602
07:06:59,130 --> 07:07:01,503
the morning of, I was just excited.

9603
07:07:02,610 --> 07:07:03,869
Let's make this happen.

9604
07:07:03,869 --> 07:07:06,450
I think I said something like that

9605
07:07:06,450 --> 07:07:08,549
to Elon on the phone beforehand.

9606
07:07:08,549 --> 07:07:10,319
We were like FaceTiming,

9607
07:07:10,319 --> 07:07:11,970
and I was like, "Let's rock and roll."

9608
07:07:11,970 --> 07:07:13,420
And he's like, "Let's do it."

9609
07:07:14,279 --> 07:07:16,829
I don't know, I wasn't scared.

9610
07:07:16,830 --> 07:07:17,760
So we woke up.

9611
07:07:17,759 --> 07:07:20,459
I think we had to be at the
hospital at like 5:30 AM.

9612
07:07:20,459 --> 07:07:22,709
I think surgery was at like 7:00 AM.

9613
07:07:22,709 --> 07:07:24,000
So we woke up pretty early.

9614
07:07:24,000 --> 07:07:27,122
I'm not sure much of us slept that night.

9615
07:07:30,209 --> 07:07:32,459
Got to the hospital 5:30,

9616
07:07:32,459 --> 07:07:35,669
went through like all the pre-op stuff.

9617
07:07:35,669 --> 07:07:37,799
Everyone was super nice.

9618
07:07:37,799 --> 07:07:40,380
Elon was supposed to be
there in the morning,

9619
07:07:40,380 --> 07:07:41,729
but something went wrong with his plane,

9620
07:07:41,729 --> 07:07:43,590
so we ended up FaceTiming.

9621
07:07:43,590 --> 07:07:44,422
That was cool.

9622
07:07:44,422 --> 07:07:47,159
Had one of the greatest
one-liners of my life.

9623
07:07:47,159 --> 07:07:49,590
After that phone call, hung up with him.

9624
07:07:49,590 --> 07:07:51,347
There were like 20 people
around me, and I was like,

9625
07:07:51,347 --> 07:07:54,420
I just hope he wasn't too
starstruck talking to me.

9626
07:07:54,419 --> 07:07:55,952
- Nice.
- Yeah, it was good.

9627
07:07:55,953 --> 07:07:57,690
- Well done.
- Yeah, yeah.

9628
07:07:57,689 --> 07:07:59,881
- Did you write that ahead of
time, or it just came to you?

9629
07:07:59,882 --> 07:08:00,873
- No, it just came to me.

9630
07:08:00,873 --> 07:08:03,537
I was like, "This seems right."

9631
07:08:04,799 --> 07:08:06,242
When in surgery,

9632
07:08:07,080 --> 07:08:09,480
I asked if I could pray right beforehand.

9633
07:08:09,479 --> 07:08:11,159
So I like prayed over the room.

9634
07:08:11,159 --> 07:08:13,439
I asked God if you would
like be with my mom

9635
07:08:13,439 --> 07:08:15,389
in case anything happened to me.

9636
07:08:15,389 --> 07:08:18,779
And just to like calm
her nerves out there.

9637
07:08:18,779 --> 07:08:22,979
Woke up and played a bit
of a prank on my mom.

9638
07:08:22,979 --> 07:08:23,992
I don't know if you've heard about it.

9639
07:08:23,992 --> 07:08:25,169
- Yeah, I read about it.

9640
07:08:25,169 --> 07:08:27,269
- Yeah, she was not happy.

9641
07:08:27,270 --> 07:08:29,400
- Can you take me through the prank

9642
07:08:29,400 --> 07:08:31,067
- Yeah, this is something-
- Do you regret

9643
07:08:31,066 --> 07:08:33,663
doing that now?
- No, no, not one bit.

9644
07:08:34,792 --> 07:08:37,950
It was something I had talked about

9645
07:08:37,950 --> 07:08:38,996
ahead of time with my buddy, Bain.

9646
07:08:38,996 --> 07:08:43,346
I was like, "I would really
like to play a prank on my mom."

9647
07:08:44,700 --> 07:08:46,260
Very specifically, my mom.

9648
07:08:46,259 --> 07:08:48,119
She's very gullible.

9649
07:08:48,119 --> 07:08:51,000
I think she had knee surgery once even.

9650
07:08:51,000 --> 07:08:54,122
And after she came out of knee surgery,

9651
07:08:55,709 --> 07:08:57,779
she was super groggy.

9652
07:08:57,779 --> 07:08:59,489
She's like, "I can't feel my legs."

9653
07:08:59,490 --> 07:09:01,387
And my dad looked at her, he was like,

9654
07:09:01,386 --> 07:09:02,699
"You don't have any legs.

9655
07:09:02,700 --> 07:09:05,787
Like they had to amputate both your legs."

9656
07:09:07,409 --> 07:09:11,092
We just do very mean
things to her all the time.

9657
07:09:11,092 --> 07:09:14,493
I'm so surprised that she still loves us.

9658
07:09:15,419 --> 07:09:18,196
But right after surgery,
I was really worried

9659
07:09:18,197 --> 07:09:22,080
that I was going to be too like
groggy, like not all there.

9660
07:09:22,080 --> 07:09:27,030
I had anesthesia once
before, and it messed me up.

9661
07:09:27,029 --> 07:09:30,809
Like I could not function
for a while afterwards.

9662
07:09:30,810 --> 07:09:35,400
And I like said a lot of
things that I was like,

9663
07:09:35,400 --> 07:09:38,159
I was really worried
that I was gonna start,

9664
07:09:38,159 --> 07:09:41,669
I don't know, like dropping some bombs.

9665
07:09:41,669 --> 07:09:44,759
And I wouldn't even know,
I wouldn't remember.

9666
07:09:44,759 --> 07:09:48,419
So I was like, "Please
God, don't let that happen.

9667
07:09:48,419 --> 07:09:52,556
And please let me be there
enough to do this to my mom."

9668
07:09:54,240 --> 07:09:58,140
And so she walked in after surgery.

9669
07:09:58,139 --> 07:09:59,309
It was like the first time

9670
07:09:59,310 --> 07:10:01,680
they had been able to
see me after surgery.

9671
07:10:01,680 --> 07:10:04,117
And she just looked at me, she said,

9672
07:10:04,116 --> 07:10:05,459
"Hi, like, how are you?

9673
07:10:05,459 --> 07:10:06,292
How are you doing?

9674
07:10:06,293 --> 07:10:07,126
How do you feel?"

9675
07:10:07,126 --> 07:10:09,720
And I looked at her in this very,

9676
07:10:09,720 --> 07:10:10,710
I think the anesthesia helped,

9677
07:10:10,709 --> 07:10:13,889
very like groggy, sort of
confused look on my face.

9678
07:10:13,889 --> 07:10:16,139
It's like, "Who are you?"

9679
07:10:16,139 --> 07:10:19,380
And she just started
looking around the room,

9680
07:10:19,380 --> 07:10:21,667
like at the surgeons,
at the doctors, like,

9681
07:10:21,667 --> 07:10:23,310
"What did you do to my son?

9682
07:10:23,310 --> 07:10:25,080
You need to fix this right now."

9683
07:10:25,080 --> 07:10:26,550
Tears started streaming.

9684
07:10:26,549 --> 07:10:28,259
I saw how much she was freaking out.

9685
07:10:28,259 --> 07:10:29,426
I was like, "I can't let this go on."

9686
07:10:29,426 --> 07:10:32,009
And so I was like, "Mom, I'm fine.

9687
07:10:32,009 --> 07:10:34,139
Like it's all right."

9688
07:10:34,139 --> 07:10:37,229
And still, she was not happy about it.

9689
07:10:37,229 --> 07:10:41,069
She still says she's
gonna get me back someday.

9690
07:10:41,069 --> 07:10:42,810
But I mean, I don't know.

9691
07:10:42,810 --> 07:10:44,819
I don't know what that's gonna look like.

9692
07:10:44,819 --> 07:10:47,632
- It's a lifelong battle.
- Yeah, it was good.

9693
07:10:47,633 --> 07:10:49,440
- In some sense, it was a demonstration

9694
07:10:49,439 --> 07:10:50,789
that you still got-

9695
07:10:50,790 --> 07:10:52,799
- That's all I wanted it to be
- Sense of humor.

9696
07:10:52,799 --> 07:10:53,994
- That's all I wanted it to be.

9697
07:10:53,994 --> 07:10:57,090
And I knew that doing
something super mean to her

9698
07:10:57,090 --> 07:10:59,549
like that would show her-
- -

9699
07:10:59,549 --> 07:11:00,382
- Yeah.
- To show that

9700
07:11:00,383 --> 07:11:01,980
you're still there, that you love her.

9701
07:11:01,979 --> 07:11:03,016
- [Noland] Yeah, exactly, exactly.

9702
07:11:03,016 --> 07:11:05,372
- It's a dark way to do it, but I love it.

9703
07:11:06,540 --> 07:11:09,690
What was the first time
you were able to feel

9704
07:11:09,689 --> 07:11:13,590
that you can use the Neuralink device

9705
07:11:13,590 --> 07:11:16,290
to effect the world around you?

9706
07:11:16,290 --> 07:11:18,659
- Yeah, the first little taste I got of it

9707
07:11:18,659 --> 07:11:22,619
was actually not too long after surgery.

9708
07:11:22,619 --> 07:11:24,849
Some of the Neuralink team had brought in

9709
07:11:26,250 --> 07:11:30,029
like a little iPad, a
little tablet screen,

9710
07:11:30,029 --> 07:11:34,119
and they had put up
eight different channels

9711
07:11:35,159 --> 07:11:38,520
that were recording some
of my neuron spikes.

9712
07:11:38,520 --> 07:11:39,389
They put it in front of me.

9713
07:11:39,389 --> 07:11:43,290
Like this is like real
time your brain firing.

9714
07:11:43,290 --> 07:11:44,282
That's super cool.

9715
07:11:46,110 --> 07:11:49,049
My first thought was, "I
mean, if they're firing now,

9716
07:11:49,049 --> 07:11:51,299
let's see if I can
affect them in some way."

9717
07:11:51,299 --> 07:11:53,790
So I started trying to
like wiggle my fingers

9718
07:11:53,790 --> 07:11:56,909
and I just started like
scanning through the channels,

9719
07:11:56,909 --> 07:11:58,590
and one of the things I was doing

9720
07:11:58,590 --> 07:12:01,020
was like moving my index
finger up and down.

9721
07:12:01,020 --> 07:12:04,560
And I just saw this yellow
spike on like top row,

9722
07:12:04,560 --> 07:12:06,750
like third box over or something.

9723
07:12:06,750 --> 07:12:08,819
I saw this yellow spike
every time I did it.

9724
07:12:08,819 --> 07:12:10,200
And I was like, "Oh, that's cool."

9725
07:12:10,200 --> 07:12:11,197
And everyone around me was just like,

9726
07:12:11,197 --> 07:12:12,220
"Well, what are you seeing?"

9727
07:12:12,220 --> 07:12:14,639
I was like, "Look, look at this one.

9728
07:12:14,639 --> 07:12:18,389
Look at like this top row, third
box over this yellow spike.

9729
07:12:18,389 --> 07:12:21,540
Like that's me right there, there, there."

9730
07:12:21,540 --> 07:12:23,250
And everyone was freaking out.

9731
07:12:23,250 --> 07:12:24,569
They started like clapping.

9732
07:12:24,569 --> 07:12:27,299
I was like, "That's super unnecessary."

9733
07:12:27,299 --> 07:12:28,132
- That's awesome.
- This is what's

9734
07:12:28,133 --> 07:12:29,760
supposed to happen, right?

9735
07:12:29,759 --> 07:12:32,459
- So you're imagining yourself moving

9736
07:12:32,459 --> 07:12:34,319
each individual finger one at a time,

9737
07:12:34,319 --> 07:12:37,073
and then seeing like that
you can notice something,

9738
07:12:37,073 --> 07:12:39,420
and then when you did the index
finger, you're like, "Oh."

9739
07:12:39,419 --> 07:12:42,659
- Yeah, I was wiggling
kind of all of my fingers

9740
07:12:42,659 --> 07:12:44,040
to see if anything would happen.

9741
07:12:44,040 --> 07:12:47,549
There was a lot of other things going on,

9742
07:12:47,549 --> 07:12:50,579
but that big yellow spike was
the one that stood out to me.

9743
07:12:50,580 --> 07:12:54,180
Like I'm sure that if I would've
stared at it long enough,

9744
07:12:54,180 --> 07:12:57,750
I could have mapped out
maybe 100 different things.

9745
07:12:57,750 --> 07:13:00,360
But the big yellow spike
was the one that I noticed.

9746
07:13:00,360 --> 07:13:02,010
- Maybe you could speak to what it's like

9747
07:13:02,009 --> 07:13:04,199
to sort of wiggle your fingers,

9748
07:13:04,200 --> 07:13:09,090
to imagine that the mental,
the cognitive effort required

9749
07:13:09,090 --> 07:13:11,849
to sort of wiggle your
index finger, for example.

9750
07:13:11,849 --> 07:13:13,049
How easy is that to do?

9751
07:13:13,049 --> 07:13:14,700
- Pretty easy for me.

9752
07:13:14,700 --> 07:13:18,360
It's something that,
at the very beginning,

9753
07:13:18,360 --> 07:13:21,630
after my accident, they told me to try

9754
07:13:21,630 --> 07:13:25,139
and move my body as much as possible.

9755
07:13:25,139 --> 07:13:29,279
Even if you can't, just keep trying,

9756
07:13:29,279 --> 07:13:32,250
because that's going to create
new like neural pathways

9757
07:13:32,250 --> 07:13:35,409
or pathways in my spinal cord
to like reconnect these things

9758
07:13:36,779 --> 07:13:39,270
to hopefully regain some movement someday.

9759
07:13:39,270 --> 07:13:40,677
- That's fascinating.
- Yeah, I know.

9760
07:13:40,677 --> 07:13:42,659
It's bizarre, but I-

9761
07:13:42,659 --> 07:13:44,650
- So that's part of the recovery process

9762
07:13:44,650 --> 07:13:46,650
is to keep trying to move your body?

9763
07:13:46,650 --> 07:13:49,377
- Yep, as much as you can.
- And that's,

9764
07:13:49,377 --> 07:13:51,360
and the nervous system does its thing.

9765
07:13:51,360 --> 07:13:52,440
It starts reconnecting.
- Yeah.

9766
07:13:52,439 --> 07:13:55,049
It'll start reconnecting for some people.

9767
07:13:55,049 --> 07:13:56,849
Some people, it never works.

9768
07:13:56,849 --> 07:13:58,049
Some people, they'll do it.

9769
07:13:58,049 --> 07:14:02,939
Like for me, I got some
bicep control back,

9770
07:14:02,939 --> 07:14:04,169
and that's about it.

9771
07:14:04,169 --> 07:14:08,699
I can, if I try enough,

9772
07:14:08,700 --> 07:14:10,799
I can wiggle some of my fingers.

9773
07:14:10,799 --> 07:14:12,869
Not like on command.

9774
07:14:12,869 --> 07:14:15,119
It's more like if I try to move,

9775
07:14:15,119 --> 07:14:18,329
say my right pinky and I
just keep trying to move it,

9776
07:14:18,330 --> 07:14:20,430
after a few seconds, it'll wiggle.

9777
07:14:20,430 --> 07:14:21,959
So I know there's stuff there.

9778
07:14:21,959 --> 07:14:24,456
Like I know, and that happens with a few

9779
07:14:24,456 --> 07:14:26,402
- -different of my fingers and stuff.

9780
07:14:28,229 --> 07:14:30,329
But yeah, that's what they tell you to do.

9781
07:14:31,349 --> 07:14:33,209
One of the people at the time

9782
07:14:33,209 --> 07:14:35,430
when I was in the hospital
came in and told me,

9783
07:14:35,430 --> 07:14:39,630
for one guy who had recovered
most of his control,

9784
07:14:39,630 --> 07:14:43,200
what he thought about every
day was actually walking,

9785
07:14:43,200 --> 07:14:46,650
like the act of walking
just over and over again.

9786
07:14:46,650 --> 07:14:48,659
So I tried that for years.

9787
07:14:48,659 --> 07:14:53,659
I tried just imagining
walking, which it's hard.

9788
07:14:54,000 --> 07:14:59,000
It's hard to imagine like all
of the steps that go into,

9789
07:15:00,060 --> 07:15:01,170
well, taking a step,

9790
07:15:01,169 --> 07:15:03,029
like all of the things that have to move,

9791
07:15:03,029 --> 07:15:06,569
like all of the activations
that have to happen

9792
07:15:06,569 --> 07:15:09,750
along your leg in order
for one step to occur.

9793
07:15:09,750 --> 07:15:11,340
- But you're not just imagining.

9794
07:15:11,340 --> 07:15:12,930
You're like doing it, right?

9795
07:15:12,930 --> 07:15:13,979
- I'm trying, yeah.

9796
07:15:13,979 --> 07:15:18,979
So it's like, it's imagining over again

9797
07:15:19,439 --> 07:15:21,869
what I had to do to take a step,

9798
07:15:21,869 --> 07:15:24,479
because it's not something
any of us think about.

9799
07:15:24,479 --> 07:15:26,819
You wanna walk and you take a step.

9800
07:15:26,819 --> 07:15:28,860
You don't think about all
of the different things

9801
07:15:28,860 --> 07:15:31,200
that are going on in your body.

9802
07:15:31,200 --> 07:15:34,947
So I had to recreate that in
my head as much as I could.

9803
07:15:34,947 --> 07:15:37,650
And then I practice it
over and over and over.

9804
07:15:37,650 --> 07:15:39,569
- So it's not like a
third person perspective.

9805
07:15:39,569 --> 07:15:41,159
It's a first person perspective.

9806
07:15:41,159 --> 07:15:42,389
You're like, it's not like

9807
07:15:42,389 --> 07:15:44,399
you're imagining yourself walking.

9808
07:15:44,400 --> 07:15:47,730
You're like literally
doing this, everything,

9809
07:15:47,729 --> 07:15:49,380
all the same stuff as if you're walking.

9810
07:15:49,380 --> 07:15:51,870
- Yeah, which was hard.

9811
07:15:51,869 --> 07:15:53,489
It was hard at the beginning.

9812
07:15:53,490 --> 07:15:54,630
- Like frustrating hard,

9813
07:15:54,630 --> 07:15:56,639
or like actually cognitively hard?

9814
07:15:56,639 --> 07:15:58,622
Like which way?
- It was both.

9815
07:16:02,939 --> 07:16:07,409
There's a scene in one of the
"Kill Bill" movies actually,

9816
07:16:07,409 --> 07:16:10,290
oddly enough, where she is like paralyzed,

9817
07:16:10,290 --> 07:16:12,690
I don't know, from like a
drug that was in her system.

9818
07:16:12,689 --> 07:16:14,909
And then she like finds some way to get

9819
07:16:14,909 --> 07:16:17,189
into the back of a truck or something,

9820
07:16:17,189 --> 07:16:20,699
and she stares at her
toe and she says, "Move."

9821
07:16:20,700 --> 07:16:22,409
Like move your big toe.

9822
07:16:22,409 --> 07:16:27,270
And after a few seconds
on screen, she does it.

9823
07:16:27,270 --> 07:16:29,909
And she did that with every
one of her like body parts

9824
07:16:29,909 --> 07:16:31,650
until she can move again.

9825
07:16:31,650 --> 07:16:36,650
I did that for years, just
stared at my body and said,

9826
07:16:36,906 --> 07:16:38,430
"Move your index finger.

9827
07:16:38,430 --> 07:16:39,836
Move your big toe."

9828
07:16:40,709 --> 07:16:43,079
Sometimes, vocalizing it like out loud,

9829
07:16:43,080 --> 07:16:44,370
sometimes just thinking it.

9830
07:16:44,369 --> 07:16:47,279
I tried every different way to do this

9831
07:16:47,279 --> 07:16:49,289
to try to get some movement back.

9832
07:16:49,290 --> 07:16:54,290
And it's hard because it
actually is like taxing,

9833
07:16:54,330 --> 07:16:56,640
like physically taxing on my body,

9834
07:16:56,639 --> 07:16:58,559
which is something I
would've never expected,

9835
07:16:58,560 --> 07:17:00,150
'cause it's not like I'm moving,

9836
07:17:00,150 --> 07:17:05,150
but it feels like there's
a buildup of, I don't know,

9837
07:17:05,610 --> 07:17:10,610
the only way I can describe
it is there are like signals

9838
07:17:10,709 --> 07:17:14,759
that aren't getting
through from my brain down,

9839
07:17:14,759 --> 07:17:17,009
'cause there's that gap in my spinal cord.

9840
07:17:17,009 --> 07:17:21,359
So brain down, and then from
my hand back up to the brain.

9841
07:17:21,360 --> 07:17:24,040
And so it feels like those signals

9842
07:17:25,080 --> 07:17:28,530
get stuck in whatever body
part that I'm trying to move.

9843
07:17:28,529 --> 07:17:30,239
And they just build up and build up

9844
07:17:30,240 --> 07:17:32,190
and build up until they burst.

9845
07:17:32,189 --> 07:17:35,639
And then once they burst, I
get like this really weird

9846
07:17:35,639 --> 07:17:38,700
sensation of everything
sort of like dissipating

9847
07:17:38,700 --> 07:17:41,073
back out to level, and then I do it again.

9848
07:17:42,599 --> 07:17:46,889
It's also just like a fatigue
thing, like a muscle fatigue,

9849
07:17:46,889 --> 07:17:49,380
but without actually moving your muscles.

9850
07:17:49,380 --> 07:17:51,090
It's very, very bizarre.

9851
07:17:51,090 --> 07:17:55,590
And then if you try to
stare at a body part

9852
07:17:55,590 --> 07:17:56,759
or think about a body part

9853
07:17:56,759 --> 07:18:01,619
and move for two, three,
four, sometimes eight hours,

9854
07:18:01,619 --> 07:18:04,259
it's very taxing on your mind.

9855
07:18:04,259 --> 07:18:06,122
It's takes a lot of focus.

9856
07:18:07,259 --> 07:18:09,239
It was a lot easier at the beginning

9857
07:18:09,240 --> 07:18:13,860
because I wasn't able to like control a TV

9858
07:18:13,860 --> 07:18:14,850
in my room or anything.

9859
07:18:14,849 --> 07:18:18,359
I wasn't able to control
any of my environment.

9860
07:18:18,360 --> 07:18:20,430
So for the first few years,

9861
07:18:20,430 --> 07:18:23,310
a lot of what I was doing
was staring at walls.

9862
07:18:23,310 --> 07:18:27,780
And so obviously, I did a lot of thinking,

9863
07:18:27,779 --> 07:18:32,340
and I tried to move a lot just
over and over and over again.

9864
07:18:32,340 --> 07:18:35,246
- So you never gave up sort of hope there?

9865
07:18:35,246 --> 07:18:37,110
- No.
- Just training hard

9866
07:18:37,110 --> 07:18:39,209
essentially?
- Yep, and I still do it.

9867
07:18:39,209 --> 07:18:42,000
I do it like subconsciously.

9868
07:18:42,000 --> 07:18:45,750
And I think that that helped a lot

9869
07:18:45,750 --> 07:18:47,790
with things with Neuralink, honestly.

9870
07:18:47,790 --> 07:18:50,069
It's something that I
talked about the other day

9871
07:18:50,069 --> 07:18:53,669
at the all hands that I did at
Neuralink's Austin facility.

9872
07:18:53,669 --> 07:18:54,719
- Welcome to Austin, by the way.

9873
07:18:54,720 --> 07:18:55,830
- Yeah, hey, thanks man.

9874
07:18:55,830 --> 07:18:56,883
I went to school-
- Nice hat.

9875
07:18:56,883 --> 07:18:58,110
- Hey, thanks, thanks man.

9876
07:18:58,110 --> 07:19:00,299
The gigafactory was super cool.

9877
07:19:00,299 --> 07:19:01,559
I went to school at Texas A&M,

9878
07:19:01,560 --> 07:19:03,330
so I've been around before.

9879
07:19:03,330 --> 07:19:05,040
- So you should be saying welcome to me.

9880
07:19:05,040 --> 07:19:06,389
- Yeah.
- Welcome to Texas, Lex.

9881
07:19:06,389 --> 07:19:07,922
Yeah, I get you.

9882
07:19:08,970 --> 07:19:11,010
- But yeah, I was talking about how

9883
07:19:11,009 --> 07:19:12,840
a lot of what they've had me do,

9884
07:19:12,840 --> 07:19:14,310
especially at the beginning,

9885
07:19:14,310 --> 07:19:17,460
well, I still do it now is body mapping.

9886
07:19:17,459 --> 07:19:21,840
So like there will be a
visualization of a hand

9887
07:19:21,840 --> 07:19:25,680
or an arm on the screen and
I have to do that motion,

9888
07:19:25,680 --> 07:19:29,369
and that's how they sort
of train the algorithm

9889
07:19:29,369 --> 07:19:31,950
to like understand what I'm trying to do.

9890
07:19:31,950 --> 07:19:36,950
And so it made things very
seamless for me, I think.

9891
07:19:38,279 --> 07:19:39,299
- That's really, really cool.

9892
07:19:39,299 --> 07:19:41,040
So yeah, it's amazing to know

9893
07:19:41,040 --> 07:19:43,959
'cause I've learned a lot about
the body mapping procedure

9894
07:19:45,625 --> 07:19:46,799
with the interface and
everything like that.

9895
07:19:46,799 --> 07:19:48,930
It's cool to know that
you've been essentially

9896
07:19:48,930 --> 07:19:52,966
like training to be like
world class at that task.

9897
07:19:52,966 --> 07:19:54,543
- Yeah, yeah.

9898
07:19:55,986 --> 07:19:58,229
I don't know if other quadriplegics,

9899
07:19:58,229 --> 07:20:00,840
like other paralyzed people give up.

9900
07:20:00,840 --> 07:20:03,450
I hope they don't.

9901
07:20:03,450 --> 07:20:05,010
I hope they keep trying,

9902
07:20:05,009 --> 07:20:09,000
because I've heard other
paralyzed people say,

9903
07:20:09,000 --> 07:20:10,169
like don't ever stop.

9904
07:20:10,169 --> 07:20:14,759
They tell you two years,
but you just never know.

9905
07:20:14,759 --> 07:20:17,789
The human body is capable
of amazing things.

9906
07:20:17,790 --> 07:20:21,810
So I've heard other people
say, "Don't give up."

9907
07:20:21,810 --> 07:20:25,590
Like I think one girl had spoken to me

9908
07:20:25,590 --> 07:20:26,790
through some family members

9909
07:20:26,790 --> 07:20:30,750
and said that she had been
paralyzed for 18 years,

9910
07:20:30,750 --> 07:20:33,990
and she'd been trying to
like wiggle her index finger

9911
07:20:33,990 --> 07:20:36,360
for all that time, and
she finally got it back

9912
07:20:36,360 --> 07:20:37,799
like 18 years later.

9913
07:20:37,799 --> 07:20:39,809
So like I know that it's possible,

9914
07:20:39,810 --> 07:20:42,030
and I'll never give up doing it.

9915
07:20:42,029 --> 07:20:43,709
I do it when I'm lying down.

9916
07:20:43,709 --> 07:20:45,899
Like watching TV, I'll
find myself doing it,

9917
07:20:45,900 --> 07:20:48,750
kind of just almost like on its own.

9918
07:20:48,750 --> 07:20:51,029
It's just something I've
gotten so used to doing

9919
07:20:51,029 --> 07:20:53,969
that I don't know, I don't
think I'll ever stop.

9920
07:20:53,970 --> 07:20:54,960
- That's really awesome to hear,

9921
07:20:54,959 --> 07:20:56,250
'cause I think it's one of those things

9922
07:20:56,250 --> 07:20:58,974
that can really pay off, in the long term.

9923
07:20:58,974 --> 07:21:00,119
'Cause like that is training.

9924
07:21:00,119 --> 07:21:01,590
You're not visibly seeing the results

9925
07:21:01,590 --> 07:21:03,599
of that training at the moment, but like,

9926
07:21:03,599 --> 07:21:06,419
there's that like Olympic
level nervous system

9927
07:21:06,419 --> 07:21:08,669
getting ready for something.
- Which honestly

9928
07:21:08,669 --> 07:21:13,379
was like something that
I think Neuralink gave me

9929
07:21:13,380 --> 07:21:17,880
that I can't thank them enough for it.

9930
07:21:17,880 --> 07:21:20,670
Like I can't show my
appreciation for it enough

9931
07:21:20,669 --> 07:21:25,669
was being able to visually see

9932
07:21:25,830 --> 07:21:30,423
that what I'm doing is
actually having some effect.

9933
07:21:31,409 --> 07:21:34,770
It's a huge part of the reason why,

9934
07:21:34,770 --> 07:21:38,430
like I know now that I'm
gonna keep doing it forever,

9935
07:21:38,430 --> 07:21:42,450
because before Neuralink,
I was doing it every day,

9936
07:21:42,450 --> 07:21:46,619
and I was just assuming
that things were happening.

9937
07:21:46,619 --> 07:21:47,639
Like it's not like I knew.

9938
07:21:47,639 --> 07:21:52,619
I wasn't getting back any
mobility or sensation or anything.

9939
07:21:52,619 --> 07:21:54,599
So I could have been running up

9940
07:21:54,599 --> 07:21:56,759
against a brick wall for all I knew.

9941
07:21:56,759 --> 07:21:59,849
And with Neuralink, I get to see

9942
07:21:59,849 --> 07:22:02,609
like all the signals happen in real time,

9943
07:22:02,610 --> 07:22:06,209
and I get to see that

9944
07:22:06,209 --> 07:22:09,239
what I'm doing can actually be mapped.

9945
07:22:09,240 --> 07:22:11,700
When we started doing like
click calibrations and stuff,

9946
07:22:11,700 --> 07:22:14,430
when I go to click my index
finger for a left click,

9947
07:22:14,430 --> 07:22:16,802
that it actually recognizes that.

9948
07:22:16,802 --> 07:22:21,270
Like it changed how I
think about what's possible

9949
07:22:21,270 --> 07:22:25,020
with like retraining my body to move.

9950
07:22:25,020 --> 07:22:28,020
And so yeah, I'll never give up now.

9951
07:22:28,020 --> 07:22:30,450
- And also, just the signal
that there's still a powerhouse

9952
07:22:30,450 --> 07:22:32,372
of a brain there that's like-

9953
07:22:32,372 --> 07:22:34,409
- Exactly.
- And as the technology

9954
07:22:34,409 --> 07:22:35,939
develops, that brain is,

9955
07:22:35,939 --> 07:22:37,409
I mean, that's the most important thing

9956
07:22:37,409 --> 07:22:38,656
about the human body is the brain.

9957
07:22:38,656 --> 07:22:40,909
And it can do a lot of the control.

9958
07:22:40,909 --> 07:22:42,869
So what did it feel like when you first,

9959
07:22:42,869 --> 07:22:44,099
could wiggle the index finger

9960
07:22:44,099 --> 07:22:46,709
and saw the environment respond?

9961
07:22:46,709 --> 07:22:49,110
Like that little-
- Yeah.

9962
07:22:49,110 --> 07:22:51,270
- Wherever, just being way
too dramatic according to you.

9963
07:22:51,270 --> 07:22:52,500
- Yeah, it was very cool.

9964
07:22:52,500 --> 07:22:56,490
I mean, it was cool, but I
keep telling this to people,

9965
07:22:56,490 --> 07:22:58,050
it made sense to me.

9966
07:22:58,049 --> 07:22:59,529
Like it made sense that

9967
07:23:00,498 --> 07:23:03,779
like there are signals
still happening in my brain,

9968
07:23:03,779 --> 07:23:07,259
and that as long as you
had something near it

9969
07:23:07,259 --> 07:23:09,689
that could measure those,
that could record those,

9970
07:23:09,689 --> 07:23:12,989
then you should be able to
visualize it in some way.

9971
07:23:12,990 --> 07:23:14,370
Like see it happen.

9972
07:23:14,369 --> 07:23:17,020
And so that was not very surprising to me.

9973
07:23:17,020 --> 07:23:19,229
I was just like, "Oh, cool."

9974
07:23:19,229 --> 07:23:20,369
We found one.

9975
07:23:20,369 --> 07:23:22,119
Like we found something that works.

9976
07:23:23,009 --> 07:23:26,039
It was cool to see that
their technology worked,

9977
07:23:26,040 --> 07:23:28,680
and that everything that
they had worked so hard for

9978
07:23:28,680 --> 07:23:30,869
was like going to pay off.

9979
07:23:30,869 --> 07:23:33,209
But I hadn't like moved a cursor
or anything at that point.

9980
07:23:33,209 --> 07:23:35,069
I had like interacted with a computer

9981
07:23:35,069 --> 07:23:36,369
or anything at that point.

9982
07:23:37,409 --> 07:23:41,073
So it just made sense, it was cool.

9983
07:23:42,299 --> 07:23:45,809
I didn't really know much
about BCI at that point either,

9984
07:23:45,810 --> 07:23:48,870
so I didn't know like what sort of step

9985
07:23:48,869 --> 07:23:50,969
this was actually making.

9986
07:23:50,970 --> 07:23:54,060
Like I didn't know if
this was like a huge deal,

9987
07:23:54,060 --> 07:23:55,170
or if this was just like,

9988
07:23:55,169 --> 07:23:58,559
okay, it's cool that we got this far,

9989
07:23:58,560 --> 07:24:00,240
but we're actually hoping

9990
07:24:00,240 --> 07:24:02,220
for something like much
better down the road.

9991
07:24:02,220 --> 07:24:03,060
It's like, okay.

9992
07:24:03,060 --> 07:24:06,150
I just thought that they
knew that it turned on.

9993
07:24:06,150 --> 07:24:07,470
So I was like, cool.

9994
07:24:07,470 --> 07:24:08,608
Like this is cool.

9995
07:24:08,608 --> 07:24:10,380
- Well, did you like read up on the specs

9996
07:24:10,380 --> 07:24:11,909
of the hardware you're getting installed?

9997
07:24:11,909 --> 07:24:14,075
Like the number of threads,

9998
07:24:14,075 --> 07:24:15,209
this kind of stuff?
- Yeah, I do all of that,

9999
07:24:15,209 --> 07:24:17,239
but it's all Greek to me.

10000
07:24:17,240 --> 07:24:20,880
I was like, okay, threads, 64 threads,

10001
07:24:20,880 --> 07:24:24,032
16 electrodes, 1,024 channels.

10002
07:24:24,900 --> 07:24:26,512
Okay.

10003
07:24:26,511 --> 07:24:29,042
Like that math checks out.

10004
07:24:30,599 --> 07:24:32,009
- Sounds right.
- Yeah.

10005
07:24:32,009 --> 07:24:32,842
- When was the first time

10006
07:24:32,843 --> 07:24:34,470
you were able to move a mouse cursor?

10007
07:24:34,470 --> 07:24:37,710
- I know it must have been
within the first maybe week,

10008
07:24:37,709 --> 07:24:39,719
a week or two weeks that I was able

10009
07:24:39,720 --> 07:24:42,270
to like first move the cursor.

10010
07:24:42,270 --> 07:24:46,409
And again, like it kind
of made sense to me.

10011
07:24:46,409 --> 07:24:48,722
It didn't seem like that big of a deal.

10012
07:24:50,098 --> 07:24:52,173
It was like, okay, well,

10013
07:24:52,172 --> 07:24:54,959
hmm, how do I explain this?

10014
07:24:54,959 --> 07:24:57,029
When everyone around you starts clapping

10015
07:24:57,029 --> 07:25:01,356
for something that you've
done, it's easy to say,

10016
07:25:01,356 --> 07:25:03,810
"Okay, like I did something cool.

10017
07:25:03,810 --> 07:25:07,110
Like that was impressive in some way."

10018
07:25:07,110 --> 07:25:09,810
What exactly that meant, what it was

10019
07:25:09,810 --> 07:25:13,953
hadn't really like set in for me.

10020
07:25:14,939 --> 07:25:19,939
So again, I knew that me
trying to move a body part

10021
07:25:24,029 --> 07:25:29,029
and then that being mapped
in some sort of like

10022
07:25:29,400 --> 07:25:34,020
machine learning algorithm
to be able to identify

10023
07:25:34,020 --> 07:25:35,850
like my brain signals and then take that

10024
07:25:35,849 --> 07:25:37,349
and give me cursor control,

10025
07:25:37,349 --> 07:25:38,819
that all kind of made sense to me.

10026
07:25:38,819 --> 07:25:41,279
I don't know like all
the ins and outs of it,

10027
07:25:41,279 --> 07:25:44,549
but I was like, there are still
signals in my brain firing.

10028
07:25:44,549 --> 07:25:45,959
They just can't get through

10029
07:25:45,959 --> 07:25:49,049
because there's like a
gap in my spinal cord.

10030
07:25:49,049 --> 07:25:51,869
And so they can't get all
the way down and back up,

10031
07:25:51,869 --> 07:25:53,459
but they're still there.

10032
07:25:53,459 --> 07:25:56,616
So when I moved the cursor for
the first time, I was like,

10033
07:25:56,616 --> 07:26:00,029
"That's cool, but I expected
that that should happen."

10034
07:26:00,029 --> 07:26:01,712
Like it made sense to me.

10035
07:26:02,909 --> 07:26:06,279
When I moved the cursor for the first time

10036
07:26:07,380 --> 07:26:10,770
with just my mind, without
like physically trying to move,

10037
07:26:10,770 --> 07:26:12,810
so I guess I can get into
that just a little bit.

10038
07:26:12,810 --> 07:26:14,580
Like the difference between

10039
07:26:14,580 --> 07:26:16,530
attempted movement and imagined movement.

10040
07:26:16,529 --> 07:26:18,270
- Yeah, that's a fascinating difference.

10041
07:26:18,270 --> 07:26:19,150
- Yeah.
- From one to the other.

10042
07:26:19,150 --> 07:26:20,460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10043
07:26:20,459 --> 07:26:24,899
So like attempted movement
is me physically trying

10044
07:26:24,900 --> 07:26:28,110
to attempt to move, say, my hand.

10045
07:26:28,110 --> 07:26:30,299
I try to attempt to move
my hand to the right,

10046
07:26:30,299 --> 07:26:32,042
to the left, forward and back.

10047
07:26:33,090 --> 07:26:33,959
And that's all attempted.

10048
07:26:33,959 --> 07:26:37,349
Attempt to like lift
my finger up and down.

10049
07:26:37,349 --> 07:26:39,750
Attempt to kick or something.

10050
07:26:39,750 --> 07:26:42,360
I'm physically trying to
do all of those things,

10051
07:26:42,360 --> 07:26:44,433
even if you can't see it.

10052
07:26:45,299 --> 07:26:46,860
This would be like me attempting

10053
07:26:46,860 --> 07:26:49,290
to like shrug my shoulders or something.

10054
07:26:49,290 --> 07:26:50,793
That's all attempted movement.

10055
07:26:54,029 --> 07:26:57,329
That's what I was doing for
the first couple of weeks

10056
07:26:57,330 --> 07:27:00,240
when they were going to
give me cursor control.

10057
07:27:00,240 --> 07:27:01,620
When I was doing body mapping,

10058
07:27:01,619 --> 07:27:04,739
it was attempt to do
this, attempt to do that.

10059
07:27:04,740 --> 07:27:09,740
When Nir was telling me
to like imagine doing it,

10060
07:27:12,419 --> 07:27:14,939
it like kind of made sense to me,

10061
07:27:14,939 --> 07:27:19,590
but it's not something
that people practice.

10062
07:27:19,590 --> 07:27:24,590
Like if you started school
as a child and they said,

10063
07:27:26,557 --> 07:27:28,830
"Okay, write your name with this pencil."

10064
07:27:28,830 --> 07:27:30,127
And so you do that.

10065
07:27:30,127 --> 07:27:33,180
"Okay, now imagine writing
your name with that pencil."

10066
07:27:33,180 --> 07:27:35,340
Kids would think like,

10067
07:27:35,340 --> 07:27:38,009
I guess like that kind of makes sense.

10068
07:27:38,009 --> 07:27:39,269
And they would do it.

10069
07:27:39,270 --> 07:27:40,920
But that's not something we're taught.

10070
07:27:40,919 --> 07:27:43,409
It's all like how to do things physically.

10071
07:27:43,409 --> 07:27:46,470
We think about like thought
experiments and things,

10072
07:27:46,470 --> 07:27:50,159
but that's not like a physical
action of doing things.

10073
07:27:50,159 --> 07:27:53,159
It's more like what you would
do in certain situations.

10074
07:27:53,159 --> 07:27:56,400
So imagined movement, it never
really connected with me.

10075
07:27:56,400 --> 07:27:59,280
Like I guess you could maybe describe it

10076
07:27:59,279 --> 07:28:01,289
as like a professional athlete,

10077
07:28:01,290 --> 07:28:04,740
like swinging a baseball bat
or swinging like a golf club.

10078
07:28:04,740 --> 07:28:06,840
Like imagine what you're supposed to do.

10079
07:28:06,840 --> 07:28:10,832
But then you go right to
that and physically do it,

10080
07:28:11,700 --> 07:28:13,049
then you get a bat in your hand

10081
07:28:13,049 --> 07:28:14,866
and then you do what
you've been imagining.

10082
07:28:14,866 --> 07:28:17,219
And so I don't have that like connection.

10083
07:28:17,220 --> 07:28:20,760
So telling me to imagine
something versus attempting it,

10084
07:28:20,759 --> 07:28:24,479
there wasn't a lot that I
could do there mentally.

10085
07:28:24,479 --> 07:28:28,742
I just kind of had to accept
what was going on and try.

10086
07:28:30,180 --> 07:28:32,610
But the attempted moving
thing, it all made sense to me.

10087
07:28:32,610 --> 07:28:34,770
Like if I try to move,

10088
07:28:34,770 --> 07:28:38,159
then there's a signal
being sent in my brain.

10089
07:28:38,159 --> 07:28:39,750
And as long as they can pick that up,

10090
07:28:39,750 --> 07:28:42,720
then they should be able to map
it to what I'm trying to do.

10091
07:28:42,720 --> 07:28:45,450
And so when I first moved
the cursor like that,

10092
07:28:45,450 --> 07:28:48,750
it was just like, "Yes,
this should happen."

10093
07:28:48,750 --> 07:28:50,759
Like I'm not surprised by that.

10094
07:28:50,759 --> 07:28:52,919
- But can you clarify, is there
supposed to be a difference

10095
07:28:52,919 --> 07:28:55,379
between imagined movement
and attempted movement?

10096
07:28:55,380 --> 07:28:57,510
- Yeah, just that in imagined movement,

10097
07:28:57,509 --> 07:29:00,002
you're not attempting to move at all.

10098
07:29:01,021 --> 07:29:03,150
- You're like visualizing doing.

10099
07:29:03,150 --> 07:29:06,300
And then theoretically, is
that supposed to be a different

10100
07:29:06,299 --> 07:29:07,559
part of the brain that lights up

10101
07:29:07,560 --> 07:29:09,240
in those two different situations?

10102
07:29:09,240 --> 07:29:10,380
- [Bliss] Yeah, not necessarily.

10103
07:29:10,380 --> 07:29:12,389
I think all these signals
can still be represented

10104
07:29:12,389 --> 07:29:15,062
in motor cortex, but the
difference I think has to do

10105
07:29:15,062 --> 07:29:17,429
with the naturalness
of imagining something

10106
07:29:17,430 --> 07:29:19,166
versus attempting it-
- Got it.

10107
07:29:19,166 --> 07:29:20,670
- [Bliss] And sort of the
fatigue of that over time.

10108
07:29:20,669 --> 07:29:23,012
- And by the way, on the mic is Bliss.

10109
07:29:25,049 --> 07:29:27,750
So this is just different
ways to prompt you

10110
07:29:27,750 --> 07:29:30,669
to kind of get to the
thing that you arrived at.

10111
07:29:30,669 --> 07:29:31,709
- [Noland] Yeah, yeah.

10112
07:29:31,709 --> 07:29:35,729
- Attempted movement does sound
like the right thing - try.

10113
07:29:35,729 --> 07:29:37,709
- Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me.

10114
07:29:37,709 --> 07:29:40,829
- 'Cause imagine for me,
I would start visualizing,

10115
07:29:40,830 --> 07:29:42,780
like in my mind, visualizing.

10116
07:29:42,779 --> 07:29:45,547
Attempted, I would actually
start trying to like,

10117
07:29:45,547 --> 07:29:46,663
there's, I mean,

10118
07:29:46,663 --> 07:29:49,290
I did like combat sports my
whole life, like wrestling.

10119
07:29:49,290 --> 07:29:54,290
When I'm imagining a move,
see, I'm like moving my muscle.

10120
07:29:54,630 --> 07:29:56,330
- Exactly.
- Like there is a bit

10121
07:29:56,330 --> 07:29:59,730
of an activation almost,
versus like visualizing

10122
07:29:59,729 --> 07:30:01,619
yourself like a picture doing it.

10123
07:30:01,619 --> 07:30:03,479
- Yeah, it's something that

10124
07:30:03,479 --> 07:30:05,520
I feel like naturally, anyone would do.

10125
07:30:05,520 --> 07:30:07,889
If you try to tell someone
to imagine doing something,

10126
07:30:07,889 --> 07:30:09,329
they might close their eyes

10127
07:30:09,330 --> 07:30:11,880
and then start physically doing it.

10128
07:30:11,880 --> 07:30:14,400
But it's just-
- Just didn't click.

10129
07:30:14,400 --> 07:30:15,512
- Yeah.

10130
07:30:15,511 --> 07:30:17,669
It's hard.

10131
07:30:17,669 --> 07:30:18,809
It was very hard at the beginning.

10132
07:30:18,810 --> 07:30:21,090
- But attempted worked.
- Attempted worked.

10133
07:30:21,090 --> 07:30:23,282
It worked just like it should.

10134
07:30:24,837 --> 07:30:26,610
Worked like a charm.

10135
07:30:26,610 --> 07:30:27,990
- [Bliss] I remember
there was like one Tuesday

10136
07:30:27,990 --> 07:30:29,850
we were messing around, and I think,

10137
07:30:29,849 --> 07:30:31,169
I forget what swear word you used,

10138
07:30:31,169 --> 07:30:32,819
but there's a swear word
that came out of your mouth

10139
07:30:32,819 --> 07:30:33,930
when you figured out you could just do

10140
07:30:33,930 --> 07:30:35,369
the direct cursor control.

10141
07:30:35,369 --> 07:30:37,799
- Yeah, that's it.

10142
07:30:37,799 --> 07:30:39,899
It blew my mind.

10143
07:30:39,900 --> 07:30:43,840
Like no pun intended,
blew my mind when I first

10144
07:30:45,509 --> 07:30:49,139
moved the cursor just with my thoughts

10145
07:30:49,139 --> 07:30:51,869
and not attempting to move.

10146
07:30:51,869 --> 07:30:53,379
It's something that I've found

10147
07:30:54,659 --> 07:30:57,602
like over the couple of weeks,
like building up to that,

10148
07:30:58,560 --> 07:31:02,400
that as I get better cursor controls,

10149
07:31:02,400 --> 07:31:05,163
like the model gets better,

10150
07:31:06,630 --> 07:31:11,433
then it gets easier for me to like,

10151
07:31:12,512 --> 07:31:15,869
like I don't have to
attempt as much to move it.

10152
07:31:15,869 --> 07:31:19,200
And part of that is something
that I'd even talked

10153
07:31:19,200 --> 07:31:23,639
with them about when I
was watching the signals

10154
07:31:23,639 --> 07:31:26,520
of my brain one day, I was watching,

10155
07:31:26,520 --> 07:31:29,189
when I like attempted to move to the right

10156
07:31:29,189 --> 07:31:33,143
and I watched the screen,
it's like I saw the spikes.

10157
07:31:33,143 --> 07:31:35,759
It's like I was seeing the
spike, the signals being sent

10158
07:31:35,759 --> 07:31:38,522
before I was actually attempting to move.

10159
07:31:39,689 --> 07:31:44,369
I imagined just because when
you go to say move your hand

10160
07:31:44,369 --> 07:31:46,590
or any body part, that signal gets sent

10161
07:31:46,590 --> 07:31:48,000
before you're actually moving

10162
07:31:48,000 --> 07:31:50,189
has to make it all the
way down and back up

10163
07:31:50,189 --> 07:31:51,899
before you actually do
any sort of movement.

10164
07:31:51,900 --> 07:31:53,730
So there's a delay there.

10165
07:31:53,729 --> 07:31:58,110
And I noticed that there was
something going on in my brain

10166
07:31:58,110 --> 07:32:00,630
before I was actually attempting to move,

10167
07:32:00,630 --> 07:32:05,630
that my brain was like
anticipating what I wanted to do.

10168
07:32:06,869 --> 07:32:09,362
And that all started sort of,

10169
07:32:11,459 --> 07:32:13,726
I don't know, like
percolating in my brain.

10170
07:32:13,726 --> 07:32:16,200
It was just sort of there,

10171
07:32:16,200 --> 07:32:17,430
like always in the back.

10172
07:32:17,430 --> 07:32:20,490
Like that's so weird
that it could do that.

10173
07:32:20,490 --> 07:32:24,330
It kind of makes sense, but
I wonder what that means

10174
07:32:24,330 --> 07:32:26,313
as far as like using the Neuralink.

10175
07:32:29,250 --> 07:32:32,939
And then as I was playing around
with the attempted movement

10176
07:32:32,939 --> 07:32:34,349
and playing around with the cursor,

10177
07:32:34,349 --> 07:32:37,289
and I saw that like, as the
cursor control got better,

10178
07:32:37,290 --> 07:32:42,290
that it was anticipating my movements

10179
07:32:42,569 --> 07:32:44,159
and what I wanted it to do.

10180
07:32:44,159 --> 07:32:45,329
Like cursor movements,

10181
07:32:45,330 --> 07:32:48,240
what I wanted to do a bit
better and a bit better.

10182
07:32:48,240 --> 07:32:51,750
And then one day, I just randomly,

10183
07:32:51,750 --> 07:32:56,750
as I was playing Webgrid,
I like looked at a target

10184
07:32:57,209 --> 07:32:59,729
before I had started
like attempting to move.

10185
07:32:59,729 --> 07:33:01,529
I was just trying to like get over,

10186
07:33:01,529 --> 07:33:05,399
like train my eyes to start looking ahead.

10187
07:33:05,400 --> 07:33:07,319
Like, okay, this is the target I'm on,

10188
07:33:07,319 --> 07:33:09,209
but if I look over here to this target,

10189
07:33:09,209 --> 07:33:12,000
I know I can like maybe be
a bit quicker getting there.

10190
07:33:12,000 --> 07:33:14,742
And I looked over and the
cursor just shot over it.

10191
07:33:15,659 --> 07:33:17,490
It was wild.

10192
07:33:17,490 --> 07:33:19,200
I had to take a step back.

10193
07:33:19,200 --> 07:33:21,240
Like I was like, "This
should not be happening."

10194
07:33:21,240 --> 07:33:24,030
All day, I was just
smiling, I was so giddy.

10195
07:33:24,029 --> 07:33:25,832
I was like, "Guys, do
you know that this works?

10196
07:33:25,832 --> 07:33:28,439
Like I can just think it and it happens,"

10197
07:33:28,439 --> 07:33:31,619
which like they'd all been
saying this entire time.

10198
07:33:31,619 --> 07:33:32,669
like I can't believe

10199
07:33:32,669 --> 07:33:34,226
like you're doing all this with your mind.

10200
07:33:34,226 --> 07:33:36,512
I'm like, "Yeah, but is
it really with my mind?"

10201
07:33:36,512 --> 07:33:38,009
Like I'm attempting to move,

10202
07:33:38,009 --> 07:33:38,909
and it's just picking that up

10203
07:33:38,909 --> 07:33:40,950
so it doesn't feel like it's with my mind.

10204
07:33:40,950 --> 07:33:42,780
When I moved it for the
first time like that,

10205
07:33:42,779 --> 07:33:45,242
it was, oh man.

10206
07:33:46,409 --> 07:33:50,909
It made me think that this technology,

10207
07:33:50,909 --> 07:33:54,599
that what I'm doing is actually way,

10208
07:33:54,599 --> 07:33:56,759
way more impressive than I ever thought.

10209
07:33:56,759 --> 07:33:58,409
It was way cooler than I ever thought.

10210
07:33:58,409 --> 07:34:02,310
And it just opened up a whole
new world of possibilities

10211
07:34:02,310 --> 07:34:05,970
of like what could possibly
happen with this technology

10212
07:34:05,970 --> 07:34:08,030
and what I might be able
to be capable of with it.

10213
07:34:08,029 --> 07:34:10,259
- Because you had felt for the first time,

10214
07:34:10,259 --> 07:34:12,272
like this was digital telepathy.

10215
07:34:12,273 --> 07:34:15,600
Like you're controlling a
digital device with your mind.

10216
07:34:15,599 --> 07:34:16,739
- [Noland] Yep.

10217
07:34:16,740 --> 07:34:19,110
- I mean, that's a real
moment of discovery.

10218
07:34:19,110 --> 07:34:19,942
That's really cool.

10219
07:34:19,942 --> 07:34:21,360
Like you've discovered something.

10220
07:34:21,360 --> 07:34:26,360
I've seen like scientists talk
about like a big aha moment.

10221
07:34:26,430 --> 07:34:27,569
Like Nobel Prize winning,

10222
07:34:27,569 --> 07:34:30,779
they'll have this like holy crap.

10223
07:34:30,779 --> 07:34:32,639
- Yeah.
- Like whoa.

10224
07:34:32,639 --> 07:34:33,779
- That's what it felt.

10225
07:34:33,779 --> 07:34:34,772
I didn't feel like,

10226
07:34:35,610 --> 07:34:38,430
like I felt like I had
discovered something but for me.

10227
07:34:38,430 --> 07:34:41,909
Maybe not necessarily for
like the world at large

10228
07:34:41,909 --> 07:34:43,799
or like this field at large.

10229
07:34:43,799 --> 07:34:46,680
It just felt like an aha moment for me.

10230
07:34:46,680 --> 07:34:48,389
Like, "Oh this works."

10231
07:34:48,389 --> 07:34:50,042
Like obviously, it works.

10232
07:34:51,090 --> 07:34:54,060
And so that's what I do
like all the time now.

10233
07:34:54,060 --> 07:34:57,750
I kind of intermix the attempted movement

10234
07:34:57,750 --> 07:35:00,119
and imagined movement.

10235
07:35:00,119 --> 07:35:02,309
I do it all like together,

10236
07:35:02,310 --> 07:35:06,659
because I've found that there
is some interplay with it

10237
07:35:06,659 --> 07:35:10,829
that maximizes efficiency with the cursor.

10238
07:35:10,830 --> 07:35:12,240
So it's not all like one or the other.

10239
07:35:12,240 --> 07:35:15,180
It's not all just, I only use attempted

10240
07:35:15,180 --> 07:35:17,490
or I only use like imagined movements.

10241
07:35:17,490 --> 07:35:21,240
It's more I use them in parallel,

10242
07:35:21,240 --> 07:35:23,880
and I can do one or the other.

10243
07:35:23,880 --> 07:35:27,659
I can just completely think
about whatever I'm doing.

10244
07:35:27,659 --> 07:35:30,299
But I don't know.

10245
07:35:30,299 --> 07:35:31,273
I like to play around with it.

10246
07:35:31,273 --> 07:35:33,659
I also like to just
experiment with these things.

10247
07:35:33,659 --> 07:35:34,860
Like every now and again,

10248
07:35:34,860 --> 07:35:36,729
I'll get this idea in my head like,

10249
07:35:36,729 --> 07:35:38,310
"Hmm, I wonder if this works."

10250
07:35:38,310 --> 07:35:39,450
And I'll just start doing it,

10251
07:35:39,450 --> 07:35:40,687
and then afterwards, I'll tell them,

10252
07:35:40,687 --> 07:35:43,687
"By the way, I wasn't doing
that like you guys wanted me to.

10253
07:35:44,819 --> 07:35:48,540
I thought of something and I
wanted to try it and so I did.

10254
07:35:48,540 --> 07:35:49,530
It seems like it works,

10255
07:35:49,529 --> 07:35:51,930
so maybe we should like
explore that a little bit."

10256
07:35:51,930 --> 07:35:54,209
- So I think that discovery
is not just for you,

10257
07:35:54,209 --> 07:35:56,159
at least from my perspective,
that's the discovery

10258
07:35:56,159 --> 07:35:59,970
for everyone else who
ever uses a Neuralink

10259
07:35:59,970 --> 07:36:01,470
that this is possible.

10260
07:36:01,470 --> 07:36:03,630
Like I don't think this an obvious thing

10261
07:36:03,630 --> 07:36:05,100
that this is even possible.

10262
07:36:05,099 --> 07:36:08,489
It's like, I was saying to Bliss earlier,

10263
07:36:08,490 --> 07:36:10,200
it's like the four-minute mile.

10264
07:36:10,200 --> 07:36:11,729
People thought it was
impossible to run a mile

10265
07:36:11,729 --> 07:36:14,669
in four minutes, and once
the first person did it,

10266
07:36:14,669 --> 07:36:16,799
then everyone just started doing it.

10267
07:36:16,799 --> 07:36:18,899
So like just to show that it's possible,

10268
07:36:18,900 --> 07:36:21,150
that paves the way to
like anyone can not do it.

10269
07:36:21,150 --> 07:36:22,920
That's the thing that's actually possible.

10270
07:36:22,919 --> 07:36:24,809
You don't need to do
the attempted movement.

10271
07:36:24,810 --> 07:36:26,729
You can just go direct.

10272
07:36:26,729 --> 07:36:27,630
That's crazy.

10273
07:36:27,630 --> 07:36:29,293
- It is crazy, it's crazy.

10274
07:36:30,659 --> 07:36:31,829
- For people who don't know,

10275
07:36:31,830 --> 07:36:34,200
can you explain how the Link app works?

10276
07:36:34,200 --> 07:36:36,840
You have an amazing stream on the topic.

10277
07:36:36,840 --> 07:36:41,700
Your first stream, I think,
on X describing the app.

10278
07:36:41,700 --> 07:36:43,830
Can you just describe how it works?

10279
07:36:43,830 --> 07:36:47,230
- Yeah, so it's just an
app that Neuralink created

10280
07:36:48,900 --> 07:36:51,990
to help me interact with the computer.

10281
07:36:51,990 --> 07:36:56,520
So on the Link app, there
are a few different settings

10282
07:36:56,520 --> 07:36:59,970
and different modes and
things I can do on it.

10283
07:36:59,970 --> 07:37:01,260
So there's like the body mapping,

10284
07:37:01,259 --> 07:37:03,569
which we kind of touched on.

10285
07:37:03,569 --> 07:37:05,939
There's a calibration.

10286
07:37:05,939 --> 07:37:10,469
Calibration is how I
actually get cursor control.

10287
07:37:10,470 --> 07:37:14,370
So calibrating what's going on in my brain

10288
07:37:14,369 --> 07:37:18,270
to translate that into cursor control.

10289
07:37:18,270 --> 07:37:22,830
So it will pop out models.

10290
07:37:22,830 --> 07:37:25,230
What they use I think is like time.

10291
07:37:25,229 --> 07:37:27,897
So it would be five minutes,

10292
07:37:27,897 --> 07:37:31,560
and calibration will give
me so good of a model.

10293
07:37:31,560 --> 07:37:35,069
And then if I'm in it for
10 minutes and 15 minutes,

10294
07:37:35,069 --> 07:37:37,439
the models will progressively get better.

10295
07:37:37,439 --> 07:37:41,129
And so the longer I'm in it generally,

10296
07:37:41,130 --> 07:37:43,319
the better the models will get.

10297
07:37:43,319 --> 07:37:46,139
- That's really cool, 'cause
you often refer to the models.

10298
07:37:46,139 --> 07:37:47,790
The model's the thing that's constructed

10299
07:37:47,790 --> 07:37:49,799
once you go through the calibration step.

10300
07:37:49,799 --> 07:37:51,099
And then you also talked about,

10301
07:37:51,099 --> 07:37:54,090
sometimes you'll play like
a really difficult game,

10302
07:37:54,090 --> 07:37:56,909
like Snake, just to see
how good the model is.

10303
07:37:56,909 --> 07:37:58,709
- Yeah, yeah, so Snake is kind of like

10304
07:37:58,709 --> 07:38:00,599
my litmus test for models.

10305
07:38:00,599 --> 07:38:03,299
If I can control Snake decently well,

10306
07:38:03,299 --> 07:38:05,819
then I know I have a pretty good model.

10307
07:38:05,819 --> 07:38:07,770
So yeah, the Link app has all of those.

10308
07:38:07,770 --> 07:38:09,959
It has Webgrid in it now.

10309
07:38:09,959 --> 07:38:11,669
It's also how I like connect

10310
07:38:11,669 --> 07:38:14,009
to the computer just in general.

10311
07:38:14,009 --> 07:38:17,099
So they've given me a lot
of like voice controls

10312
07:38:17,099 --> 07:38:20,639
with it at this point,
so I can say like connect

10313
07:38:20,639 --> 07:38:22,559
or implant disconnect.

10314
07:38:22,560 --> 07:38:27,150
And as long as I have that charger handy,

10315
07:38:27,150 --> 07:38:28,050
then I can connect to it.

10316
07:38:28,049 --> 07:38:30,569
So the charger is also how
I connect to the Link app,

10317
07:38:30,569 --> 07:38:31,739
to connect to the computer.

10318
07:38:31,740 --> 07:38:36,270
I have to have the implant
charger over my head

10319
07:38:36,270 --> 07:38:38,549
when I wanna connect to have it wake up,

10320
07:38:38,549 --> 07:38:41,279
'cause the implant's in hibernation mode,

10321
07:38:41,279 --> 07:38:42,979
like always when I'm not using it.

10322
07:38:44,069 --> 07:38:48,959
I think there's a setting to
like wake it up every so long.

10323
07:38:48,959 --> 07:38:51,569
So we could set it to
half an hour or five hours

10324
07:38:51,569 --> 07:38:54,722
or something if I just want
it to wake up periodically.

10325
07:38:56,040 --> 07:38:58,650
So yeah, I'll like
connect to the Link app,

10326
07:38:58,650 --> 07:39:01,800
and then go through all sorts of things.

10327
07:39:01,799 --> 07:39:04,794
Calibration for the
day, maybe body mapping.

10328
07:39:04,794 --> 07:39:07,679
I made them give me like
a little homework tab,

10329
07:39:07,680 --> 07:39:10,680
because I am very forgetful

10330
07:39:10,680 --> 07:39:13,113
and I forget to do things a lot.

10331
07:39:14,069 --> 07:39:16,709
So I have like a lot of
data collection things

10332
07:39:16,709 --> 07:39:18,079
that they want me to do.

10333
07:39:18,080 --> 07:39:20,190
- Is the body mapping part
of the data collection,

10334
07:39:20,189 --> 07:39:21,022
or is that also part of the-

10335
07:39:21,023 --> 07:39:22,020
- Yeah, it is.

10336
07:39:22,020 --> 07:39:25,470
It's something that they
want me to do daily,

10337
07:39:25,470 --> 07:39:26,477
which I've been slacking on,

10338
07:39:26,476 --> 07:39:28,289
'cause I've been doing so much media

10339
07:39:28,290 --> 07:39:29,569
and traveling so much.

10340
07:39:29,569 --> 07:39:31,380
So I've been-
- You've been super famous.

10341
07:39:31,380 --> 07:39:34,889
- Yeah, I've been a
terrible first candidate

10342
07:39:34,889 --> 07:39:38,402
for how much I've been
slacking on my homework.

10343
07:39:39,389 --> 07:39:41,040
But yeah, it's just
something that they want me

10344
07:39:41,040 --> 07:39:44,250
to do every day to track

10345
07:39:44,250 --> 07:39:48,150
how well the Neuralink
is performing over time

10346
07:39:48,150 --> 07:39:49,530
and to have something to give.

10347
07:39:49,529 --> 07:39:52,169
I imagine to give to the FDA to create

10348
07:39:52,169 --> 07:39:55,356
all sorts of fancy charts
and stuff and show like,

10349
07:39:55,356 --> 07:39:57,230
"Hey, this is what the Neuralink,

10350
07:39:57,230 --> 07:40:00,509
this is how it's performing
day one versus day 90

10351
07:40:00,509 --> 07:40:02,669
versus day 180 and things like that.

10352
07:40:02,669 --> 07:40:03,899
- What's the calibration step like?

10353
07:40:03,900 --> 07:40:06,930
Is it like move left, move right?

10354
07:40:06,930 --> 07:40:09,029
- It's a bubble game.

10355
07:40:09,029 --> 07:40:10,590
So there will be like yellow bubbles

10356
07:40:10,590 --> 07:40:12,090
that pop up on the screen.

10357
07:40:12,090 --> 07:40:14,759
At first, it is open loop.

10358
07:40:14,759 --> 07:40:16,559
So open loop, this is something

10359
07:40:16,560 --> 07:40:19,260
that I still don't fully understand,

10360
07:40:19,259 --> 07:40:21,539
the open loop and closed loop thing.

10361
07:40:21,540 --> 07:40:22,740
- And me and Bliss talked for a long time

10362
07:40:22,740 --> 07:40:25,290
about the difference between
the two on the technical side.

10363
07:40:25,290 --> 07:40:26,580
- Okay.
- So it'd be great to hear

10364
07:40:26,580 --> 07:40:29,070
your side of the story.

10365
07:40:29,069 --> 07:40:31,680
- Open loop is basically,

10366
07:40:31,680 --> 07:40:34,170
I have no control over the cursor.

10367
07:40:34,169 --> 07:40:37,500
The cursor will be moving on
its own across the screen,

10368
07:40:37,500 --> 07:40:40,919
and I am following by intention

10369
07:40:40,919 --> 07:40:43,379
the cursor to different bubbles.

10370
07:40:43,380 --> 07:40:47,340
And then the algorithm is training off

10371
07:40:47,340 --> 07:40:51,000
of what like the signals it's
getting are as I'm doing this.

10372
07:40:51,000 --> 07:40:52,560
There are a couple different
ways that they've done it.

10373
07:40:52,560 --> 07:40:54,840
They call it center out target.

10374
07:40:54,840 --> 07:40:56,880
So there will be a bubble in the middle

10375
07:40:56,880 --> 07:40:58,707
and then eight bubbles around that.

10376
07:40:58,706 --> 07:41:02,579
And the cursor will go from
the middle to one side.

10377
07:41:02,580 --> 07:41:04,950
So say middle to left, back to middle,

10378
07:41:04,950 --> 07:41:07,500
to up, to middle, like up, right.

10379
07:41:07,500 --> 07:41:10,229
And they'll do that all
the way around the circle.

10380
07:41:10,229 --> 07:41:13,709
And I will follow that
cursor the whole time,

10381
07:41:13,709 --> 07:41:17,099
and then it will train
off of my intentions,

10382
07:41:17,099 --> 07:41:20,879
what it is expecting my intentions to be

10383
07:41:20,880 --> 07:41:22,440
throughout the whole process.

10384
07:41:22,439 --> 07:41:24,180
- Can you actually speak to,

10385
07:41:24,180 --> 07:41:25,860
when you say follow-
- Yes.

10386
07:41:25,860 --> 07:41:27,090
- You don't mean with your eyes.

10387
07:41:27,090 --> 07:41:28,409
You mean with your intentions.

10388
07:41:28,409 --> 07:41:30,840
- Yeah, so generally for calibration,

10389
07:41:30,840 --> 07:41:32,670
I'm doing attempted movements,

10390
07:41:32,669 --> 07:41:34,289
'cause I think it works better.

10391
07:41:34,290 --> 07:41:37,380
I think the better models,

10392
07:41:37,380 --> 07:41:40,052
as I progress through calibration,

10393
07:41:40,919 --> 07:41:45,569
make it easier to use imagined movements.

10394
07:41:45,569 --> 07:41:46,402
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10395
07:41:46,402 --> 07:41:49,500
So calibrated on attempted movement

10396
07:41:49,500 --> 07:41:53,250
will create a model that
makes it really effective

10397
07:41:53,250 --> 07:41:55,860
for you to then use the force?

10398
07:41:55,860 --> 07:42:00,389
- Yes, I've tried doing calibration

10399
07:42:00,389 --> 07:42:02,549
with imagined movement,

10400
07:42:02,549 --> 07:42:05,880
and it just doesn't work
as well for some reason.

10401
07:42:05,880 --> 07:42:07,680
So that was the center out targets.

10402
07:42:07,680 --> 07:42:10,110
There's also one where a random target

10403
07:42:10,110 --> 07:42:12,209
will pop up on the
screen and it's the same.

10404
07:42:12,209 --> 07:42:14,049
I just like move, I follow along

10405
07:42:15,150 --> 07:42:16,920
with wherever the cursor
is to that target,

10406
07:42:16,919 --> 07:42:18,750
all across the screen.

10407
07:42:18,750 --> 07:42:22,409
I've tried those with imagined movement,

10408
07:42:22,409 --> 07:42:25,622
and for some reason,
the models just don't,

10409
07:42:28,259 --> 07:42:31,859
they don't give as high level as quality

10410
07:42:31,860 --> 07:42:34,113
when we get into closed loop.

10411
07:42:35,279 --> 07:42:37,169
I haven't played around with it a ton,

10412
07:42:37,169 --> 07:42:38,549
so maybe like the different ways

10413
07:42:38,549 --> 07:42:41,909
that we're doing calibration
now might make it a bit better.

10414
07:42:41,909 --> 07:42:46,909
But what I've found is there
will be a point in calibration

10415
07:42:46,950 --> 07:42:50,400
where I can use imagined movement.

10416
07:42:50,400 --> 07:42:53,520
Before that point, it doesn't really work.

10417
07:42:53,520 --> 07:42:58,260
So if I do calibration for 45 minutes,

10418
07:42:58,259 --> 07:43:03,059
the first 15 minutes, I
can't use imagined movement.

10419
07:43:03,060 --> 07:43:05,159
It just like doesn't work for some reason.

10420
07:43:06,330 --> 07:43:08,523
And after a certain point,

10421
07:43:09,810 --> 07:43:11,310
I can just sort of feel it.

10422
07:43:11,310 --> 07:43:14,430
I can tell it moves different.

10423
07:43:14,430 --> 07:43:16,500
That's the best way I can describe it.

10424
07:43:16,500 --> 07:43:20,069
Like it's almost as if it is anticipating

10425
07:43:20,069 --> 07:43:23,913
what I am going to do
again before I go to do it.

10426
07:43:25,116 --> 07:43:29,489
And so using attempted
movement for 15 minutes,

10427
07:43:29,490 --> 07:43:31,860
at some point, I can kind of tell

10428
07:43:31,860 --> 07:43:34,799
when I like move my
eyes to the next target

10429
07:43:34,799 --> 07:43:37,229
that the cursor is
starting to like pick up.

10430
07:43:37,229 --> 07:43:38,970
Like it's starting to understand,

10431
07:43:38,970 --> 07:43:41,010
it's learning like what I'm going to do.

10432
07:43:41,009 --> 07:43:42,659
- So first of all, it's really cool that,

10433
07:43:42,659 --> 07:43:45,029
I mean, you are a true
pioneer in all of this.

10434
07:43:45,029 --> 07:43:47,759
You're like exploring how to do

10435
07:43:47,759 --> 07:43:51,719
every aspect of this most
effectively, and there's just,

10436
07:43:51,720 --> 07:43:53,580
I imagine so many lessons
learned from this.

10437
07:43:53,580 --> 07:43:55,500
So thank you for being a pioneer

10438
07:43:55,500 --> 07:43:58,049
in all these kinds of different
like super technical ways.

10439
07:43:58,049 --> 07:44:01,529
And it's also cool to hear
that there's like a different

10440
07:44:01,529 --> 07:44:04,919
like feeling to the experience

10441
07:44:04,919 --> 07:44:06,932
when it's calibrated in different ways,

10442
07:44:08,400 --> 07:44:10,380
'cause I mean, I imagine your brain

10443
07:44:10,380 --> 07:44:12,490
is doing something different,

10444
07:44:12,490 --> 07:44:14,250
and that's why there's a
different feeling to it.

10445
07:44:14,250 --> 07:44:18,119
And then trying to find the
words and the measurements

10446
07:44:18,119 --> 07:44:19,799
to those feelings would
be also interesting.

10447
07:44:19,799 --> 07:44:21,689
But at the end of the
day, you can also measure

10448
07:44:21,689 --> 07:44:23,639
that your actual performance

10449
07:44:23,639 --> 07:44:25,290
on whether it's Snake or Webgrid,

10450
07:44:26,184 --> 07:44:27,870
you could see like what
actually works well.

10451
07:44:27,869 --> 07:44:31,919
And you're saying, for
the open loop calibration,

10452
07:44:31,919 --> 07:44:34,979
the attempted movement works best for now.

10453
07:44:34,979 --> 07:44:36,596
- Yep, yep.

10454
07:44:36,597 --> 07:44:40,260
- So the open loop, you
don't get the feedback

10455
07:44:40,259 --> 07:44:41,609
that you did something.

10456
07:44:41,610 --> 07:44:43,409
- Yeah-
- Is that frustrating?

10457
07:44:43,409 --> 07:44:45,389
- No, no, it makes sense to me.

10458
07:44:45,389 --> 07:44:47,489
Like we've done it with a cursor

10459
07:44:47,490 --> 07:44:49,080
and without a cursor in open loop.

10460
07:44:49,080 --> 07:44:53,523
So sometimes, it's just,
say, for like the center out,

10461
07:44:55,560 --> 07:44:59,819
you'll start calibration
with a bubble lighting up,

10462
07:44:59,819 --> 07:45:01,739
and I push towards that bubble.

10463
07:45:01,740 --> 07:45:03,780
And then when that bubble,

10464
07:45:03,779 --> 07:45:06,329
when it's pushed towards
that bubble for say,

10465
07:45:06,330 --> 07:45:08,100
three seconds a bubble will pop

10466
07:45:08,099 --> 07:45:09,899
and then I come back to the middle.

10467
07:45:09,900 --> 07:45:13,140
So I'm doing it all just by my intentions.

10468
07:45:13,139 --> 07:45:14,849
Like that's what it's learning anyways.

10469
07:45:14,849 --> 07:45:17,250
So it makes sense that as long as I follow

10470
07:45:17,250 --> 07:45:19,919
what they want me to do, like
follow the yellow brick road,

10471
07:45:19,919 --> 07:45:21,119
that it'll all work out.

10472
07:45:22,380 --> 07:45:24,630
- You're full of great references.

10473
07:45:24,630 --> 07:45:26,520
Is the bubble game fun?

10474
07:45:26,520 --> 07:45:29,850
- Yeah, they always feel so
bad making me do calibration.

10475
07:45:29,849 --> 07:45:33,389
Like, "Oh, we're about to
do a 40-minute calibration."

10476
07:45:33,389 --> 07:45:36,239
I'm like, "All right, do you
guys wanna do two of them?"

10477
07:45:36,240 --> 07:45:38,280
Like I'm always asking to,

10478
07:45:38,279 --> 07:45:40,979
like whatever they need,
I'm more than happy to do.

10479
07:45:40,979 --> 07:45:43,229
And it's not bad.

10480
07:45:43,229 --> 07:45:46,649
Like I get to lie there or sit in my chair

10481
07:45:46,650 --> 07:45:50,730
and like do these things
with some great people.

10482
07:45:50,729 --> 07:45:52,590
I get to have great conversations.

10483
07:45:52,590 --> 07:45:55,049
I can give them feedback.

10484
07:45:55,049 --> 07:45:57,479
I can talk about all sorts of things.

10485
07:45:57,479 --> 07:46:00,209
I could throw something on
on my TV in the background

10486
07:46:00,209 --> 07:46:02,792
and kinda like split my
attention between them.

10487
07:46:03,930 --> 07:46:05,310
Like it's not bad at all.

10488
07:46:05,310 --> 07:46:06,210
I don't mind it.
- Is there a score

10489
07:46:06,209 --> 07:46:07,328
that you get?

10490
07:46:07,329 --> 07:46:08,790
Like can you do better on the bubble game?

10491
07:46:08,790 --> 07:46:10,113
- No, I would love that.

10492
07:46:11,554 --> 07:46:13,560
I would love-
- Yeah.

10493
07:46:13,560 --> 07:46:17,850
Writing down suggestions from Noland.

10494
07:46:17,849 --> 07:46:19,745
- That's-
- Make it more fun.

10495
07:46:19,745 --> 07:46:20,639
Gamified.

10496
07:46:20,639 --> 07:46:21,659
- Yeah, that's one thing

10497
07:46:21,659 --> 07:46:24,234
that I really, really enjoy about Webgrid

10498
07:46:24,234 --> 07:46:26,582
is 'cause I'm so competitive.

10499
07:46:27,869 --> 07:46:31,739
Like the higher the BPS,
the higher the score,

10500
07:46:31,740 --> 07:46:33,273
I know the better I'm doing.

10501
07:46:34,319 --> 07:46:37,169
I think I've asked at one
point one of the guys,

10502
07:46:37,169 --> 07:46:40,049
like if he could give me some
sort of numerical feedback

10503
07:46:40,049 --> 07:46:41,939
for calibration, like I would like to know

10504
07:46:41,939 --> 07:46:42,809
what they're looking at.

10505
07:46:42,810 --> 07:46:47,670
Like, "Oh, we see like this number

10506
07:46:47,669 --> 07:46:48,750
while you're doing calibration,

10507
07:46:48,750 --> 07:46:50,430
and that means, at least on our end,

10508
07:46:50,430 --> 07:46:52,479
that we think calibration is going well."

10509
07:46:53,580 --> 07:46:56,280
And I would love that,
because I would like to know

10510
07:46:56,279 --> 07:46:58,199
if what I'm doing is going well or not.

10511
07:46:58,200 --> 07:46:59,297
But then they've also told me like,

10512
07:46:59,296 --> 07:47:01,619
"Yeah, not necessarily like one-to-one."

10513
07:47:01,619 --> 07:47:02,969
It doesn't actually mean

10514
07:47:02,970 --> 07:47:06,180
that calibration is
going well in some ways.

10515
07:47:06,180 --> 07:47:07,650
So it's not like 100%,

10516
07:47:07,650 --> 07:47:11,190
and they don't wanna like
skew what I'm experiencing

10517
07:47:11,189 --> 07:47:13,079
or want me to change things based on that.

10518
07:47:13,080 --> 07:47:14,700
If that number isn't always accurate

10519
07:47:14,700 --> 07:47:16,350
to like how the model will turn out

10520
07:47:16,349 --> 07:47:17,909
or how like the end result,

10521
07:47:17,909 --> 07:47:19,919
that's at least what I got from it.

10522
07:47:19,919 --> 07:47:22,166
One thing I do that I have asked them

10523
07:47:22,167 --> 07:47:26,010
and something that I
really enjoy striving for

10524
07:47:26,009 --> 07:47:27,959
is towards the end of calibration,

10525
07:47:27,959 --> 07:47:31,409
there is like a time between targets.

10526
07:47:31,409 --> 07:47:33,119
And so I like to keep,

10527
07:47:33,119 --> 07:47:35,819
like at the end, that
number as low as possible.

10528
07:47:35,819 --> 07:47:37,889
So at the beginning,
it can be four or five,

10529
07:47:37,889 --> 07:47:40,439
six seconds between me popping bubbles.

10530
07:47:40,439 --> 07:47:43,799
But towards the end, I like
to keep it below like 1.5.

10531
07:47:43,799 --> 07:47:46,229
Or if I could, get it to like one second

10532
07:47:46,229 --> 07:47:48,959
between like bubbles, because in my mind,

10533
07:47:48,959 --> 07:47:52,169
that translates really nicely
to something like Webgrid

10534
07:47:52,169 --> 07:47:56,639
where I know if I can hit
a target one every second

10535
07:47:56,639 --> 07:47:58,590
that I'm doing real, real well.

10536
07:47:58,590 --> 07:47:59,422
- There you go, that's a way

10537
07:47:59,422 --> 07:48:00,869
to get a score on the calibrations.

10538
07:48:00,869 --> 07:48:02,909
Like the speed, how quickly can you get

10539
07:48:02,909 --> 07:48:04,459
from bubble to bubble.
- Yeah.

10540
07:48:05,400 --> 07:48:06,840
- So there's the open loop,

10541
07:48:06,840 --> 07:48:08,170
and then it goes to the closed loop.

10542
07:48:08,169 --> 07:48:09,659
- Closed loop.
- The closed loop

10543
07:48:09,659 --> 07:48:11,147
can already start giving you a sense,

10544
07:48:11,147 --> 07:48:12,569
'cause you're getting feedback

10545
07:48:12,569 --> 07:48:13,770
of like how good the model is.

10546
07:48:13,770 --> 07:48:18,689
- Yeah, so closed loop is when
I first get cursor control

10547
07:48:18,689 --> 07:48:21,239
and how they've described it to me,

10548
07:48:21,240 --> 07:48:23,670
someone who does not
understand this stuff,

10549
07:48:23,669 --> 07:48:25,409
I am the dumbest person in the room

10550
07:48:25,409 --> 07:48:27,540
every time I'm with-
- I love the humility.

10551
07:48:27,540 --> 07:48:30,780
- Yeah, is that I am closing the loop.

10552
07:48:30,779 --> 07:48:35,279
So I am actually now the
one that is like finishing

10553
07:48:35,279 --> 07:48:37,949
the loop of whatever this loop is.

10554
07:48:37,950 --> 07:48:40,110
I don't even know what the
loop is, they've never told me.

10555
07:48:40,110 --> 07:48:41,459
They just say there is a loop.

10556
07:48:41,459 --> 07:48:44,369
And at one point, it's
open and I can't control.

10557
07:48:44,369 --> 07:48:46,919
And then I get control and it's closed.

10558
07:48:46,919 --> 07:48:48,750
So I'm finishing the loop.

10559
07:48:48,750 --> 07:48:50,849
- So how long the
calibration usually take?

10560
07:48:50,849 --> 07:48:52,319
You said like 10, 15 minutes.

10561
07:48:52,319 --> 07:48:53,849
- Well, yeah, they're trying to get

10562
07:48:53,849 --> 07:48:55,709
that number down pretty low.

10563
07:48:55,709 --> 07:48:57,659
That's what we've been
working on a lot recently

10564
07:48:57,659 --> 07:49:01,290
is getting that down as low
as possible, so that way,

10565
07:49:01,290 --> 07:49:04,680
if this is something that people
need to do on a daily basis

10566
07:49:04,680 --> 07:49:06,060
or if some people need to do

10567
07:49:06,060 --> 07:49:11,060
on a like every other
day basis or once a week,

10568
07:49:11,220 --> 07:49:13,290
they don't want people to
be sitting in calibration

10569
07:49:13,290 --> 07:49:15,000
for long periods of time.

10570
07:49:15,000 --> 07:49:17,009
I think they've wanted to get it down

10571
07:49:17,009 --> 07:49:20,250
seven minutes or below, at
least where we're at right now.

10572
07:49:20,250 --> 07:49:23,790
It'd be nice if you never
had to do calibration.

10573
07:49:23,790 --> 07:49:26,310
So we'll get there at
some point, I'm sure,

10574
07:49:26,310 --> 07:49:27,720
the more we learn about the brain

10575
07:49:27,720 --> 07:49:31,023
and like I think that's the dream.

10576
07:49:32,310 --> 07:49:33,690
I think right now,

10577
07:49:33,689 --> 07:49:36,809
for me to get like really,
really good models,

10578
07:49:36,810 --> 07:49:39,393
I am in calibration 40 or 45 minutes.

10579
07:49:40,590 --> 07:49:42,029
And I don't mind.

10580
07:49:42,029 --> 07:49:43,680
Like I said, they always feel really bad,

10581
07:49:43,680 --> 07:49:45,569
but if it's gonna get me a model

10582
07:49:45,569 --> 07:49:47,939
that can like break
these records on Webgrid,

10583
07:49:47,939 --> 07:49:50,369
I'll stay in it for flipping two hours.

10584
07:49:50,369 --> 07:49:51,360
- Let's talk business.

10585
07:49:51,360 --> 07:49:52,192
So Webgrid.

10586
07:49:53,729 --> 07:49:56,669
I saw a presentation
where Bliss said by March,

10587
07:49:56,669 --> 07:49:59,969
you selected 89,000 targets in Webgrid.

10588
07:49:59,970 --> 07:50:01,590
Can you explain this game?

10589
07:50:01,590 --> 07:50:04,590
What is Webgrid, and what does it take

10590
07:50:04,590 --> 07:50:07,560
to be a world class performer in Webgrid,

10591
07:50:07,560 --> 07:50:09,600
as you continue to break world records?

10592
07:50:09,599 --> 07:50:10,432
- Yeah.

10593
07:50:13,962 --> 07:50:15,479
- It's like a gold medalist, like well.

10594
07:50:15,479 --> 07:50:17,406
- Yeah, I'd like to thank,

10595
07:50:17,406 --> 07:50:19,529
I'd like to thank everyone
who's helped me get here,

10596
07:50:19,529 --> 07:50:23,039
my coaches, my parents for
driving me to practice every day

10597
07:50:23,040 --> 07:50:24,630
at five in the morning.

10598
07:50:24,630 --> 07:50:25,593
Like to thank God.

10599
07:50:26,700 --> 07:50:29,940
And just overall, my
dedication to my craft.

10600
07:50:29,939 --> 07:50:31,049
- The interviews with athletes,

10601
07:50:31,049 --> 07:50:31,930
they're always like that,

10602
07:50:31,930 --> 07:50:34,229
it's like that template.

10603
07:50:34,229 --> 07:50:35,062
- Yeah.

10604
07:50:37,923 --> 07:50:38,851
- So Webgrid

10605
07:50:38,851 --> 07:50:41,925
is a grid that sells.
- Webgrid is, yeah.

10606
07:50:41,925 --> 07:50:44,159
It's literally just a grid.

10607
07:50:44,159 --> 07:50:48,240
They can make it as big or
small as you can make a grid.

10608
07:50:48,240 --> 07:50:50,083
A single box on that grid will light up

10609
07:50:50,082 --> 07:50:51,659
and you go and click it.

10610
07:50:51,659 --> 07:50:56,659
And it is a way for them to
benchmark how good a BCI is.

10611
07:50:57,029 --> 07:51:00,090
So it's pretty straightforward.

10612
07:51:00,090 --> 07:51:01,619
You just click targets.

10613
07:51:01,619 --> 07:51:03,869
- [Lex] Only one blue cell appears,

10614
07:51:03,869 --> 07:51:05,219
and you're supposed to move the mouse

10615
07:51:05,220 --> 07:51:06,630
to there and click on it.
- Yep.

10616
07:51:06,630 --> 07:51:09,450
So I like playing on like bigger grids,

10617
07:51:09,450 --> 07:51:14,450
'cause the bigger the
grid, the like more BPS.

10618
07:51:14,880 --> 07:51:18,990
It's bits per second that you
get every time you click one.

10619
07:51:18,990 --> 07:51:23,340
So I'll say, I'll play
on like a 35 by 35 grid,

10620
07:51:23,340 --> 07:51:26,610
and then one of those little squares cell,

10621
07:51:26,610 --> 07:51:28,170
we call it target, whatever,

10622
07:51:28,169 --> 07:51:29,909
will light up and you
move the cursor there

10623
07:51:29,909 --> 07:51:34,799
and you click it and
then you do that forever.

10624
07:51:34,799 --> 07:51:36,360
- And you've been able to achieve

10625
07:51:36,360 --> 07:51:38,127
at first eight bits per second.

10626
07:51:38,127 --> 07:51:40,260
And then you recently broke that.

10627
07:51:40,259 --> 07:51:42,359
- Yeah, I'm at 8.5 right now.

10628
07:51:42,360 --> 07:51:44,430
I would've beaten that literally

10629
07:51:44,430 --> 07:51:47,849
the day before I came to Austin.

10630
07:51:47,849 --> 07:51:50,539
But I had like, I don't know,

10631
07:51:50,540 --> 07:51:53,130
like a five second lag right at the end.

10632
07:51:53,130 --> 07:51:56,970
And I just had to wait until
the latency calmed down

10633
07:51:56,970 --> 07:51:58,319
and then I kept clicking.

10634
07:51:58,319 --> 07:52:03,319
But I was at like 8.01 and
then five seconds of lag,

10635
07:52:03,659 --> 07:52:05,430
and then the next like
three targets I clicked

10636
07:52:05,430 --> 07:52:07,650
all stayed at 8.01.

10637
07:52:07,650 --> 07:52:11,490
So if I would've been able to
click during that time of lag,

10638
07:52:11,490 --> 07:52:14,220
I probably would've hit, I
don't know, I might've hit nine.

10639
07:52:14,220 --> 07:52:15,307
So I'm there.

10640
07:52:15,307 --> 07:52:16,650
I'm really close.

10641
07:52:16,650 --> 07:52:18,600
And then this whole Austin trip

10642
07:52:18,599 --> 07:52:20,819
has really gotten in the way of my Webgrid

10643
07:52:20,819 --> 07:52:22,331
playing ability.
- It's frustrating.

10644
07:52:22,331 --> 07:52:23,340
- Yeah, it's-
- So that's all you've been

10645
07:52:23,340 --> 07:52:24,209
thinking about right now?

10646
07:52:24,209 --> 07:52:25,042
- Yeah, I know.

10647
07:52:25,931 --> 07:52:28,590
I want to do better at nine.

10648
07:52:28,590 --> 07:52:29,520
I want to do better.

10649
07:52:29,520 --> 07:52:31,049
I wanna hit nine, I think.

10650
07:52:31,049 --> 07:52:33,329
Well, I know nine is
very, very achievable.

10651
07:52:33,330 --> 07:52:34,353
I'm right there.

10652
07:52:35,400 --> 07:52:39,090
I think 10 I could hit
maybe in the next month.

10653
07:52:39,090 --> 07:52:40,049
Like I could do it probably

10654
07:52:40,049 --> 07:52:41,849
in the next few weeks if I really push it.

10655
07:52:41,849 --> 07:52:44,039
- I think you and Elon are
basically the same person,

10656
07:52:44,040 --> 07:52:46,049
'cause last time I did a podcast with him,

10657
07:52:46,049 --> 07:52:47,849
he came in extremely frustrated

10658
07:52:47,849 --> 07:52:50,879
that he can't beat Uber Lilith as a droid.

10659
07:52:50,880 --> 07:52:55,290
That was like a year ago I
think, I forget, like solo.

10660
07:52:55,290 --> 07:52:58,106
And I could just tell, there's
some percentage of his brain

10661
07:52:58,106 --> 07:52:59,827
the entire time was thinking like,

10662
07:52:59,827 --> 07:53:02,370
"I wish I was right now attempting."

10663
07:53:02,369 --> 07:53:03,753
- I think he did it.

10664
07:53:03,753 --> 07:53:04,739
- He did it that night.
- Yeah.

10665
07:53:04,739 --> 07:53:07,207
- He stayed up and did it that night.

10666
07:53:07,206 --> 07:53:09,239
It's just crazy to me.

10667
07:53:09,240 --> 07:53:12,659
I mean, in a fundamental
way, it's really inspiring.

10668
07:53:12,659 --> 07:53:14,400
And what you're doing is
inspiring in that way,

10669
07:53:14,400 --> 07:53:17,069
'cause I mean, it's not
just about the game.

10670
07:53:17,069 --> 07:53:20,159
Everything you're doing there has impact.

10671
07:53:20,159 --> 07:53:23,009
By striving to do well on Webgrid,

10672
07:53:23,009 --> 07:53:25,139
you're helping everybody figure out

10673
07:53:25,139 --> 07:53:26,909
how to create the system all along,

10674
07:53:26,909 --> 07:53:30,419
like the decoding, the
software, the hardware,

10675
07:53:30,419 --> 07:53:32,039
the calibration, all of it,

10676
07:53:32,040 --> 07:53:33,479
how to make all of that work

10677
07:53:33,479 --> 07:53:36,389
so you can do everything else really well.

10678
07:53:36,389 --> 07:53:38,012
- Yeah, it's just really fun.

10679
07:53:38,849 --> 07:53:40,469
- Well, that's also,
that's part of the thing

10680
07:53:40,470 --> 07:53:42,360
is like making it fun.

10681
07:53:42,360 --> 07:53:44,490
- Yeah, it's addicting.

10682
07:53:44,490 --> 07:53:48,540
I've joked about like
what they actually did

10683
07:53:48,540 --> 07:53:50,549
when they went in and put
this thing in my brain.

10684
07:53:50,549 --> 07:53:52,110
They must have flipped a switch

10685
07:53:52,110 --> 07:53:55,590
to make me more susceptible
to these kinds of games,

10686
07:53:55,590 --> 07:53:59,040
to make me addicted to
like Webgrid or something.

10687
07:53:59,040 --> 07:54:00,360
Do you know Bliss's high score?

10688
07:54:00,360 --> 07:54:02,159
- Yeah, he said like 14 or something.

10689
07:54:02,159 --> 07:54:03,559
- 17.
- Oh boy.

10690
07:54:03,559 --> 07:54:05,580
- 17.1 or something, 17.01.

10691
07:54:05,580 --> 07:54:07,800
- 17 dot, 17.01.
- Yeah.

10692
07:54:07,799 --> 07:54:09,930
- He told me he like does it on the floor

10693
07:54:09,930 --> 07:54:11,880
with peanut butter and he like fasts.

10694
07:54:11,880 --> 07:54:13,440
It's weird.

10695
07:54:13,439 --> 07:54:14,729
That sounds like cheating.

10696
07:54:14,729 --> 07:54:17,099
Sounds like performance enhancing.

10697
07:54:17,099 --> 07:54:19,319
- [Bliss] No, like the first
time Noland played this game,

10698
07:54:19,319 --> 07:54:21,270
he asked, "How good are we at this game?"

10699
07:54:21,270 --> 07:54:23,136
And I think you told me right then,

10700
07:54:23,136 --> 07:54:24,149
"You're gonna try to beat me on that."

10701
07:54:24,150 --> 07:54:25,674
- I'm gonna get there someday.
- Yeah.

10702
07:54:25,673 --> 07:54:27,363
I fully believe you.
- I think I can.

10703
07:54:27,364 --> 07:54:28,440
- I'm excited for that.
- Yeah.

10704
07:54:28,439 --> 07:54:32,789
So I've been playing, first
off, with the dwell cursor,

10705
07:54:32,790 --> 07:54:36,690
which really hampers my
Webgrid playing ability.

10706
07:54:36,689 --> 07:54:40,169
Basically, I have to wait
0.3 seconds for every click.

10707
07:54:40,169 --> 07:54:41,949
- Oh, so you can't do the clicks.

10708
07:54:41,950 --> 07:54:45,507
So you click by dwelling, you said 0.3?

10709
07:54:45,507 --> 07:54:49,590
- 0.3 seconds, which sucks.

10710
07:54:49,590 --> 07:54:53,549
It really slows down how much I'm able to,

10711
07:54:53,549 --> 07:54:55,139
like how high I'm able to get.

10712
07:54:55,139 --> 07:54:58,979
I still hit like 50, I think I hit like 50

10713
07:54:58,979 --> 07:55:02,159
something trials, net
trials per minute in that,

10714
07:55:02,159 --> 07:55:04,683
which was pretty good,
'cause I'm able to like,

10715
07:55:06,060 --> 07:55:08,310
there's one of the settings is also

10716
07:55:08,310 --> 07:55:10,620
like how slow you need to be moving

10717
07:55:10,619 --> 07:55:13,169
in order to initiate a
click, to start a click.

10718
07:55:13,169 --> 07:55:17,462
So I can tell sort of
when I'm on that threshold

10719
07:55:18,509 --> 07:55:21,959
to start initiating a
click just a bit early,

10720
07:55:21,959 --> 07:55:25,559
so I'm not fully stopped over
the target when I go to click.

10721
07:55:25,560 --> 07:55:28,500
I'm doing it like on my
way to the targets a little

10722
07:55:28,500 --> 07:55:30,389
to try to time it just right.
- Oh wow.

10723
07:55:30,389 --> 07:55:31,829
So you're slowing down.

10724
07:55:31,830 --> 07:55:33,824
- Yeah, just a hair
right before the targets.

10725
07:55:33,824 --> 07:55:34,656
(Lex laughing)

10726
07:55:34,656 --> 07:55:37,169
- This is like elite performance, okay.

10727
07:55:37,169 --> 07:55:39,081
But that's still,

10728
07:55:39,081 --> 07:55:41,922
it sucks that there's
a ceiling of the 0.3.

10729
07:55:41,922 --> 07:55:44,332
- Well, I can get down to 0.2 and 0.1.

10730
07:55:44,332 --> 07:55:45,246
Point one's what-
- I get it.

10731
07:55:45,246 --> 07:55:47,790
- Yeah, and I've played
with that a little bit too.

10732
07:55:47,790 --> 07:55:50,790
I have to adjust a ton
of different parameters

10733
07:55:50,790 --> 07:55:51,777
in order to play with 0.1,

10734
07:55:51,776 --> 07:55:55,319
and I don't have control
over all that on my end yet.

10735
07:55:55,319 --> 07:55:58,380
It also changes like how
the models are trained.

10736
07:55:58,380 --> 07:56:00,122
Like if I train a model like in Webgrid,

10737
07:56:00,122 --> 07:56:03,270
like I bootstrap on a model,
which basically is them

10738
07:56:03,270 --> 07:56:05,170
training models as I'm playing Webgrid

10739
07:56:06,299 --> 07:56:08,669
based off of like the Webgrid data,

10740
07:56:08,669 --> 07:56:10,619
so like if I play Webgrid for 10 minutes,

10741
07:56:10,619 --> 07:56:13,950
they can train off that data specifically

10742
07:56:13,950 --> 07:56:15,930
in order to get me a better model.

10743
07:56:15,930 --> 07:56:19,049
If I do that with 0.3 versus 0.1,

10744
07:56:19,049 --> 07:56:21,029
the models come out different.

10745
07:56:21,029 --> 07:56:25,079
The way that they interact
is just much, much different.

10746
07:56:25,080 --> 07:56:26,490
So I have to be really careful.

10747
07:56:26,490 --> 07:56:28,440
I found that doing it with 0.3

10748
07:56:28,439 --> 07:56:30,059
is actually better in some ways,

10749
07:56:30,060 --> 07:56:31,890
unless I can do it with 0.1

10750
07:56:31,889 --> 07:56:33,930
and change all of the
different parameters,

10751
07:56:33,930 --> 07:56:35,400
then that's more ideal,

10752
07:56:35,400 --> 07:56:37,530
'cause obviously, 0.3 is faster than 0.1.

10753
07:56:37,529 --> 07:56:41,909
So I could get there.

10754
07:56:41,909 --> 07:56:43,020
I can get there.

10755
07:56:43,020 --> 07:56:45,426
- Can you click using your brain?

10756
07:56:45,426 --> 07:56:47,759
- For right now, it's the hover clicking

10757
07:56:47,759 --> 07:56:48,859
with the dwell cursor.

10758
07:56:49,979 --> 07:56:52,169
Before all the thread
retraction stuff happened,

10759
07:56:52,169 --> 07:56:54,959
we were calibrating clicks
- left click, right click.

10760
07:56:54,959 --> 07:56:58,200
That was my previous ceiling.

10761
07:56:58,200 --> 07:57:00,510
Before I broke the record
again with the dwell cursor

10762
07:57:00,509 --> 07:57:05,250
was I think on a 35 by 35 grid
with left and right click.

10763
07:57:05,250 --> 07:57:09,569
And you get more BPS, more bits per second

10764
07:57:09,569 --> 07:57:12,150
using multiple clicks
'cause it's more difficult.

10765
07:57:12,150 --> 07:57:14,159
- Oh, because what is it,

10766
07:57:14,159 --> 07:57:16,169
you're supposed to do either a left click

10767
07:57:16,169 --> 07:57:17,909
or a like right click?

10768
07:57:17,909 --> 07:57:19,470
You use a different color
for stuff like this?

10769
07:57:19,470 --> 07:57:21,330
- Yeah, blue targets for left click;

10770
07:57:21,330 --> 07:57:22,943
orange targets for right
click is what they had done.

10771
07:57:22,942 --> 07:57:26,459
- Got it.
- So my previous record of 7.5

10772
07:57:26,459 --> 07:57:29,309
was with the blue and
the orange targets, yeah,

10773
07:57:29,310 --> 07:57:32,920
which I think if I went back to that now

10774
07:57:33,900 --> 07:57:35,300
doing the click calibration,

10775
07:57:36,150 --> 07:57:38,490
and being able to like
initiate clicks on my own,

10776
07:57:38,490 --> 07:57:40,920
I think I would would
break that 10 ceiling

10777
07:57:40,919 --> 07:57:43,469
like in a couple days max.

10778
07:57:43,470 --> 07:57:45,960
- Like yeah, you would
start making Bliss nervous

10779
07:57:45,959 --> 07:57:47,826
about his 17-
- You should be.

10780
07:57:47,827 --> 07:57:49,600
- Why do you think we
haven't given him the-

10781
07:57:49,599 --> 07:57:50,432
- Yeah, exactly.

10782
07:57:52,513 --> 07:57:54,809
So what did it feel like
with the retractions?

10783
07:57:54,810 --> 07:57:57,330
That some of the threads retracted?

10784
07:57:57,330 --> 07:57:58,530
- It sucked.

10785
07:57:58,529 --> 07:58:00,719
It was really, really hard.

10786
07:58:00,720 --> 07:58:05,720
The day they told me was the
day of my big Neuralink tour

10787
07:58:07,889 --> 07:58:10,409
at their Fremont
facility, and they told me

10788
07:58:10,409 --> 07:58:12,060
like right before we went over there.

10789
07:58:12,060 --> 07:58:13,590
It was really hard to hear.

10790
07:58:13,590 --> 07:58:16,279
My initial reaction was,
"Alright, go in, fix it.

10791
07:58:16,279 --> 07:58:18,539
Like go in, take it out, and fix it."

10792
07:58:18,540 --> 07:58:20,247
The first surgery was so easy.

10793
07:58:20,247 --> 07:58:21,750
Like I went to sleep.

10794
07:58:21,750 --> 07:58:24,720
A couple hours later, I
woke up and here we are.

10795
07:58:24,720 --> 07:58:26,310
I didn't feel any pain,

10796
07:58:26,310 --> 07:58:29,850
didn't take like any
pain pills or anything.

10797
07:58:29,849 --> 07:58:34,319
So I just knew that if they
wanted to, they could go in

10798
07:58:34,319 --> 07:58:38,369
and put in a new one like next
day if that's what it took,

10799
07:58:38,369 --> 07:58:41,520
'cause I wanted it to be better

10800
07:58:41,520 --> 07:58:45,630
and I wanted not to lose the capability.

10801
07:58:45,630 --> 07:58:49,409
I had so much fun playing with it

10802
07:58:49,409 --> 07:58:51,122
for a few weeks, for a month.

10803
07:58:52,618 --> 07:58:54,389
It had opened up so many doors for me.

10804
07:58:54,389 --> 07:58:56,459
It had opened up so
many more possibilities

10805
07:58:56,459 --> 07:58:58,649
that I didn't want to
lose it after a month.

10806
07:58:58,650 --> 07:59:01,710
I thought it would've
been a cruel twist of fate

10807
07:59:01,709 --> 07:59:06,360
if I had gotten to see the view

10808
07:59:06,360 --> 07:59:08,010
from like the top of this mountain

10809
07:59:08,009 --> 07:59:11,069
and then have it all come
crashing down after a month.

10810
07:59:11,069 --> 07:59:13,200
And I knew like, say,
the top of the mountain,

10811
07:59:13,200 --> 07:59:18,150
but how I saw it was I was just now

10812
07:59:18,150 --> 07:59:19,700
starting to climb the mountain.

10813
07:59:21,479 --> 07:59:23,577
There was so much more
that I knew was possible.

10814
07:59:23,577 --> 07:59:25,710
And so to have all of that be taken away

10815
07:59:25,709 --> 07:59:26,909
was really, really hard.

10816
07:59:29,099 --> 07:59:32,699
But then on the drive
over to the facility,

10817
07:59:32,700 --> 07:59:35,350
I don't know, like five
minute drive, whatever it is,

10818
07:59:36,630 --> 07:59:39,600
I talked with my parents about it.

10819
07:59:39,599 --> 07:59:40,919
I prayed about it.

10820
07:59:40,919 --> 07:59:44,369
I was just like, "I'm not
gonna let this ruin my day.

10821
07:59:44,369 --> 07:59:48,419
I'm not gonna let this
ruin this amazing like tour

10822
07:59:48,419 --> 07:59:49,859
that they have set up for me.

10823
07:59:49,860 --> 07:59:52,200
Like I wanna go show everyone

10824
07:59:52,200 --> 07:59:54,510
how much I appreciate all
the work they're doing.

10825
07:59:54,509 --> 07:59:56,849
I wanna go like meet all of the people

10826
07:59:56,849 --> 07:59:58,379
who have made this possible,

10827
07:59:58,380 --> 08:00:01,080
and I wanna go have one of
the best days of my life."

10828
08:00:01,080 --> 08:00:03,090
And I did, and it was amazing,

10829
08:00:03,090 --> 08:00:06,209
and it absolutely was one of the best days

10830
08:00:06,209 --> 08:00:10,110
I've ever been privileged to experience.

10831
08:00:10,110 --> 08:00:13,799
And then for a few days, I
was pretty down in the dumps.

10832
08:00:13,799 --> 08:00:18,630
But for like the first few days
afterwards, I was just like,

10833
08:00:18,630 --> 08:00:21,203
I didn't know if it was
gonna ever gonna work again.

10834
08:00:23,130 --> 08:00:27,670
I made the decision that
even if I lost the ability

10835
08:00:30,119 --> 08:00:32,913
to use the Neuralink, even if I lost,

10836
08:00:33,930 --> 08:00:37,319
even if I like lost out
on everything to come,

10837
08:00:37,319 --> 08:00:39,989
if I could keep giving
them data in any way,

10838
08:00:39,990 --> 08:00:41,040
then I would do that.

10839
08:00:41,040 --> 08:00:43,709
If I needed to just do

10840
08:00:43,709 --> 08:00:45,090
like some of the data collection every day

10841
08:00:45,090 --> 08:00:48,212
or body mapping every day for
a year, then I would do it,

10842
08:00:49,080 --> 08:00:53,100
because I know that everything I'm doing

10843
08:00:53,099 --> 08:00:55,199
helps everyone to come after me.

10844
08:00:55,200 --> 08:00:56,393
And that's all I wanted.

10845
08:00:56,393 --> 08:00:59,909
I guess the whole reason that
I did this was to help people,

10846
08:00:59,909 --> 08:01:02,099
and I knew that anything
I could do to help,

10847
08:01:02,099 --> 08:01:03,809
I would continue to do,

10848
08:01:03,810 --> 08:01:06,150
even if I never got to
use the cursor again,

10849
08:01:06,150 --> 08:01:09,630
then I was just happy to be a part of it.

10850
08:01:09,630 --> 08:01:12,720
And everything that I'd
done was just a perk.

10851
08:01:12,720 --> 08:01:14,367
It was something that I got to experience,

10852
08:01:14,366 --> 08:01:15,899
and I know how amazing it's gonna be

10853
08:01:15,900 --> 08:01:16,890
for everyone to come after me.

10854
08:01:16,889 --> 08:01:20,972
So might as well just keep trucking along.

10855
08:01:22,269 --> 08:01:24,810
- Well, that said, you were able to get

10856
08:01:24,810 --> 08:01:27,450
to work your way up, to
get the performance back.

10857
08:01:27,450 --> 08:01:30,060
So this is like going from
rocky one to rocky two.

10858
08:01:30,060 --> 08:01:34,050
So when did you first realize
that this is possible,

10859
08:01:34,049 --> 08:01:35,969
and what gave you sort of the strength

10860
08:01:35,970 --> 08:01:38,790
and motivation, determination to do it?

10861
08:01:38,790 --> 08:01:42,916
To increase back up and
beat your previous record?

10862
08:01:42,916 --> 08:01:44,430
- Yeah, it was within a couple weeks.

10863
08:01:44,430 --> 08:01:45,810
- Again, this feels like I'm interviewing

10864
08:01:45,810 --> 08:01:47,550
an athlete. (laughs)

10865
08:01:47,549 --> 08:01:48,989
This is great.

10866
08:01:48,990 --> 08:01:50,909
I like to thank my parents.

10867
08:01:50,909 --> 08:01:53,430
- The road back was long and hard,

10868
08:01:53,430 --> 08:01:55,200
fraught many difficulties.

10869
08:01:55,200 --> 08:01:56,523
There were dark days.

10870
08:01:59,549 --> 08:02:02,099
It was a couple weeks, I think.

10871
08:02:02,099 --> 08:02:04,349
And then there was just a turning point.

10872
08:02:04,349 --> 08:02:09,340
I think they had switched
how they were measuring

10873
08:02:10,319 --> 08:02:11,882
the neuron spikes in my brain.

10874
08:02:12,959 --> 08:02:14,132
Bliss, help me out.

10875
08:02:15,119 --> 08:02:16,799
- [Bliss] Yeah, the way
in which we're measuring

10876
08:02:16,799 --> 08:02:18,180
the behavior of individual neurons.

10877
08:02:18,180 --> 08:02:19,979
- Yeah.
- So we're switching from

10878
08:02:19,979 --> 08:02:21,299
sort of individual spike detection

10879
08:02:21,299 --> 08:02:22,919
to something called spike band power,

10880
08:02:22,919 --> 08:02:24,779
which if you watch the previous segments

10881
08:02:24,779 --> 08:02:26,399
with either me or DJ, you
probably have some content.

10882
08:02:26,400 --> 08:02:30,300
- Yeah, okay, so when they
did that, it was kind of like,

10883
08:02:30,299 --> 08:02:32,939
a light over the head,
like light bulb moment.

10884
08:02:32,939 --> 08:02:34,409
Like, "Oh, this works."

10885
08:02:34,409 --> 08:02:39,150
And this seems like we can run with this.

10886
08:02:39,150 --> 08:02:44,130
And I saw the uptick in
performance immediately.

10887
08:02:44,130 --> 08:02:45,900
Like I could feel it
when they switched over.

10888
08:02:45,900 --> 08:02:47,159
I was like, "This is better.

10889
08:02:47,159 --> 08:02:48,299
Like this is good."

10890
08:02:48,299 --> 08:02:50,219
Like everything up till this point

10891
08:02:50,220 --> 08:02:51,240
for the last few weeks,

10892
08:02:51,240 --> 08:02:53,100
last like whatever, three or four weeks,

10893
08:02:53,099 --> 08:02:54,779
'cause it was before they even told me,

10894
08:02:54,779 --> 08:02:56,819
like everything before this sucked.

10895
08:02:56,819 --> 08:02:59,069
Like let's keep doing
what we're doing now.

10896
08:02:59,069 --> 08:03:01,717
And at that point, it was not like,

10897
08:03:01,717 --> 08:03:03,840
"Oh, I know I'm still only at,

10898
08:03:03,840 --> 08:03:05,729
like saying Webgrid terms,

10899
08:03:05,729 --> 08:03:09,659
like four or five BPS
compared to my 7.5 before.

10900
08:03:09,659 --> 08:03:12,180
But I know that if we keep doing this,

10901
08:03:12,180 --> 08:03:16,020
then like I can get back there."

10902
08:03:16,020 --> 08:03:17,639
And then they gave me the dwell cursor,

10903
08:03:17,639 --> 08:03:20,040
and the dwell cursor sucked at first.

10904
08:03:20,040 --> 08:03:22,020
It's not, obviously, not what I want,

10905
08:03:22,020 --> 08:03:26,130
but it gave me a path forward

10906
08:03:26,130 --> 08:03:27,900
to be able to continue using it,

10907
08:03:27,900 --> 08:03:31,050
and hopefully, to continue to help out.

10908
08:03:31,049 --> 08:03:34,200
And so I just ran with
it, never looked back.

10909
08:03:34,200 --> 08:03:35,583
Like I said, I'm just kind of person

10910
08:03:35,582 --> 08:03:37,709
that roll with the punches anyways.

10911
08:03:37,709 --> 08:03:39,750
- What was the process?

10912
08:03:39,750 --> 08:03:41,790
What was the feedback
loop on the figuring out

10913
08:03:41,790 --> 08:03:42,930
how to do the spike detection

10914
08:03:42,930 --> 08:03:45,060
in a way that would actually
work well for Noland?

10915
08:03:45,060 --> 08:03:45,930
- Yeah, it's a great question.

10916
08:03:45,930 --> 08:03:49,439
So maybe just describe first
how the actual update worked.

10917
08:03:49,439 --> 08:03:50,759
It was basically an
update to your implant.

10918
08:03:50,759 --> 08:03:53,009
So we just did an over
the air software update

10919
08:03:53,009 --> 08:03:54,840
to his implants, same way
you'd update your Tesla

10920
08:03:54,840 --> 08:03:58,080
or your iPhone, and that
firmware change enabled us

10921
08:03:58,080 --> 08:04:01,200
to record sort of averages of populations

10922
08:04:01,200 --> 08:04:02,670
of neurons nearby individual electrodes.

10923
08:04:02,669 --> 08:04:04,829
So we have sort of less resolution

10924
08:04:04,830 --> 08:04:06,810
about which individual
neuron is doing what,

10925
08:04:06,810 --> 08:04:08,640
but we have a broader
picture of what's going on

10926
08:04:08,639 --> 08:04:10,439
nearby an electrode overall.

10927
08:04:10,439 --> 08:04:12,899
And that feedback, I mean, basically,

10928
08:04:12,900 --> 08:04:14,040
Noland described it was immediate

10929
08:04:14,040 --> 08:04:15,540
when we flipped that switch.

10930
08:04:15,540 --> 08:04:16,647
I think the first day we did that,

10931
08:04:16,647 --> 08:04:18,870
you had three or four
BPS right out of the box.

10932
08:04:18,869 --> 08:04:20,646
And that was a light bulb moment for,

10933
08:04:20,647 --> 08:04:22,560
"Okay, this is the right path to go down."

10934
08:04:22,560 --> 08:04:24,600
And from there, there's
a lot of feedback around

10935
08:04:24,599 --> 08:04:26,812
like how to make this
useful for independent use.

10936
08:04:26,812 --> 08:04:28,799
So what we care about ultimately is that

10937
08:04:28,799 --> 08:04:31,169
you can use it independently
to do whatever you want.

10938
08:04:31,169 --> 08:04:32,849
And to get to that point, it required us

10939
08:04:32,849 --> 08:04:35,609
to re-engineer the UX, as you
talked about the dwell cursor,

10940
08:04:35,610 --> 08:04:37,080
to make it something that
you can use independently

10941
08:04:37,080 --> 08:04:39,150
without us needing to be
involved all the time.

10942
08:04:39,150 --> 08:04:41,310
And yeah, this is obviously the
start of this journey still.

10943
08:04:41,310 --> 08:04:43,350
Hopefully, we get back to
the places where you're doing

10944
08:04:43,349 --> 08:04:46,169
multiple clicks and using that to control

10945
08:04:46,169 --> 08:04:47,399
much more fluidly, everything,

10946
08:04:47,400 --> 08:04:49,200
and much more naturally, the applications

10947
08:04:49,200 --> 08:04:51,141
that you're trying to interface with.

10948
08:04:51,141 --> 08:04:55,290
- And most importantly,
get that Webgrid number up.

10949
08:04:55,290 --> 08:04:57,130
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10950
08:04:57,130 --> 08:04:59,583
So how is the, on the hover click,

10951
08:05:00,509 --> 08:05:02,489
do you accidentally click cells sometimes?

10952
08:05:02,490 --> 08:05:05,700
Like how hard is it to
avoid accidentally clicking?

10953
08:05:05,700 --> 08:05:09,690
- I have to continuously
keep it moving, basically.

10954
08:05:09,689 --> 08:05:11,250
So like I said, there's a threshold

10955
08:05:11,250 --> 08:05:13,020
where it will initiate a click.

10956
08:05:13,020 --> 08:05:16,740
So if I ever drop below that, it'll start,

10957
08:05:16,740 --> 08:05:20,686
and I have 0.3 seconds to move
it before it clicks anything.

10958
08:05:20,686 --> 08:05:22,470
And if I don't want it to ever get there,

10959
08:05:22,470 --> 08:05:24,930
I just keep it moving at a certain speed,

10960
08:05:24,930 --> 08:05:28,049
and like just constantly
like doing circles on screen,

10961
08:05:28,049 --> 08:05:31,380
moving it back and forth to
keep it from clicking stuff.

10962
08:05:31,380 --> 08:05:35,793
I actually noticed a couple weeks back,

10963
08:05:36,779 --> 08:05:39,299
when I was not using the implant,

10964
08:05:39,299 --> 08:05:43,649
I was just moving my hand
back and forth or in circles.

10965
08:05:43,650 --> 08:05:46,740
Like I was trying to keep
the cursor from clicking,

10966
08:05:46,740 --> 08:05:48,840
and I was just doing it
like while I was trying

10967
08:05:48,840 --> 08:05:51,098
to go to sleep, and I was like,
"Okay, this is a problem."

10968
08:05:51,098 --> 08:05:52,740
(both laughing)

10969
08:05:52,740 --> 08:05:53,610
- To avoid the clicking.

10970
08:05:53,610 --> 08:05:56,430
I guess, does that create
problems like when you're gaming

10971
08:05:56,430 --> 08:05:58,380
accidentally click a thing?

10972
08:05:58,380 --> 08:06:00,723
- Yeah, yeah, it happens in chess.

10973
08:06:02,340 --> 08:06:04,709
I've lost a number of games

10974
08:06:04,709 --> 08:06:06,689
because I'll accidentally click something.

10975
08:06:06,689 --> 08:06:08,039
- [Bliss] I think the
first time I ever beat you

10976
08:06:08,040 --> 08:06:10,156
was because of an accident.
- Yeah, I misclicked, yeah.

10977
08:06:10,156 --> 08:06:11,729
- It's a nice excuse, right?

10978
08:06:11,729 --> 08:06:12,562
- Yeah.
- You can always,

10979
08:06:12,562 --> 08:06:14,519
anytime you lose-
- You could just say-

10980
08:06:14,520 --> 08:06:16,529
- That was accidental.
- Yeah.

10981
08:06:16,529 --> 08:06:20,789
- You said the app improved
a lot from version one.

10982
08:06:20,790 --> 08:06:23,310
When you first started using
it, it was very different.

10983
08:06:23,310 --> 08:06:26,850
So can you just talk
about the trial and error

10984
08:06:26,849 --> 08:06:28,019
that you went through with the team?

10985
08:06:28,020 --> 08:06:30,450
Like 200 plus pages of notes.

10986
08:06:30,450 --> 08:06:32,130
What's that process like of-

10987
08:06:32,130 --> 08:06:34,260
- Yeah.
- Going back and forth

10988
08:06:34,259 --> 08:06:36,032
and working together to improve the thing?

10989
08:06:36,032 --> 08:06:41,032
- It's a lot of me just using
it like day in and day out

10990
08:06:41,487 --> 08:06:45,630
and saying, like, "Hey, can
you guys do this for me?

10991
08:06:45,630 --> 08:06:46,500
Like give me this.

10992
08:06:46,500 --> 08:06:48,630
I wanna be able to do that.

10993
08:06:48,630 --> 08:06:51,000
I need this."

10994
08:06:51,000 --> 08:06:56,000
I think a lot of it just
doesn't occur to them maybe

10995
08:06:56,340 --> 08:06:58,889
until someone is actually using the app,

10996
08:06:58,889 --> 08:07:00,149
using the implant.

10997
08:07:00,150 --> 08:07:01,860
It's just something that

10998
08:07:01,860 --> 08:07:03,420
they just never would've thought of.

10999
08:07:03,419 --> 08:07:08,419
Or it's very specific to even like me,

11000
08:07:08,490 --> 08:07:09,750
maybe what I want.

11001
08:07:09,750 --> 08:07:11,759
It's something I'm a little worried about

11002
08:07:11,759 --> 08:07:13,169
with the next people that come

11003
08:07:13,169 --> 08:07:18,169
is maybe they will want
things much different

11004
08:07:18,479 --> 08:07:19,799
than how I've set it up,

11005
08:07:19,799 --> 08:07:22,259
or what the advice I've given the team.

11006
08:07:22,259 --> 08:07:24,840
And they're gonna look
at some of the things

11007
08:07:24,840 --> 08:07:26,159
they've added for me.

11008
08:07:26,159 --> 08:07:27,450
Like that's a dumb idea.

11009
08:07:27,450 --> 08:07:29,000
Like why would he ask for that?

11010
08:07:30,349 --> 08:07:33,329
And so I'm really looking
forward to get the next people on

11011
08:07:33,330 --> 08:07:36,030
because I guarantee that
they're going to think of things

11012
08:07:36,029 --> 08:07:37,529
that I've never thought of.

11013
08:07:37,529 --> 08:07:39,239
They're gonna think of improvements.

11014
08:07:39,240 --> 08:07:40,860
I'm like, "Wow, that's a really good idea.

11015
08:07:40,860 --> 08:07:43,440
Like I wish I would've thought of that."

11016
08:07:43,439 --> 08:07:45,899
And then they're also
gonna give me some pushback

11017
08:07:45,900 --> 08:07:48,993
about like, "Yeah, what you
are asking them to do here,

11018
08:07:49,830 --> 08:07:50,880
that's a bad idea.

11019
08:07:50,880 --> 08:07:52,139
Let's do it this way."

11020
08:07:52,139 --> 08:07:55,079
And I'm more than happy
to have that happen.

11021
08:07:55,080 --> 08:07:58,860
But it's just a lot of
like different interactions

11022
08:07:58,860 --> 08:08:03,270
with different games or applications,

11023
08:08:03,270 --> 08:08:05,790
the internet, just with
the computer in general.

11024
08:08:05,790 --> 08:08:07,799
There's tons of bugs

11025
08:08:07,799 --> 08:08:11,700
that end up popping up
left, right, center.

11026
08:08:11,700 --> 08:08:14,760
So it's just me trying to
use it as much as possible

11027
08:08:14,759 --> 08:08:17,129
and showing them what
works and what doesn't work

11028
08:08:17,130 --> 08:08:18,750
and what I would like to be better.

11029
08:08:18,750 --> 08:08:21,959
And then they take that feedback,

11030
08:08:21,959 --> 08:08:24,959
and they usually create
amazing things for me.

11031
08:08:24,959 --> 08:08:28,829
They solve these problems in
ways I would've never imagined.

11032
08:08:28,830 --> 08:08:30,730
They're so good at everything they do.

11033
08:08:32,279 --> 08:08:33,509
And so I'm just really thankful

11034
08:08:33,509 --> 08:08:35,279
that I'm able to give them feedback

11035
08:08:35,279 --> 08:08:36,287
and they can make something of it,

11036
08:08:36,287 --> 08:08:40,139
'cause a lot of my feedback
is like really dumb.

11037
08:08:40,139 --> 08:08:42,299
It's just like, "I want this.

11038
08:08:42,299 --> 08:08:43,799
Please do something about it."

11039
08:08:43,799 --> 08:08:46,860
And we'll come back and
super well thought out,

11040
08:08:46,860 --> 08:08:48,569
and it's way better than anything

11041
08:08:48,569 --> 08:08:51,209
I could have ever thought
of or implemented myself.

11042
08:08:51,209 --> 08:08:52,439
So they're just great.

11043
08:08:52,439 --> 08:08:53,669
They're really, really cool.

11044
08:08:53,669 --> 08:08:58,669
- As the BCI community grows,
would you like to hang out

11045
08:08:58,889 --> 08:09:01,139
with the other folks with Neuralink?

11046
08:09:01,139 --> 08:09:03,959
What relationship, if any,
would you wanna have with them?

11047
08:09:03,959 --> 08:09:05,819
Because you said like they
might have a different

11048
08:09:05,819 --> 08:09:10,020
set of like ideas of how to use the thing.

11049
08:09:10,020 --> 08:09:11,490
- Yeah.
- Would you be intimidated

11050
08:09:11,490 --> 08:09:13,470
by their Webgrid performance?

11051
08:09:13,470 --> 08:09:15,120
- No, no, I hope compete.

11052
08:09:15,119 --> 08:09:19,289
I hope day one, they like
wipe the floor with me.

11053
08:09:19,290 --> 08:09:23,459
I hope they beat it and they crush it.

11054
08:09:23,459 --> 08:09:24,812
Double it if they can.

11055
08:09:25,709 --> 08:09:27,959
Just because, on one hand,

11056
08:09:27,959 --> 08:09:30,059
it's only gonna push me to be better,

11057
08:09:30,060 --> 08:09:31,290
'cause I'm super competitive.

11058
08:09:31,290 --> 08:09:34,470
I want other people to push me.

11059
08:09:34,470 --> 08:09:39,090
I think that is important
for anyone trying to achieve

11060
08:09:39,090 --> 08:09:41,310
greatness is they need
other people around them

11061
08:09:41,310 --> 08:09:43,620
who are going to push them to be better.

11062
08:09:43,619 --> 08:09:46,619
And I even made a joke about it on X once.

11063
08:09:46,619 --> 08:09:48,840
Like once the next people get chosen,

11064
08:09:48,840 --> 08:09:52,259
like qubadi cot music, like
I'm just excited to have

11065
08:09:52,259 --> 08:09:54,000
other people to do this with

11066
08:09:54,000 --> 08:09:55,860
and to like share experiences with.

11067
08:09:55,860 --> 08:09:57,150
I'm more than happy to interact

11068
08:09:57,150 --> 08:09:58,620
with them as much as they want,

11069
08:09:58,619 --> 08:10:01,500
more than happy to give them advice.

11070
08:10:01,500 --> 08:10:03,330
I don't know what kind of
advice I could give them,

11071
08:10:03,330 --> 08:10:05,640
but if they have questions,
I'm more than happy.

11072
08:10:05,639 --> 08:10:06,779
- What advice would you have

11073
08:10:06,779 --> 08:10:10,289
for the next participant
in the clinical trial?

11074
08:10:10,290 --> 08:10:12,810
- That they should have fun with this,

11075
08:10:12,810 --> 08:10:15,063
because it is a lot of fun.

11076
08:10:15,930 --> 08:10:19,080
And that I hope they
work really, really hard,

11077
08:10:19,080 --> 08:10:21,240
because it's not just for us,

11078
08:10:21,240 --> 08:10:23,253
it's for everyone that comes after us.

11079
08:10:24,299 --> 08:10:28,380
And come to me if they need anything.

11080
08:10:28,380 --> 08:10:30,810
And to go to Neuralink
if they need anything.

11081
08:10:30,810 --> 08:10:33,060
Man, Neuralink moves mountains.

11082
08:10:33,060 --> 08:10:36,990
Like they do absolutely
anything for me that they can.

11083
08:10:36,990 --> 08:10:41,070
And it's an amazing
support system to have.

11084
08:10:41,069 --> 08:10:46,069
It puts my mind at ease
for like so many things

11085
08:10:46,319 --> 08:10:48,829
that I have had like questions about,

11086
08:10:48,830 --> 08:10:50,640
or so many things I wanna do.

11087
08:10:50,639 --> 08:10:54,062
And they're always there, and
that's really, really nice.

11088
08:10:56,159 --> 08:10:58,349
I would tell them not to be
afraid to go to Neuralink

11089
08:10:58,349 --> 08:11:01,559
with any questions that
they have, any concerns,

11090
08:11:01,560 --> 08:11:04,500
anything that they're
looking to do with this.

11091
08:11:04,500 --> 08:11:07,169
And any help that Neuralink
is capable of providing,

11092
08:11:07,169 --> 08:11:08,282
I know they will.

11093
08:11:09,659 --> 08:11:12,720
And I don't know, I don't know.

11094
08:11:12,720 --> 08:11:17,130
Just work your ass off,
because it's really important

11095
08:11:17,130 --> 08:11:20,190
that we try to give our all to this.

11096
08:11:20,189 --> 08:11:21,840
- So have fun and work hard.

11097
08:11:21,840 --> 08:11:23,340
- Yeah, yeah, there we go.

11098
08:11:23,340 --> 08:11:25,049
Maybe that's what I'll just
start saying to people:

11099
08:11:25,049 --> 08:11:26,309
have fun, work hard.

11100
08:11:26,310 --> 08:11:27,750
- Now, you're a real pro athlete.

11101
08:11:27,750 --> 08:11:31,799
Just keep it short.
(Noland laughing)

11102
08:11:31,799 --> 08:11:36,630
Maybe it's good to talk about
what you've been able to do

11103
08:11:36,630 --> 08:11:38,506
now that you have a Neuralink implant.

11104
08:11:38,506 --> 08:11:41,729
Like the freedom you gain

11105
08:11:41,729 --> 08:11:44,759
from this way of interacting
with the outside world.

11106
08:11:44,759 --> 08:11:47,669
Like you play video games all night.

11107
08:11:47,669 --> 08:11:49,949
And you do that by yourself.

11108
08:11:49,950 --> 08:11:51,420
And that's a kind of freedom.

11109
08:11:51,419 --> 08:11:52,949
Can you speak to that
freedom that you gain?

11110
08:11:52,950 --> 08:11:56,580
- Yeah, it's what all, I don't know,

11111
08:11:56,580 --> 08:11:57,930
people in my position want.

11112
08:11:57,930 --> 08:11:59,670
They just want more independence.

11113
08:11:59,669 --> 08:12:01,469
The more load that I can take away

11114
08:12:01,470 --> 08:12:03,810
from people around me, the better.

11115
08:12:03,810 --> 08:12:06,960
If I'm able to interact with the world

11116
08:12:06,959 --> 08:12:09,299
without using my family,

11117
08:12:09,299 --> 08:12:12,930
without going through any of my friends,

11118
08:12:12,930 --> 08:12:15,990
like needing them to help
me with things, the better.

11119
08:12:15,990 --> 08:12:19,230
If I'm able to sit up
on my computer all night

11120
08:12:19,229 --> 08:12:23,489
and not need someone to like sit me up,

11121
08:12:23,490 --> 08:12:27,120
say like on my iPad, like in
a position where I can use it

11122
08:12:27,119 --> 08:12:29,579
and then have to have them wait up for me

11123
08:12:29,580 --> 08:12:31,880
all night until I'm ready
to be done using it,

11124
08:12:33,840 --> 08:12:36,060
it takes a load off of all of us.

11125
08:12:36,060 --> 08:12:40,173
And it's really like all I can ask for.

11126
08:12:40,172 --> 08:12:41,439
It's something that

11127
08:12:42,869 --> 08:12:44,879
I could never thank Neuralink enough for.

11128
08:12:44,880 --> 08:12:46,880
And I know my family feels the same way.

11129
08:12:49,049 --> 08:12:53,489
Just being able to have the
freedom to do things on my own

11130
08:12:53,490 --> 08:12:58,080
at any hour of the day or
night, it means the world to me.

11131
08:12:58,080 --> 08:13:02,730
And I don't know.

11132
08:13:02,729 --> 08:13:07,729
- When you're up at 2:00 AM
playing Webgrid by yourself,

11133
08:13:07,830 --> 08:13:09,840
I just imagine like it's darkness

11134
08:13:09,840 --> 08:13:11,985
and there's just a light glowing.

11135
08:13:11,985 --> 08:13:12,990
And you're just focused.

11136
08:13:12,990 --> 08:13:15,340
What's going through your mind?

11137
08:13:15,340 --> 08:13:18,060
(Noland laughing)

11138
08:13:18,060 --> 08:13:19,710
Or you were like in a state of flow

11139
08:13:19,709 --> 08:13:21,180
where it's like the mind is empty,

11140
08:13:21,180 --> 08:13:22,560
like those like Zen masters?

11141
08:13:22,560 --> 08:13:26,760
- Yeah, generally, it is me
playing music of some sort.

11142
08:13:26,759 --> 08:13:28,349
I have a massive playlist,

11143
08:13:28,349 --> 08:13:30,869
and so I'm just like rocking out to music.

11144
08:13:30,869 --> 08:13:34,606
And then it's also just
like a race against time,

11145
08:13:34,606 --> 08:13:37,709
'cause I'm constantly looking at

11146
08:13:37,709 --> 08:13:41,639
how much battery percentage
I have left on my implant.

11147
08:13:41,639 --> 08:13:44,189
Like, all right, I have 30%,

11148
08:13:44,189 --> 08:13:46,799
which equates to x amount of time,

11149
08:13:46,799 --> 08:13:48,959
which means I have to break this record

11150
08:13:48,959 --> 08:13:50,700
in the next hour and a half,

11151
08:13:50,700 --> 08:13:52,500
or else, it's not happening tonight.

11152
08:13:53,520 --> 08:13:57,788
And so it's a little
stressful when that happens.

11153
08:13:57,788 --> 08:14:00,667
When it's above 50%, I'm
like, "Okay, like I got time."

11154
08:14:00,667 --> 08:14:03,870
It starts getting down to 30 and then 20.

11155
08:14:03,869 --> 08:14:06,239
It's like, all right, 10%,

11156
08:14:06,240 --> 08:14:07,677
a little popup is gonna pop up right here,

11157
08:14:07,676 --> 08:14:10,229
and it's gonna really
screw my Webgrid flow.

11158
08:14:10,229 --> 08:14:14,069
It's gonna tell me that
there's like the low battery,

11159
08:14:14,069 --> 08:14:15,782
low battery popup comes up, and I'm like,

11160
08:14:15,782 --> 08:14:17,189
it's really gonna screw me over.

11161
08:14:17,189 --> 08:14:19,859
So if I have to, if I'm
gonna break this record,

11162
08:14:19,860 --> 08:14:22,200
I have to do it in the
next like 30 seconds,

11163
08:14:22,200 --> 08:14:23,790
or else, that popup is
gonna get in the way,

11164
08:14:23,790 --> 08:14:24,889
like cover my Webgrid.

11165
08:14:26,639 --> 08:14:28,590
After that, I go click on
it, go back into Webgrid.

11166
08:14:28,590 --> 08:14:30,509
And I'm like, "All
right, that means I have

11167
08:14:30,509 --> 08:14:33,299
10 minutes left before this thing's dead."

11168
08:14:33,299 --> 08:14:35,130
That's what's going on
in my head generally,

11169
08:14:35,130 --> 08:14:36,780
that and whatever song's playing.

11170
08:14:39,750 --> 08:14:42,630
I want to break those records so bad.

11171
08:14:42,630 --> 08:14:45,030
Like it's all I want
when I'm playing Webgrid.

11172
08:14:45,029 --> 08:14:47,552
It has become less of like,

11173
08:14:47,552 --> 08:14:49,889
"Oh, this is just a leisurely activity."

11174
08:14:49,889 --> 08:14:51,389
Like I just enjoy doing this,

11175
08:14:51,389 --> 08:14:54,630
because it just feels so
nice and it puts me at ease.

11176
08:14:54,630 --> 08:14:57,690
No, once I'm in Webgrid,
you better break this record

11177
08:14:57,689 --> 08:14:59,250
or you're gonna waste like five hours

11178
08:14:59,250 --> 08:15:00,720
of your life right now.

11179
08:15:00,720 --> 08:15:04,530
And I don't know, it's just fun.

11180
08:15:04,529 --> 08:15:05,639
It's fun, man.

11181
08:15:05,639 --> 08:15:06,750
- Have you ever tried Webgrid

11182
08:15:06,750 --> 08:15:08,520
with like two targets and three targets?

11183
08:15:08,520 --> 08:15:10,560
Can you get higher BPS with that?

11184
08:15:10,560 --> 08:15:12,270
- Can you do that?

11185
08:15:12,270 --> 08:15:13,650
- [Bliss] You mean, like
different color targets,

11186
08:15:13,650 --> 08:15:15,368
or you mean-
- Oh, multiple targets,

11187
08:15:15,367 --> 08:15:16,495
'cause that change the thing.

11188
08:15:16,495 --> 08:15:18,840
- Yeah, so BPS is a log
of number of targets

11189
08:15:18,840 --> 08:15:21,237
times correct minus
incorrect divided by time.

11190
08:15:21,237 --> 08:15:23,159
And so you can think of
like different clicks

11191
08:15:23,159 --> 08:15:25,799
as basically doubling the
number of active targets.

11192
08:15:25,799 --> 08:15:26,663
- Got it.
- So you know,

11193
08:15:26,663 --> 08:15:28,917
you get basically higher BPS,
the more options there are,

11194
08:15:28,917 --> 08:15:30,720
the more difficult to task.

11195
08:15:30,720 --> 08:15:33,060
And there's also like zen
mode you've played in before,

11196
08:15:33,060 --> 08:15:34,810
which is like-
- Yeah.

11197
08:15:34,810 --> 08:15:38,040
Yeah, it covers the
whole screen with a grid.

11198
08:15:38,040 --> 08:15:40,620
And I don't know.

11199
08:15:40,619 --> 08:15:43,229
- [Lex] Yeah, and so you can go like,

11200
08:15:43,229 --> 08:15:45,180
that's insane.
- Yeah.

11201
08:15:45,180 --> 08:15:47,422
- [Bliss] He doesn't like it
'cause it didn't show BPS.

11202
08:15:49,380 --> 08:15:53,040
- I had them put in a giant
BPS in the background,

11203
08:15:53,040 --> 08:15:55,229
so now it's like the opposite of Zen mode.

11204
08:15:55,229 --> 08:15:59,754
It's like super hard mode,
like just metal mode.

11205
08:15:59,754 --> 08:16:01,470
It's just like a giant
number in the back counter.

11206
08:16:01,470 --> 08:16:02,302
- [Bliss] We should rename that.

11207
08:16:02,302 --> 08:16:04,012
Metal mode is a much better name now.

11208
08:16:05,159 --> 08:16:08,250
- So you also play Civilization VI?

11209
08:16:08,250 --> 08:16:09,990
- I love Civ VI, yeah.

11210
08:16:09,990 --> 08:16:11,490
- [Lex] You usually go with Korea,

11211
08:16:11,490 --> 08:16:12,990
you said?
- I do, yeah.

11212
08:16:12,990 --> 08:16:16,830
So the great part about
Korea is they focus on

11213
08:16:16,830 --> 08:16:20,100
like science tech victories,
which was not planned.

11214
08:16:20,099 --> 08:16:22,349
Like I've been playing Korea for years,

11215
08:16:22,349 --> 08:16:25,199
and then all of the
Neuralink stuff happened.

11216
08:16:25,200 --> 08:16:26,762
So it kind of aligned.

11217
08:16:28,590 --> 08:16:32,099
But what I've noticed with tech victories

11218
08:16:32,099 --> 08:16:37,099
is if you can just rush
tech, rush science,

11219
08:16:37,349 --> 08:16:39,629
then you can do anything.

11220
08:16:39,630 --> 08:16:41,430
Like at one point in the game,

11221
08:16:41,430 --> 08:16:44,939
you'll be so far ahead of
everyone technologically

11222
08:16:44,939 --> 08:16:49,319
that you'll have like
musket men, infantry men,

11223
08:16:49,319 --> 08:16:51,509
plane sometimes, and people
will still be fighting

11224
08:16:51,509 --> 08:16:53,039
with like bows and arrows.

11225
08:16:53,040 --> 08:16:56,310
And so if you want to
win a domination victory,

11226
08:16:56,310 --> 08:16:59,010
you just get to a certain
point with the science

11227
08:16:59,009 --> 08:17:01,590
and then go and wipe out
the rest of the world.

11228
08:17:01,590 --> 08:17:06,590
Or you can just take science
all the way and win that way,

11229
08:17:06,840 --> 08:17:08,670
and you're gonna be so
far ahead of everyone

11230
08:17:08,669 --> 08:17:10,049
'cause you're producing so much science

11231
08:17:10,049 --> 08:17:11,672
that it's not even close.

11232
08:17:12,869 --> 08:17:16,409
I've accidentally won in different ways

11233
08:17:16,409 --> 08:17:18,389
just by focusing on science.

11234
08:17:18,389 --> 08:17:20,489
- Accidentally won by focusing on science.

11235
08:17:21,810 --> 08:17:24,960
- I was playing only science, obviously.

11236
08:17:24,959 --> 08:17:27,750
Like just science all the way, just tech.

11237
08:17:27,750 --> 08:17:30,060
And I was trying to get like every tech

11238
08:17:30,060 --> 08:17:31,380
in the tech tree and stuff.

11239
08:17:31,380 --> 08:17:34,950
And then I accidentally won
through a diplomatic victory,

11240
08:17:34,950 --> 08:17:36,510
and I was so mad.
(Lex laughing)

11241
08:17:36,509 --> 08:17:38,579
I was so mad,

11242
08:17:38,580 --> 08:17:40,020
'cause it just like ends the game.

11243
08:17:40,020 --> 08:17:40,897
One turn, it was like,

11244
08:17:40,897 --> 08:17:42,780
"Oh, you won, you're so diplomatic."

11245
08:17:42,779 --> 08:17:43,829
I'm like, "I don't wanna do this.

11246
08:17:43,830 --> 08:17:47,370
I should have declared war
on more people or something."

11247
08:17:47,369 --> 08:17:49,680
It was terrible, but you don't need

11248
08:17:49,680 --> 08:17:52,830
like giant civilizations with
tech, especially with Korea.

11249
08:17:52,830 --> 08:17:54,300
You can keep it pretty small.

11250
08:17:54,299 --> 08:17:58,079
So I generally just get
to a certain military unit

11251
08:17:58,080 --> 08:18:01,590
and put them all around my
border to keep everyone out,

11252
08:18:01,590 --> 08:18:03,569
and then I will just build up.

11253
08:18:03,569 --> 08:18:05,610
So very isolationist.

11254
08:18:05,610 --> 08:18:06,442
- Nice.
- Yeah.

11255
08:18:06,442 --> 08:18:07,770
- Just work on the science and the tech.

11256
08:18:07,770 --> 08:18:08,909
- [Noland] Yep, that's it.

11257
08:18:08,909 --> 08:18:10,259
- You're making it sound so fun.

11258
08:18:10,259 --> 08:18:12,149
- It's so much fun.
- And I also saw

11259
08:18:12,150 --> 08:18:13,500
Civilization VII trailer.

11260
08:18:13,500 --> 08:18:14,426
- Oh man, I'm so pumped.
- Yeah.

11261
08:18:14,426 --> 08:18:16,200
And that's probably coming out-

11262
08:18:16,200 --> 08:18:18,180
- Come on, Civ VII, hit me up.

11263
08:18:18,180 --> 08:18:20,130
Alpha, beta tests, whatever.

11264
08:18:20,130 --> 08:18:21,120
- Wait, when is it coming out?

11265
08:18:21,119 --> 08:18:23,939
- 2025.
- Yeah, yeah, next year, yeah.

11266
08:18:23,939 --> 08:18:26,159
What other stuff would
you like to see improved

11267
08:18:26,159 --> 08:18:29,520
about the Neuralink app and
just the entire experience?

11268
08:18:29,520 --> 08:18:32,040
- I would like to, like I said,

11269
08:18:32,040 --> 08:18:36,030
get back to the like click on demand,

11270
08:18:36,029 --> 08:18:37,439
like the regular clicks.

11271
08:18:37,439 --> 08:18:38,579
That would be great.

11272
08:18:38,580 --> 08:18:42,630
I would like to be able to
connect to more devices.

11273
08:18:42,630 --> 08:18:44,280
Right now, it's just the computer.

11274
08:18:44,279 --> 08:18:47,189
I'd like to be able to use it on my phone

11275
08:18:47,189 --> 08:18:51,479
or use it on different
consoles, different platforms.

11276
08:18:51,479 --> 08:18:53,849
I'd like to be able to control

11277
08:18:53,849 --> 08:18:55,682
as much stuff as possible, honestly.

11278
08:18:57,119 --> 08:19:00,029
Like an Optimus robot
would be pretty cool.

11279
08:19:00,029 --> 08:19:03,509
That would be sick if I could
control an Optimus robot.

11280
08:19:03,509 --> 08:19:08,309
The Link app itself, it
seems like we are getting

11281
08:19:08,310 --> 08:19:13,310
pretty dialed in to what it
might look like down the road.

11282
08:19:16,650 --> 08:19:18,150
Seems like we've gotten through

11283
08:19:18,150 --> 08:19:21,600
a lot of what I want from it at least.

11284
08:19:21,599 --> 08:19:22,829
The only other thing I would say

11285
08:19:22,830 --> 08:19:26,850
is like more control
over all the parameters

11286
08:19:26,849 --> 08:19:31,849
that I can tweak with my
like cursor and stuff.

11287
08:19:32,520 --> 08:19:35,189
There's a lot of things that go into

11288
08:19:35,189 --> 08:19:38,250
how the cursor moves in certain ways.

11289
08:19:38,250 --> 08:19:41,040
And I have, I don't
know, like three or four

11290
08:19:41,040 --> 08:19:42,120
of those parameters and there might-

11291
08:19:42,119 --> 08:19:43,783
- Like gain and friction and all that?

11292
08:19:43,783 --> 08:19:44,939
- Gain and friction, yeah.

11293
08:19:44,939 --> 08:19:47,369
And there's maybe double
the amount of those

11294
08:19:47,369 --> 08:19:49,259
with just like velocity

11295
08:19:49,259 --> 08:19:52,349
and then with the actual dwell cursor.

11296
08:19:52,349 --> 08:19:54,149
So I would like all of it.

11297
08:19:54,150 --> 08:19:57,480
I want as much control over
my environment as possible,

11298
08:19:57,479 --> 08:19:58,739
especially-
- So you want like

11299
08:19:58,740 --> 08:20:00,008
advanced mode?

11300
08:20:00,008 --> 08:20:02,790
Like there's menus usually,
there's basic mode.

11301
08:20:02,790 --> 08:20:04,680
And you're like one of those folks like-

11302
08:20:04,680 --> 08:20:06,299
- I go the-
- Power user advanced.

11303
08:20:06,299 --> 08:20:07,439
- Yeah, yeah.
- Got it.

11304
08:20:07,439 --> 08:20:08,413
- That's what I want.

11305
08:20:08,413 --> 08:20:10,663
I want as much control
over this as possible.

11306
08:20:11,549 --> 08:20:13,770
So yeah, that's really all I can ask for.

11307
08:20:13,770 --> 08:20:15,903
Just give me everything.

11308
08:20:18,900 --> 08:20:20,700
- Has speech been useful?

11309
08:20:20,700 --> 08:20:22,200
Like just being able to talk also

11310
08:20:22,200 --> 08:20:23,610
in addition to everything else?

11311
08:20:23,610 --> 08:20:25,409
- Yeah, you mean like while I'm using it?

11312
08:20:25,409 --> 08:20:28,020
- While you're using
it, like speech to text?

11313
08:20:28,020 --> 08:20:29,537
- Oh yeah.
- Or do you type,

11314
08:20:29,537 --> 08:20:30,900
or like, 'cause there's also a keyboard?

11315
08:20:30,900 --> 08:20:31,733
That's really nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

11316
08:20:31,733 --> 08:20:32,580
So there's a virtual keyboard.

11317
08:20:32,580 --> 08:20:34,680
That's another thing I
would like to work more on

11318
08:20:34,680 --> 08:20:39,680
is finding some way to type
or text in a different way.

11319
08:20:40,259 --> 08:20:44,216
Right now, it is like
a dictation basically

11320
08:20:44,217 --> 08:20:47,069
and a virtual keyboard that
I can use with the cursor.

11321
08:20:47,069 --> 08:20:50,909
But we've played around
with like finger spelling,

11322
08:20:50,909 --> 08:20:53,430
like sign language, finger spelling.

11323
08:20:53,430 --> 08:20:55,439
And that seems really promising.

11324
08:20:55,439 --> 08:20:57,989
So I have this thought in my head

11325
08:20:57,990 --> 08:21:02,990
that it's going to be a
very similar learning curve

11326
08:21:03,000 --> 08:21:05,819
that I had with the cursor,

11327
08:21:05,819 --> 08:21:07,290
where I went from attempted movement

11328
08:21:07,290 --> 08:21:08,970
to imagined movement at one point.

11329
08:21:08,970 --> 08:21:12,000
I have a feeling, this
is just my intuition,

11330
08:21:12,000 --> 08:21:15,750
that at some point, I'm going
to be doing finger spelling

11331
08:21:15,750 --> 08:21:17,430
and I won't need to actually attempt

11332
08:21:17,430 --> 08:21:18,599
to finger spell anymore,

11333
08:21:18,599 --> 08:21:20,129
that I'll just be able to think

11334
08:21:20,130 --> 08:21:23,970
the like letter that I
want and it'll pop up.

11335
08:21:23,970 --> 08:21:25,409
- That would be epic.
- Yeah.

11336
08:21:25,409 --> 08:21:26,942
- That's challenging, that's hard.

11337
08:21:26,942 --> 08:21:30,059
That's a lot of work for
you to kinda take that leap.

11338
08:21:30,060 --> 08:21:30,893
But that would be awesome.

11339
08:21:30,893 --> 08:21:34,139
- And then like going from
letters to words is another step.

11340
08:21:34,139 --> 08:21:35,729
Like you would go from,

11341
08:21:35,729 --> 08:21:36,709
right now, it's finger spelling

11342
08:21:36,709 --> 08:21:38,849
of like just the sign language alphabet.

11343
08:21:38,849 --> 08:21:40,289
But if it's able to pick that up,

11344
08:21:40,290 --> 08:21:41,850
then it should be able to pick up

11345
08:21:41,849 --> 08:21:44,879
like the whole sign
language like language.

11346
08:21:44,880 --> 08:21:48,389
And so then if I could do
something along those lines,

11347
08:21:48,389 --> 08:21:51,720
or just the sign language spelled word,

11348
08:21:51,720 --> 08:21:55,080
if I can spell it at a reasonable speed

11349
08:21:55,080 --> 08:21:56,520
and it can pick that up,

11350
08:21:56,520 --> 08:21:59,670
then I would just be able
to think that through

11351
08:21:59,669 --> 08:22:01,229
and it would do the same thing.

11352
08:22:01,229 --> 08:22:02,759
I don't see why not.

11353
08:22:02,759 --> 08:22:07,079
After what I saw with the cursor control,

11354
08:22:07,080 --> 08:22:08,700
I don't see why it wouldn't work,

11355
08:22:08,700 --> 08:22:10,319
but we'd have to play around with it more.

11356
08:22:10,319 --> 08:22:12,959
- What was the process in
terms of like training yourself

11357
08:22:12,959 --> 08:22:15,509
to go from attempted movement
to imagined movement?

11358
08:22:15,509 --> 08:22:17,090
How long did that take?

11359
08:22:17,090 --> 08:22:18,930
So how long would this
kind of process take?

11360
08:22:18,930 --> 08:22:20,610
- Well, it was a couple weeks

11361
08:22:20,610 --> 08:22:22,950
before it just like happened upon me.

11362
08:22:22,950 --> 08:22:25,920
But now that I know
that that was possible,

11363
08:22:25,919 --> 08:22:28,622
I think I could make it
happen with other things.

11364
08:22:29,520 --> 08:22:32,010
I think it would be much, much simpler.

11365
08:22:32,009 --> 08:22:34,409
- Would you get an
upgraded implant device?

11366
08:22:34,409 --> 08:22:35,883
- Sure, absolutely.

11367
08:22:36,720 --> 08:22:37,920
Whenever they'll let me.

11368
08:22:39,090 --> 08:22:40,349
- So you don't have any concerns

11369
08:22:40,349 --> 08:22:41,759
for you with the surgery experience?

11370
08:22:41,759 --> 08:22:45,629
All of it was like no regrets?

11371
08:22:45,630 --> 08:22:46,462
- No.

11372
08:22:46,462 --> 08:22:47,759
- So everything's been good so far?

11373
08:22:47,759 --> 08:22:49,234
- Yep.

11374
08:22:49,235 --> 08:22:50,610
- You just keep getting upgrades.

11375
08:22:50,610 --> 08:22:52,380
- Yeah, I mean, why not?

11376
08:22:52,380 --> 08:22:54,690
I've seen how much it's
impacted my life already.

11377
08:22:54,689 --> 08:22:57,106
And I know that everything
from here on out,

11378
08:22:57,106 --> 08:22:58,590
shit's gonna get better and better.

11379
08:22:58,590 --> 08:23:00,569
So I would love to.

11380
08:23:00,569 --> 08:23:02,130
I would love to get the upgrade.

11381
08:23:02,130 --> 08:23:06,750
- What future capabilities
are you excited about

11382
08:23:06,750 --> 08:23:09,843
sort of beyond this kind of telepathy?

11383
08:23:10,680 --> 08:23:11,970
Is vision interesting?

11384
08:23:11,970 --> 08:23:14,310
So for folks who, for
example, who are blind,

11385
08:23:14,310 --> 08:23:19,310
so you're like enabling
people to see, or for speech.

11386
08:23:19,500 --> 08:23:22,229
- Yeah, there's a lot that's
very, very cool about this.

11387
08:23:22,229 --> 08:23:23,399
I mean, we're talking about the brain,

11388
08:23:23,400 --> 08:23:26,100
so like this is just motor cortex stuff.

11389
08:23:26,099 --> 08:23:28,019
There's so much more that can be done.

11390
08:23:28,020 --> 08:23:30,959
The vision one is fascinating to me.

11391
08:23:30,959 --> 08:23:33,599
I think that is going
to be very, very cool.

11392
08:23:33,599 --> 08:23:34,949
To give someone the ability to see

11393
08:23:34,950 --> 08:23:38,490
for the first time in their
life would just be, I mean it,

11394
08:23:38,490 --> 08:23:41,430
it might be more amazing than
even helping someone like me.

11395
08:23:41,430 --> 08:23:43,950
Like that just sounds incredible.

11396
08:23:43,950 --> 08:23:46,229
The speech thing is really interesting,

11397
08:23:46,229 --> 08:23:49,829
being able to have some sort
of like real time translation

11398
08:23:49,830 --> 08:23:54,240
and cut away that language
barrier would be really cool.

11399
08:23:54,240 --> 08:23:58,470
Any sort of like actual
impairments that it could solve,

11400
08:23:58,470 --> 08:24:00,810
like with speech, would
be very, very cool.

11401
08:24:00,810 --> 08:24:03,750
And then also, there are a
lot of different disabilities

11402
08:24:03,750 --> 08:24:06,599
that all originate in the brain.

11403
08:24:06,599 --> 08:24:08,340
And you would be able to,

11404
08:24:08,340 --> 08:24:10,622
hopefully be able to solve a lot of those.

11405
08:24:11,520 --> 08:24:14,369
I know there's already stuff
to help people with seizures

11406
08:24:15,569 --> 08:24:17,340
that can be implanted in the brain.

11407
08:24:17,340 --> 08:24:20,549
This would do, I imagine, the same thing.

11408
08:24:20,549 --> 08:24:22,409
And so you could do something like that.

11409
08:24:22,409 --> 08:24:26,759
I know that even someone like
Joe Rogan has talked about

11410
08:24:26,759 --> 08:24:30,399
the possibilities with being able to

11411
08:24:31,409 --> 08:24:34,023
stimulate the brain in different ways.

11412
08:24:35,159 --> 08:24:36,393
I'm not sure.

11413
08:24:37,409 --> 08:24:41,790
I'm not sure how ethical
a lot of that would be.

11414
08:24:41,790 --> 08:24:44,819
That's beyond me honestly.

11415
08:24:44,819 --> 08:24:47,130
But I know that there's
a lot that can be done

11416
08:24:47,130 --> 08:24:48,690
when we're talking about the brain

11417
08:24:48,689 --> 08:24:51,840
and being able to go in and physically

11418
08:24:51,840 --> 08:24:55,590
make changes to help people
or to improve their lives.

11419
08:24:55,590 --> 08:24:56,790
So I'm really looking forward

11420
08:24:56,790 --> 08:24:58,470
to everything that comes from this.

11421
08:24:58,470 --> 08:25:00,633
And I don't think it's all that far off.

11422
08:25:01,889 --> 08:25:05,163
I think a lot of this can be
implemented within my lifetime,

11423
08:25:06,000 --> 08:25:07,619
assuming that I live a long life.

11424
08:25:07,619 --> 08:25:10,229
- What you were referring
to is things like

11425
08:25:10,229 --> 08:25:11,729
people suffering from depression

11426
08:25:11,729 --> 08:25:14,759
or things of that nature
potentially getting help.

11427
08:25:14,759 --> 08:25:18,989
- Yeah, flip a switch like
that, make someone happy.

11428
08:25:18,990 --> 08:25:21,180
I know, I think Joe has
talked about it more

11429
08:25:21,180 --> 08:25:24,569
in terms of like you want to experience

11430
08:25:24,569 --> 08:25:26,852
like what a drug trip feels like.

11431
08:25:26,852 --> 08:25:29,520
Like you wanna experience
what it'd be like to be on-

11432
08:25:29,520 --> 08:25:30,930
- Of course.
- Yeah, mushrooms

11433
08:25:30,930 --> 08:25:32,099
or something like that, DMT.

11434
08:25:32,099 --> 08:25:34,769
Like you can just flip
that switch in the brain.

11435
08:25:34,770 --> 08:25:38,459
My buddy Bain has talked about
being able to like wipe parts

11436
08:25:38,459 --> 08:25:41,399
of your memory and
re-experience things that,

11437
08:25:41,400 --> 08:25:42,233
like for the first time,

11438
08:25:42,233 --> 08:25:44,490
like your favorite movie
or your favorite book.

11439
08:25:44,490 --> 08:25:46,320
Like just wipe that out real quick,

11440
08:25:46,319 --> 08:25:49,619
and then re-fall in love with
Harry Potter or something.

11441
08:25:49,619 --> 08:25:50,909
I told him, I was like,

11442
08:25:50,909 --> 08:25:51,933
"I don't know how I feel about

11443
08:25:51,933 --> 08:25:55,290
like people being able to just
wipe parts of your memory.

11444
08:25:55,290 --> 08:25:56,400
That seems a little sketchy to me."

11445
08:25:56,400 --> 08:25:58,157
He's like, "They're already doing it."

11446
08:25:59,849 --> 08:26:00,842
- Sounds legit.

11447
08:26:01,889 --> 08:26:03,989
Yeah, I would love memory replay.

11448
08:26:03,990 --> 08:26:07,200
Just like actually high
resolution replay of old memories.

11449
08:26:07,200 --> 08:26:09,690
- Yeah, I saw an episode of
"Black Mirror" about that once.

11450
08:26:09,689 --> 08:26:11,099
I don't think I want it.

11451
08:26:11,099 --> 08:26:13,529
- Yeah, so "Black Mirror"
always kind of considers

11452
08:26:13,529 --> 08:26:15,449
the worst case, which is important.

11453
08:26:15,450 --> 08:26:18,229
I think people don't
consider the best case

11454
08:26:18,229 --> 08:26:19,860
or the average case enough.

11455
08:26:19,860 --> 08:26:21,720
I don't know what it is about us humans.

11456
08:26:21,720 --> 08:26:24,780
We wanna think about the
worst possible thing.

11457
08:26:24,779 --> 08:26:25,829
We love drama.

11458
08:26:25,830 --> 08:26:26,663
- [Noland] Yeah. (laughs)

11459
08:26:26,663 --> 08:26:30,119
- It's like, how's this new
technology gonna kill everybody?

11460
08:26:30,119 --> 08:26:31,309
We just love that.

11461
08:26:31,310 --> 08:26:32,520
Again like, yes, let's watch.

11462
08:26:32,520 --> 08:26:34,470
- Hopefully, people don't think
about that too much with me.

11463
08:26:34,470 --> 08:26:36,427
It'll ruin a lot of my plans.

11464
08:26:36,427 --> 08:26:37,470
- Yeah, yeah.

11465
08:26:37,470 --> 08:26:40,103
I assume you're gonna have
to take over the world.

11466
08:26:40,102 --> 08:26:42,270
I mean, I loved your Twitter.

11467
08:26:42,270 --> 08:26:44,010
You tweeted, "I'd like to make jokes

11468
08:26:44,009 --> 08:26:45,449
about hearing voices in my head

11469
08:26:45,450 --> 08:26:46,500
since getting the Neuralink,

11470
08:26:46,500 --> 08:26:48,779
but I feel like people
would take it the wrong way.

11471
08:26:48,779 --> 08:26:50,829
Plus, the voices in my
head told me not to."

11472
08:26:50,830 --> 08:26:52,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11473
08:26:52,139 --> 08:26:54,242
- Yeah.
- Please never stop.

11474
08:26:55,409 --> 08:26:57,009
So you're talking about Optimus.

11475
08:26:59,400 --> 08:27:02,250
Is that something you would
love to be able to do,

11476
08:27:02,250 --> 08:27:05,490
to control the robotic arm
or the entirety of Optimus?

11477
08:27:05,490 --> 08:27:06,780
- Oh yeah, for sure.

11478
08:27:06,779 --> 08:27:07,860
For sure, absolutely.

11479
08:27:07,860 --> 08:27:09,340
- You think there's something
like fundamentally different

11480
08:27:09,340 --> 08:27:12,330
about just being able to
physically interact with the world?

11481
08:27:12,330 --> 08:27:14,183
- Yeah, oh, 100%.

11482
08:27:17,159 --> 08:27:19,950
I know another thing with like being able

11483
08:27:19,950 --> 08:27:23,970
to like give people the
ability to like feel sensation

11484
08:27:23,970 --> 08:27:25,830
and stuff too by going in with the brain

11485
08:27:25,830 --> 08:27:27,930
and having the Neuralink maybe do that.

11486
08:27:27,930 --> 08:27:32,369
That could be something that
could be translated through,

11487
08:27:32,369 --> 08:27:34,319
transferred through the Optimus as well.

11488
08:27:34,319 --> 08:27:37,409
Like there's all sorts of really cool

11489
08:27:37,409 --> 08:27:38,369
interplay between that.

11490
08:27:38,369 --> 08:27:41,340
And then also, like you said,
just physically interacting.

11491
08:27:41,340 --> 08:27:45,029
I mean, 99% of the things

11492
08:27:45,029 --> 08:27:48,779
that I can't do myself obviously need,

11493
08:27:48,779 --> 08:27:50,639
I need a caretaker for,

11494
08:27:50,639 --> 08:27:52,409
someone to physically do things for me.

11495
08:27:52,409 --> 08:27:56,610
If an Optimus robot could
do that, like I could live

11496
08:27:56,610 --> 08:27:58,586
an incredibly independent life

11497
08:27:58,586 --> 08:28:01,149
and not be such a burden
on those around me

11498
08:28:02,819 --> 08:28:07,819
and it would change the
way people like me live,

11499
08:28:08,610 --> 08:28:11,133
at least until whatever
this is gets cured.

11500
08:28:12,180 --> 08:28:14,459
But being able to interact
with the world physically,

11501
08:28:14,459 --> 08:28:16,059
like that would just be amazing.

11502
08:28:18,029 --> 08:28:21,419
And they're not just like for being,

11503
08:28:21,419 --> 08:28:23,159
for having to be a caretaker or something,

11504
08:28:23,159 --> 08:28:25,349
but something like I talked about,

11505
08:28:25,349 --> 08:28:27,180
just being able to read a book.

11506
08:28:27,180 --> 08:28:28,349
Imagine an Optimus robot

11507
08:28:28,349 --> 08:28:30,629
just being able to hold a
book open in front of me,

11508
08:28:30,630 --> 08:28:32,130
like get that smell again.

11509
08:28:32,130 --> 08:28:35,159
I might not be able to
feel it at that point.

11510
08:28:35,159 --> 08:28:37,650
Or maybe I could again with
the sensation and stuff.

11511
08:28:37,650 --> 08:28:40,350
But there's something
different about reading

11512
08:28:40,349 --> 08:28:42,809
like a physical book
than staring at a screen

11513
08:28:42,810 --> 08:28:44,100
or listening to an audio book.

11514
08:28:44,099 --> 08:28:45,959
I actually don't like audio books.

11515
08:28:45,959 --> 08:28:47,939
I've listened to a ton
of them at this point,

11516
08:28:47,939 --> 08:28:49,739
but I don't really like 'em.

11517
08:28:49,740 --> 08:28:51,990
I would much rather like
read a physical copy.

11518
08:28:51,990 --> 08:28:53,460
- So one of the things you would love

11519
08:28:53,459 --> 08:28:57,059
to be able to experience
is opening the book,

11520
08:28:57,060 --> 08:28:59,973
bringing it up to you.

11521
08:28:59,973 --> 08:29:01,730
And to feel the touch of the paper.

11522
08:29:01,729 --> 08:29:02,562
- Yeah.

11523
08:29:02,562 --> 08:29:05,069
Oh man, the touch, the smell.

11524
08:29:05,069 --> 08:29:07,020
I mean, it's just like something

11525
08:29:07,020 --> 08:29:08,490
about the words on the page,

11526
08:29:08,490 --> 08:29:12,330
and they've replicated that page color

11527
08:29:12,330 --> 08:29:13,980
on like the Kindle and stuff.

11528
08:29:13,979 --> 08:29:16,380
Yeah, it's just not the same, yeah.

11529
08:29:16,380 --> 08:29:18,530
So just something as simple as that.

11530
08:29:18,529 --> 08:29:20,849
- So one of the things you miss is touch.

11531
08:29:20,849 --> 08:29:22,437
- I do, yeah.

11532
08:29:22,437 --> 08:29:25,619
- A lot of things that I
interact with in the world,

11533
08:29:25,619 --> 08:29:29,250
like clothes or literally
any physical thing

11534
08:29:29,250 --> 08:29:31,709
that I interact with in
the world, a lot of times,

11535
08:29:31,709 --> 08:29:34,200
what people around me will
do is they'll just come like,

11536
08:29:34,200 --> 08:29:35,790
rub it on my face.

11537
08:29:35,790 --> 08:29:38,490
They'll like lay something on
me so I can feel the weight.

11538
08:29:38,490 --> 08:29:42,720
They will rub a shirt on
me so I can feel fabric.

11539
08:29:42,720 --> 08:29:46,620
Like there's something
very profound about touch,

11540
08:29:46,619 --> 08:29:50,762
and it's something that I miss a lot,

11541
08:29:52,259 --> 08:29:56,879
and something I would love
to do again, but we'll see.

11542
08:29:56,880 --> 08:29:57,903
- What would be the first thing you do

11543
08:29:57,902 --> 08:30:00,750
with a hand that can touch?

11544
08:30:00,750 --> 08:30:02,279
Give your mom a hug after that, right?

11545
08:30:02,279 --> 08:30:04,079
- Yeah, I know.

11546
08:30:04,080 --> 08:30:08,430
It's one thing that I've asked like God

11547
08:30:08,430 --> 08:30:11,670
for basically every day since my accident

11548
08:30:11,669 --> 08:30:15,509
was just being able to like one day move,

11549
08:30:15,509 --> 08:30:17,459
even if it was only like my hand.

11550
08:30:17,459 --> 08:30:20,069
So that way, like I could
squeeze my mom's hand

11551
08:30:20,069 --> 08:30:22,500
or something just to like show her that,

11552
08:30:22,500 --> 08:30:25,830
like how much I care and how
much I love her and everything.

11553
08:30:25,830 --> 08:30:27,900
Something along those lines.

11554
08:30:27,900 --> 08:30:31,110
Being able to just interact
with the people around me,

11555
08:30:31,110 --> 08:30:33,093
handshake, give someone a hug.

11556
08:30:34,409 --> 08:30:36,360
I don't know, anything like that.

11557
08:30:36,360 --> 08:30:40,743
Being able to help me eat, like
I'd probably get really fat,

11558
08:30:41,790 --> 08:30:44,610
which would be a terrible, terrible thing.

11559
08:30:44,610 --> 08:30:47,729
- Also beat Bliss in chess
on a physical chess board.

11560
08:30:47,729 --> 08:30:48,720
- Yeah, yeah.

11561
08:30:48,720 --> 08:30:52,770
I mean, there are just
so many upsides. (laughs)

11562
08:30:52,770 --> 08:30:56,250
And any way to find some way to feel

11563
08:30:56,250 --> 08:30:58,529
like I'm bringing Bliss down to my level.

11564
08:30:58,529 --> 08:30:59,549
- Yeah.
- Because-

11565
08:30:59,549 --> 08:31:01,349
- Yeah.
- He's just such

11566
08:31:01,349 --> 08:31:03,059
an amazing guy, and everything about him

11567
08:31:03,060 --> 08:31:07,950
is just so above and beyond
that anything I can do

11568
08:31:07,950 --> 08:31:10,500
to take him down a notch,
I'm more than happy.

11569
08:31:10,500 --> 08:31:12,840
- Yeah, humble him a bit, he needs it.

11570
08:31:12,840 --> 08:31:13,672
- [Noland] Yeah. (laughs)

11571
08:31:13,672 --> 08:31:14,579
- Okay.

11572
08:31:14,580 --> 08:31:15,933
As he's sitting next to me.

11573
08:31:17,369 --> 08:31:20,069
Did you ever make sense of why God

11574
08:31:20,069 --> 08:31:22,382
puts good people through such hardship?

11575
08:31:23,669 --> 08:31:24,992
- Oh, man.

11576
08:31:29,189 --> 08:31:34,020
I think it's all about understanding

11577
08:31:34,020 --> 08:31:36,150
how much we need God.

11578
08:31:36,150 --> 08:31:41,150
And I don't think that there's
any light without the dark.

11579
08:31:41,459 --> 08:31:44,433
I think that if all of us
were happy all the time,

11580
08:31:45,299 --> 08:31:50,299
there would be no reason
to turn to God ever.

11581
08:31:50,819 --> 08:31:55,709
I feel like there would be
no concept of good or bad.

11582
08:31:55,709 --> 08:32:00,709
And I think that as much
of like the darkness

11583
08:32:00,990 --> 08:32:05,940
and the evil that's in the
world, it makes us all appreciate

11584
08:32:05,939 --> 08:32:08,279
the good and the things
we have so much more.

11585
08:32:08,279 --> 08:32:12,389
And I think, like when I had my accident,

11586
08:32:12,389 --> 08:32:13,979
one of the first things I said to one

11587
08:32:13,979 --> 08:32:16,739
of my best friends was,
and this was within like

11588
08:32:16,740 --> 08:32:19,117
the first month or two
after my accident, I said,

11589
08:32:19,116 --> 08:32:21,516
"Everything about this
accident has just made me

11590
08:32:22,590 --> 08:32:25,830
understand and believe
that like God is real

11591
08:32:25,830 --> 08:32:27,600
and that there really is a God, basically.

11592
08:32:27,599 --> 08:32:30,359
And that like my interactions with him

11593
08:32:30,360 --> 08:32:32,970
have all been real and worthwhile."

11594
08:32:32,970 --> 08:32:34,680
And he said, if anything,

11595
08:32:34,680 --> 08:32:36,299
seeing me go through this accident,

11596
08:32:36,299 --> 08:32:39,719
he believes that there isn't a God.

11597
08:32:39,720 --> 08:32:42,032
And it's a very different reaction.

11598
08:32:43,169 --> 08:32:47,309
But I believe that it is
a way for God to test us,

11599
08:32:47,310 --> 08:32:51,569
to build our character, to send us through

11600
08:32:51,569 --> 08:32:53,549
trials and tribulations,

11601
08:32:53,549 --> 08:32:58,549
to make sure that we
understand how precious he is,

11602
08:32:59,069 --> 08:33:00,116
and the things that he's given us

11603
08:33:00,116 --> 08:33:01,769
and the time that he's given us.

11604
08:33:01,770 --> 08:33:06,090
And then to hopefully
grow from all of that.

11605
08:33:06,090 --> 08:33:07,860
I think that's a huge part of being here

11606
08:33:07,860 --> 08:33:12,549
is to not just have an easy life

11607
08:33:14,669 --> 08:33:16,349
and do everything that's easy,

11608
08:33:16,349 --> 08:33:18,000
but to step out of our comfort zones

11609
08:33:18,000 --> 08:33:19,830
and really challenge ourselves,

11610
08:33:19,830 --> 08:33:21,990
because I think that's how we grow.

11611
08:33:21,990 --> 08:33:24,180
- What gives you hope
about this whole thing

11612
08:33:24,180 --> 08:33:26,894
we have going on, human civilization?

11613
08:33:26,894 --> 08:33:28,082
- Oh, man.

11614
08:33:29,849 --> 08:33:34,712
I think people are my biggest inspiration.

11615
08:33:35,549 --> 08:33:39,569
Even just being at
Neuralink for a few months,

11616
08:33:39,569 --> 08:33:42,689
looking people in the eyes
and hearing their motivations

11617
08:33:42,689 --> 08:33:47,459
for why they're doing
this, it's so inspiring.

11618
08:33:47,459 --> 08:33:50,579
And I know that they
could be other places,

11619
08:33:50,580 --> 08:33:54,330
cushier jobs, working somewhere else,

11620
08:33:54,330 --> 08:33:58,770
doing X, Y, or Z that doesn't
really mean that much.

11621
08:33:58,770 --> 08:34:03,750
But instead they're here, and
they want to better humanity

11622
08:34:03,750 --> 08:34:06,779
and they want a better,
just the people around them,

11623
08:34:06,779 --> 08:34:08,849
the people that they've
interacted with in their life,

11624
08:34:08,849 --> 08:34:11,909
they wanna make better lives
for their own family members

11625
08:34:11,909 --> 08:34:14,579
who might have disabilities,
or they look at someone like me

11626
08:34:14,580 --> 08:34:16,830
and they say, "I can
do something about that

11627
08:34:16,830 --> 08:34:18,030
so I'm going to."

11628
08:34:18,029 --> 08:34:20,219
And it's always been what I've connected

11629
08:34:20,220 --> 08:34:22,830
with most in the world are people.

11630
08:34:22,830 --> 08:34:24,210
I've always been a people person

11631
08:34:24,209 --> 08:34:25,919
and I love learning about people,

11632
08:34:25,919 --> 08:34:29,159
and I love learning like
how people developed

11633
08:34:29,159 --> 08:34:30,630
and where they came from.

11634
08:34:30,630 --> 08:34:33,930
And to see like how much
people are willing to do

11635
08:34:33,930 --> 08:34:36,360
for someone like me
when they don't have to,

11636
08:34:36,360 --> 08:34:39,900
and they're going out of their
way to make my life better.

11637
08:34:39,900 --> 08:34:42,659
It gives me a lot of hope
for just humanity in general,

11638
08:34:42,659 --> 08:34:46,409
how much we care and how
much we're capable of

11639
08:34:46,409 --> 08:34:49,020
when we all kind of get together

11640
08:34:49,020 --> 08:34:50,580
and try to make a difference.

11641
08:34:50,580 --> 08:34:54,450
And I know there's a lot of
bad out there in the world,

11642
08:34:54,450 --> 08:34:57,000
but there always has been
and there always will be.

11643
08:34:58,229 --> 08:35:01,409
And I think that that is,

11644
08:35:01,409 --> 08:35:04,650
it shows human resiliency and it shows

11645
08:35:04,650 --> 08:35:07,890
what we're able to endure,

11646
08:35:07,889 --> 08:35:12,889
and how much we just want to
be there and help each other,

11647
08:35:16,110 --> 08:35:18,420
and how much satisfaction
we get from that,

11648
08:35:18,419 --> 08:35:20,159
because I think that's one of the reasons

11649
08:35:20,159 --> 08:35:22,020
that we're here is just
to help each other.

11650
08:35:22,020 --> 08:35:27,020
And I don't know, that
always gives me hope.

11651
08:35:27,119 --> 08:35:29,279
It's just realizing that
there are people out there

11652
08:35:29,279 --> 08:35:30,979
who still care and who wanna help.

11653
08:35:31,950 --> 08:35:34,290
- And thank you for being
one such human being

11654
08:35:34,290 --> 08:35:36,389
and continuing to be a great human being

11655
08:35:36,389 --> 08:35:39,029
through everything you've been through

11656
08:35:39,029 --> 08:35:41,189
and being an inspiration to many people,

11657
08:35:41,189 --> 08:35:44,969
to myself, for many reasons,
including your epic,

11658
08:35:44,970 --> 08:35:48,032
unbelievably great performance on Webgrid.

11659
08:35:48,032 --> 08:35:52,139
I'll be training all night
tonight to try to catch up.

11660
08:35:52,139 --> 08:35:52,972
- You can do it.

11661
08:35:52,973 --> 08:35:53,850
- And I believe in you,

11662
08:35:53,849 --> 08:35:55,829
that you can once you come back,

11663
08:35:55,830 --> 08:35:57,690
so sorry to interrupt
with the Austin trip,

11664
08:35:57,689 --> 08:36:00,599
once you come back, eventually beat Bliss.

11665
08:36:00,599 --> 08:36:02,340
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

11666
08:36:02,340 --> 08:36:03,740
Absolutely.
- I'm rooting for you.

11667
08:36:03,740 --> 08:36:05,520
The whole world is rooting for you.

11668
08:36:05,520 --> 08:36:06,352
- Thank you.
- Thank you

11669
08:36:06,352 --> 08:36:07,185
for everything you've done, man.

11670
08:36:07,186 --> 08:36:08,163
- Thanks, thanks man.

11671
08:36:09,060 --> 08:36:11,130
- Thanks for listening
to this conversation

11672
08:36:11,130 --> 08:36:14,310
with Nolan Arbaugh, and
before that, with Elon Musk,

11673
08:36:14,310 --> 08:36:17,819
DJ Seo, Matthew MacDougall,
and Bliss Chapman.

11674
08:36:17,819 --> 08:36:19,590
To support this podcast, please check out

11675
08:36:19,590 --> 08:36:21,900
our sponsors in the description.

11676
08:36:21,900 --> 08:36:25,770
And now, let me leave you with
some words from Aldous Huxley

11677
08:36:25,770 --> 08:36:28,296
in "The Doors of Perception."

11678
08:36:28,296 --> 08:36:30,149
"We live together.

11679
08:36:30,150 --> 08:36:32,970
We act on and react to one another,

11680
08:36:32,970 --> 08:36:37,970
but always, and in all
circumstances, we are by ourselves.

11681
08:36:38,580 --> 08:36:41,340
The martyrs go hand in
hand into the arena.

11682
08:36:41,340 --> 08:36:43,740
They are crucified alone.

11683
08:36:43,740 --> 08:36:46,140
Embraced, the lovers
desperately try to fuse

11684
08:36:46,139 --> 08:36:48,029
their insulated ecstasies

11685
08:36:48,029 --> 08:36:51,753
into a single self-transcendence; in vain.

11686
08:36:52,650 --> 08:36:55,380
By its very nature, every embodied spirit

11687
08:36:55,380 --> 08:36:58,710
is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude.

11688
08:36:58,709 --> 08:37:01,020
Sensations, feelings, insights, fancies,

11689
08:37:01,020 --> 08:37:04,979
all these are private and,
except through symbols

11690
08:37:04,979 --> 08:37:08,057
and at second hand, incommunicable.

11691
08:37:09,240 --> 08:37:11,700
We can pool information about experiences,

11692
08:37:11,700 --> 08:37:14,400
but never the experiences themselves.

11693
08:37:14,400 --> 08:37:17,550
From family to nation, every human group

11694
08:37:17,549 --> 08:37:20,882
is a society of island universes.

11695
08:37:21,990 --> 08:37:23,280
Thank you for listening,

11696
08:37:23,279 --> 08:37:25,832
and hope to see you next time.
