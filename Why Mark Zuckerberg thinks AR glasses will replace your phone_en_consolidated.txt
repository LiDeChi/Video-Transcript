    [Music] Mark we just tried Orion together yeah we're fresh off of it it feels like true AR glasses are finally getting closer Orion is a product that you all have been working on for five plus years yeah almost 10 almost 10 yeah so take me back to the beginning when you started the project when it started in research like what were you thinking about what was the goal for it well I I think a lot of it goes all the way back to our relationship with mobile platforms and all that right so it's um you know we have lived through one major platform transition already because we started on web right not not on mobile and mobile phones and smartphones kind of got started around the same time as Facebook and and kind of early social media was getting started so didn't really get to play any role in that platform transition but going through it right we weren't born on mobile we kind of had this awareness that okay web was a thing mobile is a thing it is different um there are strengths and weaknesses of it there's this Continuum of computing where now you have a a mobile device that you can take with you all the time and that's amazing MH but it's small kind of pulls you away from other interactions those things are not great but there was sort of this recognition that just like there's the transition from computers to mobile um mobile is not going to be the end of the line so as soon as we started becoming like a more I I guess I'd say Stable Company like once we found our footing on mobile and and we weren't like clearly going to go out of business or something like that I was like okay let's start um planting our our some seeds for what we think could be the future right it's like mobile is already kind of getting defined um you know by 2012 2014 is it was generally too late to to Really shape that platform in a meaningful way I we we had some experiments I didn't succeed or go anywhere so pretty quickly I was like okay we should focus on the future because just like there's the shift from from from desktop to Mobile new things are going to be possible in the future so what is that um I think the kind of simplest version of it is basically what you started seeing with Orion right it's it's like the vision is a normal pair of glasses that can do two really fundamental things one is put Holograms in the world to deliver this realistic sense of presence like you there with another person or in another place or maybe you're physically with a person but just like we did you can pull up a virtual pong game or you know whatever um you can work on things together you can sit at a coffee shop pull up your whole uh workstation of different monitors you know you can be on a flight or in the backseat of a car and pull up a full screen movie theater and and like okay all these things like great Computing full sense of presence like you're there with people no matter where they are thing two is it's the ideal device for AI and the reason for that is because glasses are sort of uniquely positioned for you to be able to let them see what you see and hear what you hear and give you very subtle feedback back to you where they can speak in your ear or um or they can have silent input that that kind of shows up on the on the glasses that that other people can't see and doesn't take you away from the world around you and I think that that is all going to be really profound now when we got started with this I had thought that kind of the Hologram part of this was going to be possible before AI um so it's sort of an interesting Twist of faith that the AI part is actually possible before um before the Holograms are really able to be mass-produced at a at kind of an affordable price but um but that was sort of the vision I think that it's pretty easy to wrap your head around and there's already you know billion to two billion people who wear glasses on a daily basis just like you know everyone who didn't have smartphones were kind of the first people to upgrade two smartphones I think everyone who has glasses is pretty quickly going to upgrade to smart glasses over the next decade and then I think it's going to start being really valuable and you know a lot of other people who aren't wearing glasses today are going to end up wearing them too um that's kind of the simple version and then I think as we've developed this out there are all these sort of more Nu directions that have emerged too so we've started you know while while that was kind of the full version of what we wanted to build there are all these things that we said okay well well maybe it's it's really hard to build normal looking glasses that can do Holograms um at an affordable price point so what parts of that can we take on and that's where we did the partnership with slor luoda so it's like okay before you have a display you can get normal looking glasses that can have a camera they can have a microphone great audio can capture content can um um and you can stream video at this point but the most important feature at this point is the ability to access meta Ai and just kind of have kind of a full AI there multimodal because it has has camera um and I mean that product is starting at $300 and you know initially I kind of thought hey this is sort of on the technology path to building full holographic glasses at this point I actually just think both are going to exist longterm right I think that there are going to be people who want the full holographic glasses and I think that there are going to be people who prefer kind of the superior form factor or lower price of a device where they are primarily optimizing for getting AI um I also think there's going to be a range of things in between right so there's the full kind of field of view that we that you just saw right 70° really wide field of view for glasses um but I think that there are other products in between that too there's like a heads up display version which um you know for that you probably just need you know 20 30° you can't do kind of the full kind of world Holograms where you're interacting with things like you're not going to play ping pong in in 30 Dee field of view um but you can communicate with AI um you can text your friends you can get directions um you can see the content that you're capturing um so I there's a lot there that's going to be compelling and at each step along this Continuum from display list to small display to kind of full holographic you're packing more technology in so each step up is going to be a little more expensive um is going to have a little more constraints on the form factor even though I think we'll get them all to be attractive you'll be able to do the the kind of simpler ones and much smaller form factors permanently um and then of course there's the mixed reality headsets which kind of took a different direction which is going towards the same vision but on that we said okay well we're not going to try to fit into a glasses form factor for that one we're going to say okay we're going to really go for all the compute that we want and we're going to say okay this is going to be more of like a heads goggles form factor and my guess is that that's going to be a thing long term too because there are a bunch of uses where people want the full immersion um and you know if you're sitting at your desk and working for a long period of time you might want the more computing power than you're going to be able to get but but I I I think that there's no doubt that kind of what you saw with Orion is the I think kind of quintessential vision of what people what at least kind of I thought and and continue to think is going to be the next multi billion person major Computing platform and then kind of all these other things are going to get built out around it it's my understanding that you originally hoped Orion would be a consumer product when you first set out to build it yeah yeah Orion was meant to be our first consumer product and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to pull it off I mean in general it's probably turned out significantly better than our kind of 50/50 estimates of what it would be but we didn't get there on everything that we wanted to I think we we still wanted to be a little smaller um a little brighter like a little bit higher resolution um and a lot more affordable before we kind of put it out there as a product and and look we have line of sight to all those things so I think um so so I I think we'll we'll probably have the thing that was going to be the V2 end up being the consumer product and we're going to use Orion with developers to basically cultivate the software experience that way by the time we're ready to ship something it's going to be much more dialed in but to be clear you're not selling Orion at all I guess what I'm wondering is when you made the call I think it was around 2022 to say oryan is going to just be internal kind of dev kit um how did you feel about making that call was there any part of you that was like man I really wish this could have just been the consumer product we had built I me I always want to ship stuff quickly and and all that um but I think it was the right thing I mean I think on this product I think that there is a there's a pretty clear set of constraints that I think you want to hit MH um especially around the form Factor right I mean it it is very helpful for us that sort of chunkier glasses are kind of ascendant in the fashion world because that allows us to build glasses that are going to be fashionable but also Tech forward but um even so I'd say you know these are unmistakably glasses they're reasonably comfortable they're you know under 100 gram I them for two hours and I couldn't really tell yeah but but I mean I think we aspire to building things that like look really good right and and I think this is like good glasses but I I I wanted it to be a little a little smaller so it can fit within like really fashionable right when people see the ray bands there's no compromise on fashion it's like like part of why I think people like them is yeah you get all this functionality but even when you're not using it they're great glasses and I I think for the future version of Orion that's the Target too we want to make it so that um you know most of the time you're going through your day you're not Computing right and or it's or something is happening in the background or something but um so it just needs to be good in order for you to kind of want to keep it on your face and I I feel like we're almost there I think we made we've made more progress than anyone else in the world that I'm aware of um but it didn't quite hit my bar um and similarly on price um these are going to be more expensive than the ray bands right I mean there's just a lot more Tech that's going in them but you know we do want to have it be within a consumer price point and um this was this was outside that race so I wanted to wait until we could get to that range in order to to have something that we sh are you imagining that the first commercial version whenever it is in the next couple few years will it be a developer focused product that you're selling publicly you want it to be a consumer ready and that's why I'm asking about the strategy because Apple snap others have decided to do developer Focus plays and get the hardware kind of going with developers early but you're kind of are you saying you're skipping that and you just want cons we are using this as a developer kit just primarily inter and maybe with a handful of Partners but I mean I think at this point meta is by far the kind of Premier developer of augmented reality and virtual and mixed reality software and Hardware in the world so you can think about it as a developer kit but we just have a lot of that talent inous and then we also have well-developed Partnerships with a lot of folks externally who we can go to and work with them as well so it's um I don't think we need to go announce a dev kit that like that kind of arbitrary developers can go buy to get access to the talent that we need to go build out the platform I think we're kind of in a place where we can work with partners and and do that but that's absolutely what we're going to do over the next few years we're going to hone the experience and figure out what we need to do to to to Really nail it when it's ready to ship a lot has been written about how much you're spending on reality labs and if you I don't you probably can't have an exact number but if you were to guesstimate the cost of just building Orion over the last 10 years are we talking five plus billion more than that um yeah probably probably yeah yeah but I mean overall um for reality labs for a while a lot of people thought of all of that budget is going towards virtual and mixed reality and I actually think we've said publicly that our glasses programs are are a bigger budget than our virtual and mixed reality programs um but that goes across all of them right so that's the kind of full AR that's um the displaylist glasses like all the work we're going to do on on um on rayan and we just announced the expanded partnership with luoda luoda great company we've had a great experience working with them they designed so many great glasses and I think you know working with them to to do even more um is is is going to be really exciting so there there's a lot more to do there on on all of these things how does this partnership work uh and this renew that you just did with them how is it structured what is this deal like you know I think it was more of just a kind of commitment from companies that we're feeling pretty good about how this is going and we're going to build a lot more glasses together and part of the way it works is um you know rather than having sort of doing one generation and then designing the Next Generation I think by having a longer term partnership it allows the teams to not just have to worry about one thing at a time then like okay is this one going to be good and then how do we build on that for the next one now we can start like a multi-year road map of many different devices knowing that we're going to be working together for a long time so I'm optimistic about that that's sort of how we work internally right we don't just I mean sometimes when you're early on you you definitely want to learn from each device launch but um when there are things that you're committed to I don't think you want the team to feel like okay if we don't get the short-term Milestone then like we're going to cancel the whole thing right um so are you buying mistake in elsur lexotica um yeah I think we've talked about investing in them it's it's not going to be a a kind of major thing I'd say it's more of a of a symbolic um thing I me we we we want to have this to be a long-term partnership and um as as part of that um I thought that this would be kind of a nice gesture and I fundamentally believe in them a lot I mean I think that they're going to go from being a the premier glasses company in the world to I think one of the major technology companies in the world I me my vision for for them and how I think about it is that if you think about like how Samsung in in Korea kind of um made it so that Samsung that Korea became one of the main hubs of building phones in the world I mean I think that this is probably kind of one of the best shots for Europe and Italy in particular to become a major hub for manufacturing and building and designing the next major category of of smart glasses and sorry of computing platforms overall so um and and I think that they're they're kind of all in on that now and and it's been this interesting question um because you know they have they have such a good business and such deep competence in in the areas and I I've gotten more of an appreciation of how strong of a technology they company they are in their own way right designing lenses designing the materials that you need to make um fashionable glasses that can be light enough but um but also kind of like feel good um they have they bring a huge amount that I think is um people in kind of our world the tech World probably don't necessarily see but but I think that they're really well set up for the future so I I I believe in the partnership I'm really excited about the work that we're doing together and fundamentally I think that that's just going to be a massively successful company in the future um is is it set up to where they control the designs or and you provide the tech stack or do you collaborate on the design like I I think we collaborate on on everything it's it's actually I mean part of working together is um you kind of build a joint culture over time and there were a lot of really sharp people over there who I think it took maybe a couple versions for us really to gain an appreciation for how we each of us approach things because um you know they really think about things from this like fashion manufacturing lens selling optical devices perspective um and we obviously come at it from uh kind of consumer electronics AI umof software perspective but I think over time we just kind of appreciate each other's perspectives on things a lot more and I mean I I'm like constantly talking to them about things to get their ideas on different things I mean but you know when Partnerships are working well when you reach out to them to get their opinion on things that are not actually currently in the scope of what you're working on together and and because I I do that frequently with um with Rocco who runs their wearables and Franchesco who's their their uh their CEO it's um and our team does that too with with like a large part of the working group over there it's um it's it's a good crew they're they they kind of they share good values they're they're really sharp and like I said I I believe in them a lot and I think it's going to be a very successful partnership and Company yeah how many Rayband metas have you sold so far I don't know if we've given a number on that but I know it's asking yeah it's um it's going very well uh you know one of the things I think is interesting is we we underestimated demand so part of you know one thing that is very different in the world of consumer electronics than software is um there are fewer kind of Supply constraints in software there are some I mean like some of the stuff that we're rolling out like voice on meta AI um we need to meter it as we're rolling it out because we need to make sure we have enough inference capacity to to handle it but fundamentally we'll resolve that um in weeks right but for manufacturing it's like you make these concrete decisions like okay are we setting up four manufacturing lines or six and you know each one it was a big upfront capex investment and you're basically deciding upfront the velocity at which you're going to be able to generate Supply before you know what the demand is so on this one we thought that Rayband meta was probably going to sell three or five times more than the first version did and we just dramatically underestimated what the so now we're in this position where it's actually been somewhat hard for us to gauge what the real demand is because they're sold out you can't get them so if you can't get them like then then how do you know where where the actual curve is but but that's um we're basically getting to the point where that's resolved now we we kind of adjusted we made the decision to build more more manufacturing lines they took some time to do it they're online now we're kind of you know it's it's not just about being able to make them you need to get them into all the stores and get the distribution right we feel like that's in a pretty good place now so I'd say over the rest of this year we're going to start getting a real sense of the demand but while that's going on the glasses keep getting better because of overthe a AI updates so the hardware doesn't necessarily change even though um we keep shipping new frames and new type of you know they're adding more Transitions lenses because people want to wear them indoors um and that's an interesting thing because I mean people sunglasses are a little more discretionary so I think a lot more people early on were thinking hey yeah I'll try I'll experiment with this with sunglasses I'm not going to make these my primary glasses um now we're seeing a lot more people say hey this actually really useful I want to be able to wear them inside I want them to be my primary glasses so whether that's kind of working with them through the optical Channel or the transitions that's an important part but the the AI part of this um is also it just keeps getting better I we talked about it at um at connect I mean basically the ability to now you over the next few months when we roll This Out real-time translations you're traveling abroad someone's speaking Spanish to you you just get it translated into English in your ear just roll out to more and more languages over time I think we're starting with a few we'll kind of hit more over time um I tried that well actually I didn't try real time but I tried looking at a menu in French and it translated into English and then I was like at the end I was like what is Euro and dollar actually and it did that too and then I'm also starting to see the Continuum of this to Orion in the sense of the utility aspects you could say look at this and remind me about it at 8:00 p.m. tonight and then it sinks with so I guess it's not replacing the phone but it's augmenting what I would do with my phone like how are these glasses going to be more deeply tied to Med AI over time um seems like they're getting closer and closer all the time but yeah well well I think Medi is becoming a more and more prominent feature of the glasses right there's more stuff that you can do so you just mentioned reminders as another example it's like now that is just going to work and now your glasses can remind you of things and so okay you can look at a phone number and say call this phone number and then it calls on the phone you know just will just add more capabilities over time and some of better are model updates right so like okay now it has llama 3.2 but um but some of it is is kind of software development around it like reminders you don't get for free just because we updated the model that's kind we have this big software development effort and um and and we're kind of adding features continuously and developing the ecosystem right so you get more apps so know Spotify and all these different things kind of kind of can work more natively so the glasses just more and more useful um which I think is also going to increase demand over time and how does it interact with phones I mean like you said I don't think people are getting rid of phones anytime soon um the way I kind of think about this is that when phones became the primary Computing platform we didn't get rid of computers we just kind of shifted right so I I I don't know if you have this experience but at some point in the early 2010s I noticed that I'd be sitting at my desk in front of my computer and I'd just pull out my phone to do things yeah and I think what's going to happen it's not like we're going to throw away our phones but I think slowly um we're just going to start doing more things with our glasses and leaving our phones in our pockets more and it's not like we're done with our computers and I don't think we're going to be done with our phones for a while but there's a pretty clear path where um where you're just going to use your glasses for more and more things and over time I the glasses are also going to be able to be powered by wrist-based wearables or other wearables so you're going to wake up one day 10 years AG from now and you're not even going to need to bring your phone with you now you're still going to have a phone but I I think like more of the time people are going to leave it in their pocket or leave it in their bag or eventually even some of the time leave it in their at home and um I think there will just be this sort of gradual shift to glasses becoming the main way that we do Computing it's interesting that we're talking about this right now because I feel like phones are becoming kind of boring and stale you know like I I just was like looking at the new iPhone and it's basically the same as the year before people are doing foldables but like it feels like people have kind of run out of ideas on phones and that they're kind of at their natural end State and I wonder you know when you see something like the rayb bands and how people have really gravitated to them in a way that's surprised you guys and I think surprised all of us but it's also just like people want to interact with technology in different ways now and I think AI like you said at the beginning like the way that AI is intersected with this is just kind of like a aha thing for people that honestly for me I didn't expect it to click as quickly as it did but like when I got WID listed for the AI I was like walking around my backyard and like using it and I was like oh like I it's obvious now where this is going so it feels like we're like I was saying at the beginning it feels like things are finally you can see where it's going whereas Before It's been a lot of like R&D and talking about it but like these the ray bands are kind of a signifier of that and I'm wondering if you agree with that I agree I mean I still think it's early um I think you really want to be able to not just ask the AI questions but ask it to do things yeah and know that it's going to reliably go do it and we're starting with simple things right so voice control of your glasses although you can do that on phones too things like ERS although you can generally do that on on phones too but I think as the model capabilities grow over the next couple of generations and you get more of you know what people call these agentic um capabilities I think it's it's going to start to get pretty exciting for what it's worth I I I also think that all the AI work is going to make phones a lot more exciting um it's the most exciting thing I think that has happened to our family of apps road map in a long time is all of the all the AI things that we're building so um you know if I were trying to design what you know the next few versions of iPhone or Google's phone should be I mean I I think that there's a long and interesting road map of things that they can go do with AI that um as an app developer we can't so um so I think that that's like a pretty exciting and and interesting thing for them to go do which I I assume that they will on the AI uh social media piece one of the Wilder things that your team told me you guys are going to start doing is showing people AI generated imagery personalized to them in feed I think it's starting as an experiment but like if you're a photographer you would see Meta AI generating content that's maybe personalized for you alongside content from the people you follow yeah and that's this idea that I've been thinking about of AI and kind of invading social media so to speak um maybe you don't like the word invading but you know what I mean and what does that what does that do to how we how we relate to each other as humans like how much AI stuff and AI Genera stuff is going to be filling feeds in the near future uh in your view well here's how I Comm at this so in the history of running the company where we've been building these apps for 20 years every call it 3 to five years there's some new major format that comes along that is typically additive to the experience right so you know initially people kind of updated their profiles then they were able to post statuses that were texts then then links um you got photos early on um then you added videos um then with mobile basically you know snap invented stories the first version of that and that became a a pretty kind of widely used format um the whole version of short form videos I think is is sort of a still ascendant format but you basically um at each step along the way you want to right it's like you keep on making the system richer by having more different types of content that people can um can share and and different ways to express themselves and when you look out for the next 10 years of okay if this trend seems to happen where every 3 five years whatever the pace is that there are new formats I think given the pace of change in the tech industry I think you'd bet that that continues or accelerates and I think you'd bet that probably most of the new formats are going to be kind of AI connected in some way given that that's the kind of driving theme for the industry at this point so given that kind of set of assumptions um we're sort of trying to understand what are the things that are most useful to people within that um there's one vein of this which is helping people and creators make better content using AI right so that's um that I think is going to be pretty clear right just make it like super easy for like aspiring creators or Advanced creators to make much better stuff than they would be able to otherwise um that can take the format of like all right like my daughter is writing a book and she wants it Illustrated and like we sit down together and work with meta Ai and imagine to help her come up with images to illustrate it um it's like okay that's like a thing that's like she didn't have the capability to do that before she's not a graphic designer but now she kind of has that that that that ability I think that that's going to be pretty cool um then I think that there's a version where you have just this great diversity of AI agents that are as part of the system and this I think is a big difference between our vision of AI and most of the other companies is yeah we're building meta AI as as kind of the main assistant that you can build that's sort of equivalent to you know the singular assistant that maybe like a Google or an open AI or different folks are building but it's not really the main thing that we're doing um you know our main vision is that we think that there are going to be a lot of these right it's every business all the hundreds of millions of small businesses um you know just like they have a website and an email address and a social media account today I think that they're all going to have an AI that helps them interact with their customers in the future that does some combination of sales and customer support and all that um I think all the creators are basically going to want some version of this that basically helps them interact with their Community when they're just limited by they don't have enough hours in the day to interact with all the messages that are coming in and um they want to make sure that they can show some love to to people in their in their Community um and those I think are just the two most obvious ones that even if we just did those that's many hundreds of millions but then there's going to be all this more creative stuff that's ugc that people create for that are kind of Wilder use cases that they want and our view is okay these are all going to like live across these social networks and Beyond and um I I don't think that they should just be constrained to waiting until someone messages them right I think that they're going to have their own profiles they're going to be creating content people will be able to follow them if they want um you'll be able to comment on their stuff um they may be able to comment on your stuff if you're connected with them I there will obviously be different different logic and rules but that that's one way that there's going to be just a lot more kind of AI participants in the kind of broader social construct that we have and then I think you get to the test that you mentioned which is maybe the most abstract which is just having kind of the central meta AI system directly generate content for you based on what we think is going to be interesting to you and putting that in your feed and on that you know I think that there's this been there's been this trend over time where the feeds started off as primarily and exclusively content from people you you followed friends um I guess it was friends early on then it kind of broadened out to okay you followed a set of friends and creators and then it got to a point where the algorithm was good enough where we're actually showing you a lot of stuff that you're not following directly because um in some ways that's a better way to show you more interesting stuff than only constraining it to things that you've chosen to follow and I think the next logical jump on that is like okay we're showing you content from your friends and creators that you're following and creators that you're not following that are generating interesting things and you just add on to that a layer of okay and we're also going to show you content from um that's generated by by an AI system that might be something that you're interested in now how big do any of these segments get I think it's really hard to know until you build them out over time but it feels like it is a category in the world that's going to exist and um how big it gets is kind of dependent on the execution and how good it is why do you think it needs to exist as a new category I'm still wrestling with why people want this I get the companionship stuff that character Ai and some startups have already shown there's like a market for um and you've talked about how Med is already being used for role playing and but the big idea is that AI has been used to inter intermediate in feed how humans reach each other and now all of a sudden AIS are going to be in feeds with us well I think the main difference and that feels big yeah but in a lot of ways the big change already happened which is people getting content that they weren't following and the definition of feeds in social interaction has changed very fundamentally in the last 10 years now in Social systems most of the direct interaction is happening in more private forums in messaging our groups and this is one of the reasons I think why we were late with reals initially to competing with Tik to is cu we we hadn't made this mental shift where we kind of felt like no feed is where you interact with people actually increasingly feat is becoming a place where you discover content that you then take to your private forums and interact with people there so a lot of the the the way that I interact with people it's like yeah I'll still have the thing where a friend will post something and I'll I'll comment on it and engage directly in feed um again you know this is additive you're adding more over time um but the main way that you engage with reals isn't necessarily that you know you go into the reals comments and comment and talk to people you don't know it's like you see something funny and you send it to friends in a group chat right and I I think that that Paradigm will absolutely continue with AI and all kinds of interesting content so it is facilitating connections with people um but I think already we're in this mode where our connections through social media are shifting to more private places and the role of Feed in the ecosystem is more as a you know I call it a discovery engine content to kind of um you know of ice breakers or interesting kind of topic starters for the conversations that you're having um across this like broader spectrum of places where you're interacting do you worry about people interacting with AIS like this making people less likely to talk to other people like it reducing the engagement that we have with humans the sociology that I've seen on this is that most people have way fewer friends physically than they would like to have I think people cherish the kind of human connection that they have and the more we can do to make that feel more real and give you more reasons to connect whether it's through something funny that shows up so you can message someone or a pair of glasses that lets like you your sister show up as a hologram in your living room when you you know she lives across the country and you wouldn't be able to see her otherwise like that's always kind of our main bread and butter and the thing that we're doing but you know in addition to that I mean if the you know the average person I think you know maybe they'd like to have 10 friends and I mean there's the stat that it's like it's sort of sad but I think the the average American feels like they have fewer than three like real kind of close friends so does this take away from that my guess is no I I think that what's going to happen is it's going to help um give people more of the support that they need and give people more kind of reasons and ability to connect with either a broader range of people or more deeply with the people who they care about how are you feeling about how threads is doing these days I mean threads on fire it's great I mean it's I mean these things it's like there's only so quickly that something can get to a billion people so it's G to you know we'll kind of keep on pushing on it over I've heard it's still using Instagram a lot for growth like I'm guess I'm wondering when do you see it getting to like a I mean of Standalone growth driver on its own I mean I think that these things all connect to each other so I I don't I mean I think threads helps Instagram I think Instagram helps threads I don't I don't know that we have some strategic goal which is like like make it so that threads is completely disconnected from Instagram or Facebook I actually think we're going the other direction it started off just connected to Instagram and now we also connected it so that the content can show up now taking a step back I me we just talked about how for most people they're interacting in more private forums if you're a Creator what you want to do is have your content show up everywhere right because you're trying to build the biggest community that you can in these different places so it's this huge value um for for people if they can generate a real or a video or some text based content and now you can post it in Threads Instagram Facebook um and more places over time so um so I think the direction there is generally kind of more flow not less and kind of more interoperability and that's that's why um I've been I've been kind of pushing on that as as a theme over time I'm not even sure what x is anymore but I think what it used to be and what Twitter used to be was a place where you went when news was happening I know you and the company seem to be distancing yourself from recommending news but with threads it feels like that's what people want and people thought threads might be but it seems like you all are intentionally saying we don't want threads to actually be that yeah I mean it's interesting there's there are different ways to to look at this um I always looked at Twitter not as primarily about realtime news but as a kind of short form primarily text discussion oriented app to me the fundamental defining aspect of that format is that you don't when you make a post the comments aren't subordinate to the Post the comments are kind of at a pure level and that is a very different architecture than every other type of of um of social network that's out there and um it's a subtle difference but Within These systems these subtle differences lead to very different emerging behaviors so because of that people can take they can Fork discussions and it makes it a very good discussion oriented platform now news is one thing that people like discussing um but it's not the only thing and I always looked at Twitter and I was like hey this is such a wasted opportunity like this is clearly a billion person app um you know maybe in the modern day when you have multiple like many billions of people using social apps it should be multiple billions of people and for whatever reason I mean there was there are a lot of things that have been complicated about Twitter and the corporate structure and all that but they just weren't quite getting there and eventually you know I kind of thought hey I think we can do this I think we can get this like build out the discussion platform in in a way that can get to a billion people and be more of a ubiquitous social platform that I think achieves the um the fullness of what what what what it like its full potential but our version of this is we wanted to be a Kinder place right we don't want to start with kind of the like direct kind of head-to-head combat of news um and especially politics and um you feel like that constrains the growth of the product at all I mean I think I think we'll see we'll run the experiment um or that that needs to exist in the world cuz I feel like with x's seeming implosion it's not really existing anymore maybe I'm biased to someone in the media but I do think I do think people want when something big happens in the world they want an app that they can go to and see everyone that they follow talking about it immediately yeah well there's not we're not the only company I there's there were like a ton of different competitors and different companies doing things and you know I mean I think that there's a talented team over at Twitter and and um so so I I I I wouldn't write them off um and you know then obviously there's all these other folks and there's a lot of startups that are doing stuff so I don't feel like we have to go with that first I I think that like maybe we get there over time or maybe we decide that it's enough of a zero sum trade or maybe even a negative sum trade where like that that use case should exists somewhere but maybe that use case prevents a lot more usage um and and kind of a lot more value in other places because it makes it a somewhat less friendly place and um I I don't think we know the answer to that yet but I I do think the last 10 years eight years of um of our experience has been that the political discourse is um it's It's Tricky right it's on the one hand it's obviously a very important thing in society and on the other hand I don't think it leaves people feeling good so I'm torn between these two values on the one hand I I think like people should be able to have this kind of open discourse and that's good on the other hand I don't want to design a product that makes people angry right it's like I mean is like there's an informational lens for looking at this and there's kind of a you're designing a product and like what's the feel of the product right it's like I think anyone who's designing a product cares a lot about how the thing feels and but you Rec you recognize the importance of that discussion happening in the world I think it's useful and look we don't block it you know we we just make it so that um you know for the content where you're following people if you want to talk to your friends about it if you want to talk to them about it in messaging there can be groups about it um if you follow people it can show up in your feed but we don't go out of our way to recommend that content when you're not following it and I think that that has been a healthy balance for us and for getting our products to generally feel the way that we want um and you know culture changes over time maybe the stuff will be like a little bit less polarized and anger inducing at some point and maybe it'll be possible to have more of that while also at the same time having a product where we're proud of how it feels but until then I think we we just we want to we want to design a product that um yeah people can get the things that they want but um but you know fundamentally we we um I care a lot about how people feel coming away from the products do you see this decision to to downrank political content for people that who aren't being followed um in feed as a political decision I guess because I don't know you're also at the same time you know not really saying much about the election this year you're not donating you've said you kind of want to stay out of it now and I see the way the company's acting and it reflects your personal kind of way you're operating right now and I'm wondering like how much more of it is also about what you and the company have gone through and the political environment and not necessarily just what users are telling you sure um like is there a through line there I I mean I'm sure it's all connected I think in this case it wasn't a trade-off between those two things because this actually was what our community was telling us and people were saying generally we don't want so much politics it it like this isn't you know like we don't feel good like like I we want like we we want content to that we want more stuff from our friends and family we want more stuff from our interests um so that that was kind of the primary driver but I think it's definitely the case that our corporate experience on this um shaped this and there's a big difference between something being political and being partisan and the main thing that I care about is making sure that we can be seen as a nonpartisan and you know as much as something can in the world in 2024 be sort of like a trusted institution by as many people as possible and um I just think that the partisan politics is so tough in the world right now that um I've made the decision that I I kind of feel like for me and for the company um best thing to do is to try to be as nonpartisan as possible in in in all of this and and kind of be be kind of as as neutral and and distance ourselves as much as possible and it's not just the substance I also think the perception matters so I think um so that's why you maybe you know it doesn't matter on our platforms whether I endorse a candidate or not but like I don't even I don't want to go anywhere near um and yeah I mean you could say that's a political strategy um but I think it's um I think for where we are in the world today it's very hard almost every institution has become partisan in some way and we are just trying to resist that and maybe I'm too naive and maybe that's impossible but that's we're going to try to do that on the acquired podcast recently you said that the political miscalculation was a 20-year mistake and a brand from a brand perspective and was going to take another 10 or so for you to fully work through that cycle yeah what makes you think it's such a lasting thing because you look at like how you personally have kind of evolved over the last couple years and I think perception of the company has evolved and I'm wondering like what you meant by saying it's going to take another 10 years I'm just talking about where our brand is and our reputation are compared to where I think they would have been I mean there's no doubt that even now here and okay yeah sure maybe things have improved somewhat over the last few years you can feel the trend but it's still significantly worse than it was in 2016 um you know it's I mean the internet industry overall um and I think our company in particular um just were seeing way more positively and now look there were real issues right so so I I I I think that it's always very difficult to talk about this stuff in a nuanced way because um I think to some Dee before 2016 everyone was sort of too Rosy about the internet overall and didn't talk enough about the issues and then the pendulum sort of swung and people only talked about the issues and didn't talk about the stuff that was positive and it was all both there the whole time um but so when I talk about this I don't mean to you know come across as simplistic or um you know you guys didn't do anything wrong or anything like or that there weren't issues with the Internet or things like that I mean obviously every year you know whether it's politics or other things there always things that you look back at and you're like hey yeah like if I were playing this perfectly I would have done these things differently and um but I do think it's the case that I didn't really know how to react to something as big of of of sort of a shift in the world as what happened and it took me a while to find my footing and and I I I do think that It's Tricky when you're caught up in these kind of big debates and you're not kind of experienced or sophisticated and engaging with that I think um you can make some big missteps and I I do think that some of the things that um that that that we were accused of over time it just you know I think it's just been pretty clear at this point you know now that all the investigations have been done that like they they weren't true um and you're talking about like Cambridge analytica I think C analytica is a good example of something that it's like people thought that like all this data had been taken and that um it had been used in this campaign and out wasn't and like and yeah so it's like all the stuff okay the data wasn't even you know accessible to the to the developer and and we'd fix the issue like five years ago so um but in the moment it was like really hard for us to to kind of have a rational discussion about that and I think part of the challenge is that um you know for the general population I think a lot of people they read the initial headlines and they don't necessarily read the um you know and and and frankly you know a lot of the media I don't think was like as loud to write about when all the invest concluded that said that there weren't um that like a lot of the initial allegations were just completely wrong so I I think that's like a that's a real thing so okay so you take these hits and I didn't really know how to how to kind of push back on that and maybe some of it you can't but I I like to think that I think we could have played this some of this stuff differently um and I do think it was certainly the case that when you take responsibility for things that are not your fault you become sort of a weak Target for people who are looking to blame other things and find a target for them and it's sort of like um this is a different part of of of it's it's somewhat related to this but when you think about like like litigation strategy for the company one of the reason why I hate settling lawsuits is that it it basically sends a signal to people that hey this is a company that settles lawsuits so maybe like we can sue them and they'll settle lawsuits so um so you wouldn't write a blank check to the government like Google did for its antitrust case no I think like I think the right kind of way to approach this is when you believe in something you fight really hard for it and I think this is a repeat game this isn't like this it's not like there's a single issue and we're going to be around for a long time and I think it's it's really important that people know that we're a company that has conviction and that we we believe in what we're doing and we're going to back that up and defend ourselves and I think that that kind of sets the right tone um now now I think over the next 10 years I think we're sort of digging ourselves back to neutral on this and but I I like to think that if we hadn't had a lot of these issues we would have made progress over the last 10 years too so I sort of give it this time frame maybe 20 years is too long maybe it's 15 but it's hard to know with politics it feels like mental health and youth mental health may be the next wave of this that that I think is the next big fight and and on that you know I think a lot of the data on this I I think is just not where the narrative is the The Narrative yeah I think the narrative is a lot of people sort of take it as um as if it's like an assumed thing that there's some link and like I think the majority of the of the high quality research that's out there suggests that there's no causal connection like a at kind of a broad scale between between these things so um now look I mean I think that that's different from saying like in any given issue like was is someone bullied should we try to stop bullying yeah of course um but yeah overall um I I I think that this is this is one where there there are a bunch of these cases I think that there will be a lot of litigation around them uh and it's one where we're trying to make sure that the academic research that that shows something that that I think is you it um you know to me it sort of foots more with what I've seen of how the platforms operate but it's counter to what a lot of people think and I think that that's going to be a reckoning that we'll have to have is is basically when as the the kind of the majority of the highquality academic research um kind of gets shown is like Okay can people accept this and I think that's going to be a really important um set of debates over the next year at the same time you guys have acknowledged there's affordances in the product like the teen roll out with Instagram recently that you can make to make the product a better experience for young people yeah and I think this is an interesting part of the balance is um you can play a role in trying to make something better even if the thing wasn't caused by you in the first place like there's no doubt that being being a parent is really hard and there's a big question of in this internet age where we have phones um what are the right tools that parents need in order to be able to raise their kids and like I think that we can play a role in giving people controls over U parental controls over the apps I think that parental controls are also really important because parents have different ways that they want to raise their kids or just like schooling and education people have like very significantly different local preferences for how they want to raise their kids I don't think that most people want some internet company setting all the rules for this either so obviously you know when there are laws passed we'll we'll kind of follow the the the government's Direction and and and the laws on that but I actually think the right approach for us is to primarily kind of align with parents to give them the tools that they want to be able to raise their kids in the way that they want and some people are going to think that more technology use is good that's sort of how my parents you know Raised Me growing Up um I think it worked pretty well um some people are going to be kind of more more um you know want to limit it more and we want to give them the tools to be able to do that but but I don't think that this is you know primarily or only a social media thing um even even the parts of this that are technology age verification I think phones like the phone platforms have a huge part of this this I mean it's um yeah there's this big question of how do you do age verification and I mean I can tell you what the easiest way is which is like all right like every time you go do a payment on your phone I mean there already is child um you know basically like child age verification so I don't really understand well I guess I understand but I think it's it's it's not very um you know excusable from my perspective why apple and and and um I guess to some extent Google don't want to just extend the age verification that they already have on their phones to be a parental control for parents to to basically be able to say what um you what apps can my kids use right it's hard for me to not see the logic in it either I don't I don't really I think they don't want to take responsibility but maybe that's on Congress then to pass who has to take responsibility yeah yeah so and and and we're going to do our part and we're going to we're going to build the tools that we can for for parents and for and for teens um but it the end of the day um I I and look I'm not saying it's all the phone's fault either although I I would say that like the ability to get push notifications and get kind of distracted is from my perspective seems like a much greater contributor to mental health issues than um than than kind of a lot of the specific apps but but there are things that that I think everyone should should kind of try to improve and work on um but yeah I mean I that that's sort of that's sort of my view on all that on the regul piece as it relates to AI you've been very vocal about what's happening in the EU and uh you recently signed an open letter and I believe it was saying basically that you guys just don't have Clarity on consent for training how it's supposed to work um and I'm wondering what you think needs to happen there for things to move forward because like Med AI is not available in Europe new llama models are not um is that something you see getting resolved uh at all I guess and what would it take yeah I don't know it's it's a little hard for me to parse the the European politics um I have a hard time enough with American politics I mean it's and and I'm I'm American but um so in theory my understanding of the way this is supposed to work is they they kind of passed this gdpr regulation and you're supposed to have this this idea of sort of a One-Stop shop like home regulator who can basically on behalf of the whole EU interpret and enforce the rules and we have our European headquarters and we work with that regulator and you know I think they're like okay they're pretty tough on us and pretty firm but at least when you're working with one regulator you can kind of understand how are they thinking about things and it's and you can make progress and the thing that I think has been tricky is there there have been from from my perspective a little bit of a backslide where now you get all these other um dpas across the continent sort of also intervening and and trying to do things and it just seems like more of an kind of internal EU political thing which is like okay do they want to have this One-Stop shop and have Clarity for companies so companies can act can kind of like can execute or or do they just want it to be this kind of very complicated regulatory system and um I look I think that's for them to out um but but I know there's no doubt that when you have like dozens of different Regulators that can ask you kind of the same questions about different things it makes it a much more difficult environment to build things do you do I don't think that that's just us I think that that's all the company but do you understand the concern people have about training data and creators even and this idea that their data is being used for these models they're not getting compensated and the models are creating a lot of value and I know you're giving away llama but you're still you've got M Ai and I understand the frustration that people have about that I think it's a naturally bad feeling to be like oh my my data is now being used in a new way that I have no control or compensation over do you do you sympathize with that yeah I mean I think that there in any new medium and Technology there's like the concepts around fair use and like where are the boundaries between what you have control over right when you put something out in the world to what degree do you still get to control it and and kind of own it and license it um and I I think that all these things are basically going to get need to get you know relitigated and rediscussed in the um in the in the AI era so I'm I get it I I I think that these are these are important questions I think this is not like a completely novel thing to AI in in the grand scheme of things I think it was you a lot of them there were questions about it with with the internet overall too and with different Technologies over time um and but I think getting to clarity that is going to be important so that way the things that Society wants people to build they can go build what is Clarity look like to you there I mean I think it starts with having some framework of like okay what's the process going to be if we're working through that but but you don't see a scenario where creators get like directly compensated for the use of their content I think that there's a lot of different possibilities for how stuff goes in the future now I do think that there's this issue which is a lot of like while psychologically I understand what you're saying yeah I think individual creators or Publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content right so it's like okay maybe like in in in like in the grand scheme of this right so um so we have this set of challenges with with um you know news Publishers around the world which is like okay they they're like a lot of folks are constantly kind of asking to be paid for the content and on the other hand we have of our community which is asking us to show less news because it makes them feel bad right and I mean we talked about that so it's like there's this issue which is okay it's like actually we're showing some amount of the news that we're showing because we think it's socially important against what our community wants like if we were actually just following our our our what our what our community wants we'd show even less than we're showing um and you see that in the data that people just don't like to engage with this stuff and we've had these issues where sometimes we like Publishers say okay if you're not going to pay us then pull our cont down and it's just like yeah Share Fine pull pull your content down I mean that sucks I'd rather people be able to share it but but if but I think some to some degree some of these questions have to get tested by their negotiations and they have to get tested by people walking and and like and then at the end once people walk you figure out where the value really is right if if it if it really is the case that that news was a big thing the community wanted then I mean look we're we're a big company we could you know we we could probably you know we pay for Content when it's valuable to people we're just not going to pay for Content when it's not valuable to people um so I think that you'll probably see a similar Dynamic with AI which is my guess is that there are going to be certain Partnerships that get made when content is really important and valuable um and i' guess that there's probably a lot of people who are kind of have a a concern about like the feel of it like you're saying but then when push comes to shove if like if they demanded that we take that we don't use their content then we just wouldn't use their content and it's not like you know that's going to change the outcome of this stuff that much I guess to bring this full circle where we started uh as you're building augmented reality glasses um and what you've learned over just the societal implications of the stuff you've built over the last decade um how are you thinking about this as it relates to glasses at scale because you're literally going to be augmented augmenting reality which is a it's a responsibility I think that's going to be another platform too and you're going to have a lot of these questions as well I mean I think the interesting thing about Holograms and augmented reality is it's going to be this intermingling of the physical and digital much more than we've had in other platforms um where on your phone it's like okay yeah we we live a primarily physical world but then you have the small window into this digital world and I think we're going to basically have this world in the future that is increasingly you know call it half physical half digital or I don't know 60% physical 40% digital and it's like and it's um going to be Blended together and I think that there are going to be a lot of interesting governance questions around that right in terms of um like is is kind of all of the digital stuff that's overlaid physically going to fit within sort of a physical kind of national regulation perspective or is it sort of is it actually coming from a different world or something you know and and um I think these will all be very interesting questions that we will have a perspective I'm sure we're not going to be right about every single thing um I I think like the world will kind of need to sort out where it wants to be different countries will have different values and take somewhat different approaches on things and I think that that's it's part of the interesting process of this the the tapestry of how it all gets built is like is um you need to work through so that it ends up being positive for you know as many of the possible stakeholders as possible more to come yeah a lot to come yeah thanks Mark okay cool good game good game you you haveen anage that's all right I've played a few more cool all right done
