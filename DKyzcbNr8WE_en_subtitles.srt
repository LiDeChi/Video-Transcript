1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,100
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,769
john hopfield professor Princeton whose

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:10,619
life's work weave beautifully through

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:13,710
biology chemistry neuroscience and

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:15,869
physics most crucially he saw the messy

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,080
world of biology through the piercing

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,239
eyes of a physicist he's perhaps best

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:24,358
known for his work on associative neural

9
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:26,759
networks now known as hopfield networks

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,710
that were one of the early ideas that

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,579
catalyzed the development of the modern

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,649
field of deep learning as his 2019

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,020
Franklin medal in physics award States

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,239
he applied concepts of theoretical

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,190
physics to provide new insights and

16
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,828
important biological questions in a

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,439
variety of areas including genetics and

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,439
neuroscience was significant impact on

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,920
machine learning and as John says in his

20
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,709
2018 article titled now what his

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,219
accomplishments have often come about by

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,100
asking that very question now what and

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,800
often responding by a major change of

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,659
direction

25
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,479
this is the artificial intelligence

Friedman spelled Fri D ma M as usual

31
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,119
I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

32
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:24,829
and never any ads in the middle that can

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,290
break the flow of the conversation I

34
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:30,289
hope that works for you and doesn't hurt

35
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,360
the listening experience this show is

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,520
presented by cash app the number one

37
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:38,569
finance app in the App Store when you

38
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:40,579
get it use colex podcast cash app lets

39
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,529
you send money to friends buy Bitcoin

40
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,679
and invest in the stock market with as

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,390
little as $1 since cash app does

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
fractional share trading let me mention

43
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,500
that the order execution algorithm that

44
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,109
works behind the scenes to create the

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,109
abstraction of fractional orders is to

46
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:59,149
me an algorithmic marvel so big props to

47
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:01,310
the cash app engineers for solving a

48
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:03,590
heart problem that in the end provides

49
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,540
an easy interface that takes a step up

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,520
the next layer of abstraction over the

51
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,520
stock market making trading more

52
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,699
accessible for new investors and

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,350
diversification much easier so again if

54
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:17,869
you get cash up from the App Store or

55
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:20,419
Google Play and use collects podcast

56
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,759
you'll get ten dollars in cash app will

57
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,409
also donate ten dollars the first one of

58
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,479
my favorite organizations that is

59
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:28,340
helping advanced robotics and STEM

60
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,669
education for young people around the

61
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,500
world and now here's my conversation

62
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,500
with john hopfield

63
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,399
biological neural networks and

64
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:44,989
artificial neural networks is most

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,599
captivating and profound to you at the

66
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:51,709
higher philosophical level let's not get

67
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:54,968
technical just yet one of the things

68
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:59,530
very much intrigues me is the fact that

69
00:02:54,968 --> 00:03:04,608
neurons have all kinds of components

70
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:06,919
properties to them and evolutionary

71
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:10,250
biology if you have some little quirk

72
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:13,039
and I even how a molecule works or how

73
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:16,039
it still works and it can may mean use

74
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,679
of evolution will sharpen it up and make

75
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:23,289
it into a useful feature rather than a

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,239
glitch and so you expect in neurobiology

77
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:29,150
for evolution to have captured all kinds

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,549
of possibilities of getting neurons of

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,780
how you get neurons to do things for you

80
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:39,400
and that aspect has been completely

81
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,579
suppressed in artificial neural networks

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,879
so the glitches become features in them

83
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:49,849
in the biological neural network they

84
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:54,318
they can look let me take one of the

85
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:58,848
things that I used to do research on if

86
00:03:54,318 --> 00:04:01,969
you take things which oscillate their

87
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,098
rhythms which are sort of close to each

88
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:06,949
other under some circumstances these

89
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:08,568
things will have a phase transition and

90
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,909
suddenly is the rhythm will everybody

91
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:13,478
will fall into step there was a

92
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:16,430
marvelous physical example of that in

93
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:21,520
the millenium bridge across the Thames

94
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,139
River about Bill about 2001 and

95
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,418
pedestrians walking across pedestrians

96
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,699
don't walk synchronized they don't walk

97
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:31,788
and lock lockstep but they're all

98
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:33,860
walking about the same frequency and the

99
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:36,348
bridge could say at that frequency in

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,389
the slight sway made pedestrians tend a

101
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:40,610
little bit to lock in the step master

102
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:43,038
well the bridge was oscillating back and

103
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,060
forth and the pedestrians were walking

104
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:47,189
in step to it you could see

105
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,668
we made it at the bridge and the

106
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:52,139
engineers made a simple-minded a mistake

107
00:04:49,668 --> 00:04:55,469
they had a feeling when you walk it's

108
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:58,079
step step step and it's back at forth

109
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,120
motion but when you walk it's also right

110
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,250
foot left foot side to side motion and

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,840
the side to side motion for which the

112
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,779
bridge was strong enough but it wasn't

113
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,489
it wasn't stiff enough and as a result

114
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,949
you would feel the motion and you'd fall

115
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,629
under step with it and people were very

116
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,610
uncomfortable with it they closed the

117
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:21,930
bridge for two years really fully built

118
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,090
stiffening for it no nerves look nerve

119
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,560
cells loose action potentials you have a

120
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:27,779
bunch of cells which are loosely coupled

121
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,879
together perusing action potentials of

122
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,759
the same rate there'll be some

123
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,839
circumstances under which these things

124
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,120
can lock together other circumstances

125
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,279
which they won't

126
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,899
well they fire together you can be sure

127
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,819
the other cells are going to notice it

128
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,149
so you could make a computational

129
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:51,269
feature out of this and you're in an

130
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:52,829
evolving brain most artificial neural

131
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,288
networks don't even have action

132
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:59,849
potentials let alone have the Potala

133
00:05:55,288 --> 00:06:01,889
bility for synchronizing them and you

134
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,530
mentioned the evolutionary process so

135
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,579
they're the evolutionary process that

136
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:14,279
builds on top of biological systems

137
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:16,949
leverage is that the the weird mess of

138
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,159
it somehow so how do you make sense of

139
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:22,370
that ability to leverage all the

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,400
different kinds of complexities in the

141
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:30,060
biological brain well look in the part

142
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,000
of the biological molecule level you

143
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,490
have a piece of DNA which included an

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,379
encode for a particular protein you

145
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,650
could duplicate that piece of DNA and

146
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:42,060
now one part of it

147
00:06:40,649 --> 00:06:45,209
encode for that protein but the other

148
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,889
one could itself change a little bit and

149
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,930
the start coding for a molecule which is

150
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,538
just slightly different now is that

151
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,079
molecule was just slightly different had

152
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:57,389
it in a function which helped any old

153
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,750
chemical reaction was as important to

154
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,750
the cell

155
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,829
you would go ahead and let that e try an

156
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,129
evolution of slowly and improve that

157
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:13,689
function and so you have the possibility

158
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:15,759
of duplicating and then having things

159
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:17,860
drift apart one of them retain the old

160
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,110
function the other one do something new

161
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,569
for you

162
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,389
and there's evolutionary pressure to

163
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,490
improve look there isn't computers to

164
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:30,389
adjust improvement has to do with

165
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,040
closing some companies openings others

166
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,860
the evolutionary process looks a little

167
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,129
different yeah oh similar timescale

168
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,830
perhaps well or shorter in times to kill

169
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:45,219
companies close yeah go bankrupt and are

170
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:48,129
born yeah shorter but not much shorter

171
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,400
some some company lasts the century a

172
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,959
couple but yeah you're right I mean if

173
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,750
you think of companies a single organism

174
00:07:52,959 --> 00:08:00,579
that builds and you all know yeah it's a

175
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:03,069
fascinating dual correspondence there

176
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:05,680
between biological and companies have

177
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,719
difficulty having a new product

178
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,970
competing with an old fraud large yeah

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,070
and when IBM built this first PC you

180
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:18,070
probably read the dread the book they

181
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,839
made a little isolated internal unit to

182
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:23,560
make the PC and for the first time in

183
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:27,789
IBM's history they didn't insist that

184
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,319
you build it out of IBM components but

185
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,259
they understood that they could get into

186
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,990
this market which is a very different

187
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:41,729
thing by completely changing their

188
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:46,899
culture and biology finds other markets

189
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,280
in a more adaptive way he adds better at

190
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:52,509
it it's better at that kind of

191
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:54,970
integration so maybe you've already said

192
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:59,819
it but what to use the most beautiful

193
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,820
aspect or mechanism of the human mind

194
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:06,689
is it the adaptive the ability to adapt

195
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,399
as you've described there's there some

196
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,639
other little quirk that you particularly

197
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:18,299
like adaptation is everything when you

198
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,899
get down to it but the difference there

199
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:24,448
are differences between adaptation where

200
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:27,480
your learning goes on on the over

201
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:29,729
generation that over evolutionary time

202
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,250
or your learning goes on at the

203
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,190
timescale of one individual who must

204
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:40,139
learn from the environment during that

205
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:44,519
individuals lifetime and biology has

206
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,250
both kinds of learning in it and the

207
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:52,769
thing which makes neurobiology hard is

208
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:55,799
that a mathematical systems that were

209
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:59,730
built on this other kind of evolutionary

210
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:02,129
system what do you mean by mathematical

211
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,470
system where where's the math in the

212
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,958
biology well when you talk to a computer

213
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,019
scientist about neural networks it's all

214
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:13,828
math the fact that biology actually came

215
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:19,019
about from evolution the thing and the

216
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:24,318
fact that biology is about a system

217
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,318
which you can build in three dimensions

218
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,600
if you look at computer chips computer

219
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:34,949
chips are basically two dimensional

220
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,709
structures a 2.1 dimensions but they

221
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:40,828
really have difficulty doing

222
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:44,039
three-dimensional wiring biology biology

223
00:10:40,828 --> 00:10:46,979
is the neocortex is actually also

224
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,629
sheet-like and it sits on top of the

225
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,339
white matter which is about ten times

226
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:52,620
the volume of the gray matter and

227
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:58,949
contains all what you might call the

228
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:02,429
wires but there's a huge the the effect

229
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:07,490
the effect of computer structure on what

230
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:12,719
is easy and what is hard is immense

231
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:15,600
so and biology does makes some things

232
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,910
easy that are very difficult to

233
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,040
understand how to do computationally on

234
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,838
the other hand you can't do simple

235
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,549
floating-point arithmetic because though

236
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,079
it's awfully stupid yeah

237
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,740
and you're saying this kind of three

238
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:32,489
dimensional complicated structure makes

239
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,440
it's still math it still doing math the

240
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,579
kind of math is doing enables you to

241
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,800
solve problems of a very different kind

242
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:43,379
that's right that's right

243
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:46,019
so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation

244
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,088
the evolutionary adaptation at the end

245
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,100
the adaptation are learning at the scale

246
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:56,250
of a single human life which do you are

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:59,550
which is particularly beautiful to you

248
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,610
and interesting from a research and from

249
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:05,069
just a human perspective and which is

250
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,620
more powerful

251
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,340
I find things most interesting that I

252
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,740
begin to see how to get into the edges

253
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,850
edges of them and tease them apart a

254
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,460
little bit see how they work and since I

255
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:27,509
can't see the evolutionary process going

256
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:30,180
on I am in awe of it but I find it just

257
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:32,519
a black hole as far as trying to

258
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,729
understand what to do and so in a

259
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,629
certain sense I'm a doll but I couldn't

260
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,320
be interested in working on it

261
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:47,879
the human life timescale is however

262
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,129
thing you can tease apart and study yeah

263
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:52,230
you can do there's developmental

264
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:57,689
neurobiology which understands all of

265
00:12:52,230 --> 00:13:01,259
these connections and now the structure

266
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,740
evolves from a combination of what the

267
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,659
genetics is like and the real the fact

268
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:11,730
that this is you're building a system in

269
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:15,240
three dimensions in just days and months

270
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,480
those early early days of human life are

271
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,879
really interesting they are and of

272
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,259
course there are times of immense still

273
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:29,610
multiplication there are also times of

274
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:34,980
the craziest cell death in the brain is

275
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:38,370
during infancy it's turnover so what is

276
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,649
what what what is not effective which is

277
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,460
not wired well enough to use the moment

278
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:49,139
throw it out it's a mysterious process

279
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,639
from let me ask from what field do you

280
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,100
think the biggest breakthroughs in

281
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,159
understanding the mind will come in the

282
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,399
next decades

283
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:03,120
is it neural science computer science

284
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:06,019
neurobiology psychology physics maybe

285
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,278
math maybe literature

286
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:10,750
[Laughter]

287
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,149
well of course I see the world always

288
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,159
through a lens of physics I grew up in

289
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:19,328
physics

290
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:22,240
and the way I pick problems is very

291
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:24,250
characteristic of physics and of an

292
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,740
intellectual background which is not

293
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,519
psychology which is not chemistry and so

294
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,039
on and so on

295
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,698
at both the air parents of physicists

296
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,289
both of our parents were physicists and

297
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:38,889
the real thing I gathered that was a

298
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:42,399
feeling that the world is an

299
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:45,610
understandable place and if you do

300
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,370
enough experiments and think about what

301
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,250
they mean and structure things that you

302
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,110
can do the mathematics of the relevant

303
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,549
of the experiments you also be able to

304
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:59,438
understand how things work but that was

305
00:14:56,549 --> 00:15:03,578
that was a few years ago did you change

306
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:05,578
your mind at all through many decades of

307
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:07,688
trying to understand the mind of

308
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,138
studying in different kinds of ways not

309
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:13,000
even the minds just biological systems

310
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:17,829
you still have hope the physics that you

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,828
can understand there's the question of

312
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:23,258
what do you mean by understand of course

313
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:25,448
when I taught freshman physics I used to

314
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:27,310
say I wanted to get physics to

315
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:30,419
understand the subject to understand new

316
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:34,299
this laws I didn't want them simply to

317
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:36,729
memorize a set of examples to which they

318
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:39,370
knew the equations to write down to

319
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:43,300
generate the answers I had this nebulous

320
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,818
idea of understanding so the if you

321
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,859
looked at a situation you can say oh I

322
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:51,370
expect the bowl to make that trajectory

323
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:56,980
all right I expect so I'm into a notion

324
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:58,990
of understanding and I don't know how to

325
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,980
express that very well I've never known

326
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,110
how to express it well and you run smack

327
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,050
up against it well you choose these look

328
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:12,909
at these simple neural Nets feed-forward

329
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:16,058
neural Nets which do amazing things and

330
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:18,698
yet you know contain nothing of the

331
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:21,159
essence of what I would have felt was

332
00:16:18,698 --> 00:16:24,818
understanding attending is more than

333
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:27,730
just an enormous lookup table let's

334
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:29,599
linger on that how sure you are of that

335
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:34,730
what if the table gets read

336
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,278
Liebig so i'm he asks another way these

337
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,399
feed-forward neural networks do you

338
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:43,578
think they'll ever understand

339
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:47,870
good answer that in two ways I think if

340
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:51,019
you look at real systems feedback is an

341
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,899
essential aspect of how these real

342
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,850
systems compute on the other hand if I

343
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:59,318
have a mathematical system with feedback

344
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:02,899
I know I can unlaid this and do it a

345
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:05,178
part of it but but I have an exponential

346
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:07,250
expansion and the amount of stuff I have

347
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,220
to build if I could resolve the problem

348
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:14,288
that way so feedback is essential so we

349
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,730
can talk even about recurrent recurrence

350
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:20,838
but do you think all the pieces are

351
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:23,659
there to achieve understanding through

352
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,849
these simple mechanisms like back to our

353
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,679
original question what is the

354
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,359
fundamental is there a fundamental

355
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,630
difference between artificial neural

356
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,418
networks and biological or is it just a

357
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:41,559
bunch of surface stuff suppose you ask a

358
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:44,570
neurosurgeon when does somebody did yeah

359
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:48,259
it'll probably go back to saying well I

360
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:49,668
can look at the brain rhythms and tell

361
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,769
you this is a brain which has never

362
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,480
could have functioned again this is one

363
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:57,308
another but this other one is one which

364
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,929
if we treat it well is still recoverable

365
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:03,048
and then just do that by so many

366
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:06,860
electrodes looking at simple like

367
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:08,960
electrical patterns just don't look in

368
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:15,798
any detail at all or what individual

369
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:18,650
neurons are doing these rhythms are

370
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:21,400
already absent from anything which goes

371
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,400
on in Google

372
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,370
yeah but the rhythms but the rhythms

373
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:34,080
would so well that's like comparing okay

374
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:37,569
I'll tell you it's like you're comparing

375
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,210
the the greatest classical musician in

376
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:42,279
the world to child first learning to

377
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:45,220
play the question I'm at but they're

378
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:49,869
still both playing the piano I'm asking

379
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:52,690
is there will it ever go on at Google do

380
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,879
you have a hope because you're one of

381
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:58,090
the seminal figures in both launching

382
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,700
both disciplines both sides of the of

383
00:18:58,089 --> 00:19:05,949
the river I think it's going to go on

384
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,519
generation after generation the way it

385
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:13,029
has where what you might call the AI

386
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,950
computer science community says let's

387
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,529
take the following this is our model of

388
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:21,519
Neurobiology at the moment let's pretend

389
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:25,000
it's good enough and do everything we

390
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:28,480
can with it and it does interesting

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,490
things and after the while sort of

392
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,240
grinds into the sand and you say Oh

393
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,370
something else is needed from

394
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,269
neurobiology and some other grand thing

395
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:44,199
comes in and enables you to go a lot

396
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:46,240
further according to the sandakan

397
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,400
everything it could be generations of

398
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,079
this evolution I don't know how many of

399
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,259
them and each one is going to get you

400
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:57,399
further into what a brain does whatever

401
00:19:53,259 --> 00:20:05,379
then in some sense passed the Turing

402
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:07,180
test longer and more broad aspects and

403
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,540
how many of these are good there are

404
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,960
going to have to be before you say I've

405
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:16,690
made something I've made a human I don't

406
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,210
know but your sense is it might be a

407
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:25,269
couple my senses might be a couple more

408
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:28,170
yeah and going back to my brain waves of

409
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:28,170
the word yes

410
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:35,620
from the AI point of view if they would

411
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:41,079
say ah maybe these are heavy phenomena

412
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:47,888
and not important at all the first car I

413
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:50,129
had no record of 1936 dodge Kobo 45

414
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:55,949
miles an hour in the wheels was Jimmy

415
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:59,440
yeah good good speedometer that

416
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:01,659
now don't be designed at the car that

417
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,139
way the cars malfunctioning to have that

418
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,389
but in biology if you if it were useful

419
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:10,209
to know when are you going more than 45

420
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:11,558
miles an hour you just capture that and

421
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,620
you wouldn't worry about where it came

422
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:13,619
from

423
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:21,839
yeah it'll be a long time before that

424
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:25,419
kind of thing which can take place in

425
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:27,459
large complex networks of things is

426
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:32,169
actually used in the computation

427
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:35,350
look-the how many transistors are there

428
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:37,750
at your laptop these days actually I

429
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,668
don't know the number it's it's on a

430
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,569
scale of 10 to the 10 I can't remember

431
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,559
the number

432
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:46,720
yeah and all the transistors are

433
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:50,138
somewhat similar and most physical

434
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,750
systems with that many parts all of

435
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:56,579
which are selfs or have collective

436
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,359
properties yes soundly is an error

437
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:02,888
Earthquakes what have you have

438
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:05,408
collective properties wither there are

439
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:11,199
no collective properties used in

440
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:12,130
artificial neural networks in AI yeah

441
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,190
it's very

442
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:17,169
if biology uses them it's gonna take us

443
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,759
two more generations of things to be the

444
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:23,320
perfect people to actually dig in and

445
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:26,259
see how they are used what they mean see

446
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:30,189
you're very right might have to return

447
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:35,288
several times to neurobiology and try to

448
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:38,019
make our transistors more messy yo-yo at

449
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:42,709
the same time the simple ones whole

450
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:46,078
concert will conquer big aspects

451
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:52,200
and I think one of the most biggest

452
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:53,808
surprises to me was how well learning

453
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,450
systems buzzer manifesting

454
00:22:53,808 --> 00:23:00,538
non-biological how important they can be

455
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:04,379
actually and you how important how

456
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:08,940
useful they can be in a high so if we

457
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:12,569
can just take a stroll to some of your

458
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,219
work that is incredibly surprising that

459
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:17,368
it works as well as it does that

460
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:20,609
launched a lot of the recent work with

461
00:23:17,368 --> 00:23:26,578
neural networks if we go to what are now

462
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:29,428
called hopfield networks can you tell me

463
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:31,069
what is associative memory in the mind

464
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:35,249
for the human side

465
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:37,788
let's explore memory for a bit okay what

466
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:41,969
do you mean by associative memory is oh

467
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:44,278
you have a memory of each of your

468
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:45,869
friends your friend has all kinds of

469
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:47,459
properties from what they look like is

470
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:51,838
whether voice sounds like to where they

471
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:54,479
went to college where you met them go on

472
00:23:51,838 --> 00:24:02,009
and on what what science papers they've

473
00:23:54,479 --> 00:24:04,578
written if I start talking about a five

474
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:06,569
foot ten wiry

475
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:09,239
cognitive scientist that's got a very

476
00:24:06,569 --> 00:24:11,338
bad back it doesn't take very long for

477
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,788
you to say are you talking about geoff

478
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:13,918
hinton

479
00:24:11,788 --> 00:24:19,288
I never been I never mentioned the name

480
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:22,528
or anything very particular but somehow

481
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:25,378
a few facts are associated with this

482
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:27,628
with a particular person enables you to

483
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:29,608
get a hold of the rest of the facts yeah

484
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:32,998
earned or not the dress that was another

485
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:37,499
subset of them and is this the ability

486
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:41,129
to link things together linked

487
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:43,348
experiences together which goes under

488
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:47,428
the general name of associative memory

489
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:50,428
and a large part of intelligent behavior

490
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:52,879
is actually just large associative

491
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,890
memories at work as far as I can see

492
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:57,589
what do you think

493
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:02,110
is the mechanism of how it works in the

494
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:05,409
mind is it is it a mystery to you still

495
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:10,219
do you have Inklings of how this

496
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:15,220
essential thing for cognition works what

497
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:19,400
I made 35 years ago was of course a

498
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:23,298
crude physics model to show the kayak

499
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,980
Chua Li enable you to understand my old

500
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:27,679
sense of understanding as a physicist

501
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,509
because you could say ah I understand

502
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,790
why this goes to stable States

503
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:36,798
it's like things going down downhill

504
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:40,190
right and that gives you something with

505
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,769
which to think in physical terms rather

506
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,830
than only in mathematical terms so

507
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:47,450
you've created these associative

508
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:49,939
artificial well that warp those right

509
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:55,990
and now if you if you look at what I did

510
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:59,808
I didn't did all describe a system which

511
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,599
gracefully learns I described as a

512
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,279
system in which you could understand how

513
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:08,949
things how learning could link things

514
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:11,298
together how very crudely it might learn

515
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:13,669
one of the things which intrigues me as

516
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:20,839
I reinvestigate that system now to some

517
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:24,679
extent is look I see you I'll see you

518
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:25,240
every second for the next hour or what

519
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,919
have you

520
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:31,599
each each look at you is a little bit

521
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,590
different I don't store all those

522
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,839
second-by-second images I don't store

523
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:41,889
3,000 images I somehow compact this

524
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:41,889
information so now I have a view of you

525
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:48,620
which can which I can use it doesn't

526
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:50,089
slavishly remember anything in

527
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:53,149
particular but it could PACs the

528
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:57,109
information in those useful chunks which

529
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:59,570
are somehow it's these chunks which are

530
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:02,269
not just activities of neurons from

531
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:04,158
bigger things than that which are the

532
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:06,759
real energies which are which are useful

533
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,399
which are useful to you

534
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:14,538
useful distal to you to describe to

535
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:17,118
compress this information present in

536
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:19,700
such a way that if I get the information

537
00:27:17,118 --> 00:27:22,418
comes in just like this again I don't

538
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,548
bother about their to rewrite it or

539
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,679
efforts to rewrite it simply do not

540
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:31,388
yield anything because those things are

541
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,330
already written and that needs to be not

542
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:37,488
look this up has ever started somewhere

543
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:40,398
already therapies not something which is

544
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:44,929
much more automatic in the machine

545
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:47,508
hardware right so in the human mind how

546
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:51,649
complicated is that process do you think

547
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:53,089
so you've created feels weird to be

548
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:56,798
sitting with john hopfield calling them

549
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:59,868
hot field networks but it is weird

550
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:03,138
yeah but nevertheless that's what

551
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:05,298
everyone calls them so here we are so

552
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,548
that's a simplification that's what a

553
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:08,929
physicists would do you and richard

554
00:28:07,548 --> 00:28:12,888
fineman sat down and talked about

555
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:15,379
associative memory now if you as a if

556
00:28:12,888 --> 00:28:19,278
you look at the mind or you can't quite

557
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:23,569
simplify so perfectly do you let me

558
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:27,798
backtrack just a little bit yep biology

559
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:33,168
is about dynamical systems computers are

560
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:37,308
dynamical systems you can have if you

561
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:40,190
want to math the bottle biology bottle

562
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:43,368
neurobiology what is the time scale

563
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,639
there's a dynamical system in which you

564
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:48,618
have a fairly fast timescale in which

565
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:50,778
you goes eight the synopsis don't change

566
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:53,358
much during this computation so I'll

567
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:56,569
think of the synapses fixed and just do

568
00:28:53,358 --> 00:29:00,348
the dynamics of the activity or you can

569
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:02,058
say the synapses are changing fast

570
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:04,729
enough that I have to have the synaptic

571
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:08,418
dynamics working at the same time as the

572
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:10,869
system dynamics in order to understand

573
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,869
the biology

574
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,219
most artists if you look at the

575
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:19,910
feed-forward art revisional their own

576
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,710
ads they're all done as learning is

577
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,690
first of all I spent some time learning

578
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:28,100
and not performing and I turned off

579
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:33,110
learning and I perform right that's not

580
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:35,089
biology and so he is there look more

581
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:38,089
deeply at neurobiology even as

582
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:39,740
associative memory I've got to face the

583
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:44,869
fact that the dynamics of a synapse

584
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:46,808
change is going on all the time and I

585
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:49,549
can't just get by by thing I'll do the

586
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:54,319
academics of activity with fixed

587
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:56,569
synapses so the the synaptic the

588
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,849
dynamics of the synapses is actually

589
00:29:56,569 --> 00:30:01,129
fundamental to the whole system yum yum

590
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:03,589
and there's no there's no there's

591
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:05,870
nothing necessarily separating the time

592
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:07,549
skills where the time skills can be

593
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:09,500
separate and it's neat for the

594
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:12,109
physicists of the mathematicians point

595
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,440
of view but it's not necessarily true in

596
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:18,049
neurobiology New York you're kind of

597
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,120
dancing beautifully between showing a

598
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:24,919
lot of respect to physics and then also

599
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:29,959
saying that physics cannot quite reach

600
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:32,058
the the complexity of biology so where

601
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,308
do you land or do you continuously dance

602
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:35,990
between the two I continuously dance

603
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:42,319
between them because my whole notion of

604
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:43,880
understanding is it you can describe to

605
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:49,149
somebody else how something works in

606
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:52,400
ways which are honest and believable and

607
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:57,440
still not described all the nuts and

608
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:03,470
bolts in detail whether I can describe

609
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,750
whether as ten to the 32 molecules

610
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,400
colliding in the atmosphere I can

611
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,200
stimulate whether that way or I pick

612
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:13,340
enough machine I'll simulate it

613
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,640
accurately it's no good for

614
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:18,169
understanding but I just want to

615
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,450
understand things I want to understand

616
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,759
things in terms of wind patterns

617
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:24,309
hurricanes pressure differentials and so

618
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:31,000
on all things is there

619
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:33,819
negative and the physicists physicists

620
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,440
in me always hopes that biology will

621
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:38,319
have some things which can be said about

622
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,870
it was are both true and for which you

623
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,929
don't need all the molecular details of

624
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:46,809
the molecules colliding that's what I

625
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:51,370
mean from the roots of physics by

626
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:53,500
understanding so what did again sorry

627
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:57,779
but hopfield networks help you

628
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:00,940
understand what insight to give us about

629
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:05,048
memory about learning

630
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:08,019
they didn't give insights about learning

631
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:12,608
they gave insights about how things

632
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:17,378
having learned could be expressed how

633
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:20,739
having learned a picture of a picture of

634
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:23,888
you reminds me of your name that would

635
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:28,450
put it describe a reasonable way of

636
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:31,178
actually doing the learning or only said

637
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,179
if he had previously learned the

638
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:37,960
connections of this kind of pattern

639
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:40,690
would now be able to behave in a

640
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,278
physical way with the day off I put the

641
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,840
part of the pattern in here the other

642
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:46,598
pattern of the pet part of the pattern

643
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:49,269
will complete over here I can understand

644
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:52,089
that physics if the right learning stuff

645
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:53,589
had already been put in and you couldn't

646
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:54,638
understand why then putting in a picture

647
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:58,178
of somebody else would generate

648
00:32:54,638 --> 00:33:00,638
something else over here but it didn't

649
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:03,970
out under did not have a reasonable

650
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:05,978
description of the learning process but

651
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,798
even to forget learning I mean that's

652
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:13,538
just a powerful concept that sort of

653
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:16,058
forming representations that are useful

654
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:19,358
to be robust you know for error

655
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:21,848
correction kind of thing so this is kind

656
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:24,819
of what the biology does we're talking

657
00:33:21,848 --> 00:33:27,489
about what my paper did was simply

658
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:34,628
enable you there long there are lots of

659
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:37,419
ways of being robust if you think of it

660
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:40,509
a dividend amical system here you think

661
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:43,389
of a system where a path is going on and

662
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:45,729
in time and if you think for a computer

663
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:48,788
is a computational path which is going

664
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:55,119
out in a huge dimensional space of ones

665
00:33:48,788 --> 00:33:56,739
and zeros and an error-correcting system

666
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:59,199
is a system which if you get a little

667
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:01,090
bit off that trajectory will push you

668
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,798
back onto that trajectory again till you

669
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:05,048
get to the same answer in spite of the

670
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,118
fact that there were things though that

671
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:11,139
the computation wasn't being ideally

672
00:34:07,118 --> 00:34:13,549
done all the way along a line and there

673
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,900
are lots of models for error correction

674
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,750
but one of the models for error

675
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,690
correction is to say there's a family

676
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,000
that you're following flowing down and

677
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,429
if you push a little bit off the valley

678
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,590
it's just like water being pushed a

679
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:31,119
little bit by a rock gets back and

680
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:36,829
follows the course of the river and then

681
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:38,449
basically the analog in the in the

682
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:42,259
physical system went to enable to just

683
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:44,719
say oh yes error free computation and an

684
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,000
associative memory are very much like

685
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,329
like things that I can understand from

686
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,269
the point of view of a physical system

687
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:58,250
the physical system is can be under some

688
00:34:53,269 --> 00:35:00,440
circumstances an accurate metaphor it's

689
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,630
not the only metaphor there are error

690
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,519
correction schemes which don't have a

691
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:09,200
valley and energy behind them but those

692
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,179
are correction schemes such a

693
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,439
mathematician may be able to understand

694
00:35:11,179 --> 00:35:18,230
but I don't so there's a the physical

695
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,000
metaphor that seems to a it seems to

696
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:25,340
work here that's right that's right so

697
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,250
these kinds of networks actually led to

698
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,260
a lot of the work that is going on now

699
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,269
and you're on that works artificial

700
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,940
neural network so the follow-on work

701
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:37,960
with restrictive Boltzmann machines and

702
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,849
deep belief Nets

703
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,679
followed on from the from these ideas of

704
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:46,880
the hopfield network so what what do you

705
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:50,799
think about this continued progress of

706
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,450
that work towards now ree-ree vigor ated

707
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,610
exploration of feed-forward neural

708
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:59,079
networks and recurrent neural networks

709
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:01,400
in convolutional neural networks and

710
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,170
kinds of networks that are helping solve

711
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,990
image recognition natural language

712
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,780
processing all that kind of stuff it's

713
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:09,019
always intrigued me one of the most

714
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,860
long-lived

715
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:15,469
all the learning systems is the

716
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:20,120
Boltzmann machine which is intrinsically

717
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:23,098
a feedback network and was the

718
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,710
brilliance of in

719
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,190
and Sadowski to understand how to do

720
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:30,929
learning in that and it's still a useful

721
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:34,048
way to understand learning and

722
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:35,788
understand and the learning that you

723
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,829
understand and that has something to do

724
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:41,579
with the way that feed-forward systems

725
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:47,278
work but it's not always exactly simple

726
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:49,920
to express that intuition but it always

727
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:52,409
amuses me as he Hinton going back to the

728
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,329
will yet again on a form of the

729
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:56,328
Boltzmann machine because really that

730
00:36:56,449 --> 00:37:02,748
which has feedback and interesting

731
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,499
probabilities in it this is a lovely

732
00:37:02,748 --> 00:37:09,439
encapsulation of something in

733
00:37:04,498 --> 00:37:11,578
computational something computational

734
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,519
something both computational and

735
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,880
physical computational and they very

736
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:20,459
much related to feed-forward networks

737
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,720
physical in that Boltzmann machine

738
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,880
learning is really learning a set of

739
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:30,358
parameters for physics Hamiltonian or

740
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,690
energy function what do you think about

741
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:37,650
learning in this whole domain do you do

742
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:41,009
you think the aforementioned guy Geoff

743
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,338
Hinton all the work there with

744
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:47,969
backpropagation all the kind of learning

745
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:50,909
that goes on in these networks how do

746
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:54,298
you if we compared to learning in the

747
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:57,828
brain for example is there echoes of the

748
00:37:54,298 --> 00:38:00,389
same kind of power that back propagation

749
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:02,460
reveals about these kinds of recurrent

750
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:04,558
networks or is it something

751
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:13,769
fundamentally different going on in the

752
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:17,930
brain I don't think the brain is as deep

753
00:38:13,768 --> 00:38:22,439
as the deepest networks go the deepest

754
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:24,058
computer science networks and I do

755
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,519
wonder where they're part of that depth

756
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,339
of the computer science networks is

757
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:33,639
necessitated by the fact that the only

758
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:36,909
learning is easily done on a machine is

759
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:39,730
his feed-forward and so there's the

760
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:42,940
question of to what extent as the

761
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:47,108
biology which has some feed-forward some

762
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:51,760
feedback been captured by something

763
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:53,730
which is it got many more neurons but

764
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,778
much more depth to the neurons

765
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:01,059
you know so party you wonders if the

766
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:03,789
feedback is actually more essential than

767
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:06,730
the number of neurons or the depth the

768
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:09,250
the dynamics of the feedback doesn't

769
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,949
ever have the feedback look if you don't

770
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,329
have if you don't have feedback it's a

771
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:15,879
little bit like a building a big

772
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:18,700
computer and having running up through

773
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:22,150
one clock cycle and then you can't do

774
00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:25,960
anything do you put you reload something

775
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:28,480
coming in how do you use the fact that

776
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,889
there are multiple clocks like how do I

777
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,409
use the fact that you can close your

778
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:34,598
eyes stop listening to me and think

779
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:40,268
about a chessboard for two minutes

780
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:43,690
without any input whatsoever yeah that

781
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:46,328
memory thing that's fundamentally a

782
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:50,679
feedback kind of mechanism you're going

783
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:52,359
back to something yes it's hard it's

784
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:58,149
hard it's hard to understand so I don't

785
00:39:52,358 --> 00:40:00,159
respect let alone consciousness oh is

786
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,559
that a little own consciousness yes

787
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:06,000
because that's tied up in there too you

788
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:08,619
can't just put that on another shelf

789
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,409
every once in a while like I interested

790
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:13,858
in consciousness and then I go and I've

791
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:17,618
done that for years and ask one of my

792
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:19,869
betters as it were their view on

793
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:26,230
consciousness there's been interest in

794
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:30,519
collecting them what let's try to take a

795
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:32,858
brief step into that room well that's

796
00:40:30,518 --> 00:40:36,028
Marvin Minsky does you want to

797
00:40:32,858 --> 00:40:39,509
consciousness and Marvin said

798
00:40:36,028 --> 00:40:44,079
consciousness is basically overrated

799
00:40:39,509 --> 00:40:46,240
it may be an epiphenomenon after all all

800
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,780
the things your brain does but your

801
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:56,169
as they're actually hard computations

802
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:58,359
you do not consciously and there's so

803
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,289
much evidence that even the things the

804
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:04,239
simple things you do you can make

805
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:06,309
decisions you can make committed

806
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,739
decisions about them the neurobiology

807
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:14,920
can say he's now committed he's going to

808
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:16,509
move the hand left before you know it so

809
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,700
his view that consciousness is not

810
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,320
that's just like little icing on the

811
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:24,250
cake the real cake is in the

812
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,960
subconscious yo-yo subconscious non

813
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,820
conscious non-conscious that's the

814
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,889
better word sir there's the it's only

815
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,720
the Freud captured the other word yeah

816
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:34,779
it's that's a confusing word

817
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:38,439
subconscious Nicholas Chater wrote an

818
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:46,960
interesting book I think the saw

819
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:48,970
delivers the mind is flat flat and in a

820
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,809
neural net sense you might have to be a

821
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:54,250
flat is something which is of very broad

822
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:57,009
they're all know without earlier than

823
00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:00,880
the layers in depth or as a deep brain

824
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:04,450
would be many layers and not so broad in

825
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,500
the same sense that if you push Minsky

826
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:10,569
hard enough he would talk V of said

827
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,750
consciousness is your effort to explain

828
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:19,480
to yourself that would you have already

829
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:21,519
done yeah it's the weaving of the

830
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,429
narrative around the things that already

831
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:27,759
been computed for you that's right and

832
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:31,868
then so much of what we do for our

833
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,140
memories of events for example if

834
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:37,329
there's some traumatic event you witness

835
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:40,358
you will have a few facts about it

836
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:42,699
correctly done if somebody asks you

837
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:45,159
about it you will weave a narrative

838
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:48,189
which is actually much more rich in

839
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,049
detail than that based on some anchor

840
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,260
points you have of correct things and

841
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,849
and pulling together general knowledge

842
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,550
on the other but you will have a

843
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:59,260
narrative and once you generate that

844
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,048
narrative if you are very likely to

845
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,849
repeat that

846
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:04,038
narrative and claim that all the things

847
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:04,640
you have hidden are actually the correct

848
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,949
things

849
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:15,498
there was a marvelous example of that in

850
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:18,999
the Watergate / impeachment era of John

851
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:23,688
Dean John Dean you're too young to know

852
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:28,098
had been the personal lawyer of Dickson

853
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:31,699
and so John Dean was involved in the

854
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:33,318
cover-up and John Dean ultimately

855
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:35,929
realized the only way to keep himself

856
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:38,028
out of jail for a long time was actually

857
00:43:35,929 --> 00:43:41,028
to tell some of the truths about Nixon

858
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:44,509
and John Dean was a tremendous witness

859
00:43:41,028 --> 00:43:47,978
he would remember these conversations in

860
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:52,759
great detail and very convincingly tail

861
00:43:47,978 --> 00:43:56,659
and long afterward some of the some of

862
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:59,269
the tapes the secret cases were for

863
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:02,659
which these Don was Jean was recalling

864
00:43:59,268 --> 00:44:05,118
these conversations were published and

865
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:07,548
one found out that John Dean had a good

866
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,999
but not exceptional memory what he had

867
00:44:07,548 --> 00:44:14,179
was an ability to paint vividly and in

868
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:17,568
some sense accurately the tone of what

869
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:20,010
was going on by the way that's a

870
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:22,420
beautiful description of consciousness

871
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:28,209
[Music]

872
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:34,009
do you mean like where do you stand in

873
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:36,318
your today so perhaps has changed his

874
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:38,269
day to day but where do you stand on the

875
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:42,858
importance of consciousness in our whole

876
00:44:38,268 --> 00:44:46,938
big mess of cognition is it just a

877
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:51,679
little narrative maker or is it actually

878
00:44:46,938 --> 00:44:56,629
fundamental to intelligence that's our

879
00:44:51,679 --> 00:45:00,709
that's a very hard one but I asked

880
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:03,499
Francis Crick about consciousness he

881
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:04,759
launched forward a long monologue about

882
00:45:03,498 --> 00:45:07,968
handling the peas

883
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:10,579
yeah and how Mendel knew that there was

884
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:12,608
something and how biologists understood

885
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:16,359
there was something in inherit

886
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:19,358
which was just very very different and

887
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:22,598
he is the effect that inherited traits

888
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:28,088
didn't just wash out into a grey but

889
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:29,859
it's this or this and propagated that

890
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:32,739
that was absolutely fundamentals of

891
00:45:29,858 --> 00:45:34,900
biology and it took generations of

892
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:37,509
biologists to understand that there was

893
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:40,210
genetic and it took another generation

894
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:44,680
or two to understand that genetics came

895
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:47,289
from DNA but there but but but very

896
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:48,759
shortly after Mendel thinking biologists

897
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:55,960
did realize that there was a deep

898
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:57,760
problem about inheritance any Francis

899
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,949
blood of life would like to have said

900
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,559
and that's why I'm we're working

901
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:04,689
unconsciousness but of course he didn't

902
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:09,880
have any smoking gun in the sense of

903
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:13,960
Mendel and that's the weakness of his

904
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,818
physician that he read his his book but

905
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,548
you wrote with Corey bank

906
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:21,358
yeah Christophe go on I find it

907
00:46:18,548 --> 00:46:28,719
unconvincing for this first poking gun

908
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:30,608
reason start going on and collecting

909
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,129
views without actually having taken a

910
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:35,949
very strong one myself because I haven't

911
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,289
seen the entry point not seeing the

912
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:40,409
smoking gun and the point of view of

913
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:42,970
physics I don't see the entry point

914
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:45,250
whereas whereas the neurobiology once

915
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:49,239
they understood the idea of a collective

916
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:51,130
a and evolution of dynamics which could

917
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:54,608
be described as a clock a collective

918
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:57,068
phenomenon I thought ah there's a point

919
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:59,230
where what I know about physics is so

920
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,548
different from any neurobiologist that I

921
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,849
have something that I might be able to

922
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:06,400
contribute and right now there's no way

923
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:09,010
to grasp at consciousness from a physics

924
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,470
perspective from my point of view that's

925
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:17,410
correct and of course people this is

926
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:19,868
like everybody else do you think very

927
00:47:17,409 --> 00:47:22,440
but early about things you have the

928
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:26,818
closely is related question about

929
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,818
freewill do you believe your freewill

930
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,960
physicists will give an offhand answer

931
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:33,969
and then backtrack backtrack backtrack

932
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,400
where they realized that the answer they

933
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:39,399
gave must fundamentally contradict the

934
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,019
laws of physics that natura answering

935
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,000
questions of freewill and consciousness

936
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:46,150
naturally lead to contradictions from a

937
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,409
physics perspective because it

938
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,420
eventually ends up with quantum

939
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:53,259
mechanics and then you get into that

940
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:56,920
whole mess of trying to understand how

941
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:59,830
much from a physics perspective how much

942
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,360
is determined already predetermined much

943
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:03,579
is already deterministic about our

944
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,070
universe there's lots of difference and

945
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:08,799
if you don't push quite that far you can

946
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:11,620
say essentially all of Neurobiology

947
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,480
which is relevant it can be captured by

948
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:18,219
classical equations of motion right

949
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,530
because in my view of the mysteries of

950
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:22,869
the brain are not the mysteries of

951
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,240
quantum mechanics for the mysteries of

952
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:29,259
what can happen when you have a

953
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:33,789
dynamical system driven system with 10

954
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:37,870
to the 14 parts the bare complexity is

955
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:40,659
something which is if the physical

956
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:43,809
complex systems is at least as badly

957
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:46,779
understood as the physics of phase

958
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:48,880
coherence and quantum mechanics can we

959
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:52,330
go there for a second you've talked

960
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,800
about attractor networks and just maybe

961
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,170
you could say what our attractor

962
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:59,200
networks and more broadly what are

963
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:05,380
interesting network dynamics that emerge

964
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:07,359
in these or other complex systems you

965
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,039
have to be willing to think in a huge

966
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,710
number of dimensions because there's a

967
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,389
huge number of dimensions the behavior

968
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,880
of a system can be thought of as just

969
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:18,420
the motion of the point over time in

970
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,610
those huge number of adventures right

971
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:25,119
and an attractor network is simply a

972
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:28,870
network where there is a line and other

973
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,359
lines converge on it in time that's the

974
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:34,059
essence of an attractor Network that's

975
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,890
how you need a highly highly dimensional

976
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:38,190
space

977
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:40,889
and the easiest way to get that is to do

978
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:44,099
it in a high dimensional space where

979
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:48,000
some of these dimensions provide the

980
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:51,860
dissipation which base which a kind of a

981
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,300
physical system trajectories can dig our

982
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:56,160
contract everywhere they have to get

983
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,860
tracked in some places and expand in

984
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,869
others there was a fundamental classical

985
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:02,910
theorem most statistical mechanics which

986
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:07,170
goes under the name of liouville's

987
00:50:02,909 --> 00:50:09,179
theorem which says you can't contract

988
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,670
everywhere after country if you contract

989
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:14,159
somewhere you were expand somewhere else

990
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:17,789
do you and is in interesting physical

991
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:20,309
systems you get driven systems where you

992
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:22,769
have a small subsystem which is the

993
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,150
interesting part and the rest of the

994
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:26,009
contraction of an expansion the

995
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:31,470
physicists say it's the entropy flow in

996
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:34,250
this other part of the system but but

997
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:39,029
basically attract your networks our

998
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:41,699
dynamics funneling downs of you can't be

999
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,170
any so if you start somewhere in the

1000
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,389
dynamical system you will soon find

1001
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,519
yourself on a pretty well determined

1002
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:48,779
pathway which goes somewhere you start

1003
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,509
somewhere else you'll wind up on a

1004
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,940
different pathway but you don't have

1005
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,430
just all possible things you have some

1006
00:50:53,940 --> 00:51:00,360
defined pathways which are allowed and

1007
00:50:56,429 --> 00:51:02,009
onto which you will converge and that's

1008
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,970
the way you make a stable computer and

1009
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:07,950
that's the way you make a stable

1010
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:11,969
behavior so in general looking at the

1011
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:15,989
physics of the emergent stability in

1012
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:19,799
these not--when networks what are some

1013
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:21,000
interesting characteristics that what

1014
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,370
are some interesting insights from

1015
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,340
studying the dynamics of such high

1016
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:28,710
dimensional systems most dynamical

1017
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,720
systems supposed I'm done driven

1018
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,849
dynamical systems I driven there are

1019
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,669
couples I'm out to an energy source and

1020
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:40,230
so their dynamics keeps going because

1021
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,849
it's coupling to the energy source most

1022
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,980
of them it's very difficult as all to

1023
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:46,789
understand it all with the devil

1024
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,469
the dynamical behavior is going to be

1025
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:52,349
you have to run it out you have to

1026
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:55,379
running there's this there's a subset of

1027
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:58,170
systems which has what was a clean tone

1028
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:02,220
to the mathematicians as as the Alpen of

1029
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:05,909
function and those systems you can

1030
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:08,368
understand convergent dynamics by saying

1031
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:12,838
you're going downhill on something or

1032
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:14,250
other and that's what I found without

1033
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:17,130
ever knowing what the alpha naught

1034
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:20,010
functions were in the simple model I

1035
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:21,960
made in the early eighties was an energy

1036
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,030
function so you could understand how you

1037
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,449
get this channeling I'm as under

1038
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:31,980
pathways without having to follow the

1039
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:33,929
dynamics in an infinite detail you

1040
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,070
started rolling a ball as off of a

1041
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:37,588
mountain that's gonna wind up at the

1042
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,710
bottom of a valley you know that it's

1043
00:52:37,588 --> 00:52:43,619
true without actually watching the ball

1044
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:46,949
fall roll down there's certain

1045
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:50,039
properties of the system that when you

1046
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:54,449
can know that that's right and not all

1047
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:56,730
systems behave that way most don't

1048
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:58,500
probably both don't but it provides you

1049
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:01,349
with the metaphor for thinking about

1050
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,500
systems which are stable in the whoo to

1051
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:07,349
have these attractors behave even if you

1052
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,119
can't find the idly up and a function

1053
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:13,400
behind them or an energy function behind

1054
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,400
them it gives you a metaphor for thought

1055
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:23,338
speaking of thought if I had a glint in

1056
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:25,618
my eye with excitement and said you know

1057
00:53:23,338 --> 00:53:27,659
I'm really excited about this something

1058
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:30,269
called deep learning and neural networks

1059
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:33,389
and I would like to create an

1060
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:38,449
intelligence system and came to you as

1061
00:53:33,389 --> 00:53:41,578
an adviser what would you recommend

1062
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:46,799
is it a hopeless pursuit she's knew all

1063
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:48,869
networks that she thought is it what

1064
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,410
kind of mechanism should we explore what

1065
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:56,700
kind of ideas should we explore well you

1066
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:57,259
look at this as the simple net worth for

1067
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:02,869
everyone

1068
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:08,300
networks they don't support multiple

1069
00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:10,309
hypotheses very well as I have tried to

1070
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,720
work with very simple systems which do

1071
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:14,090
something which you might consider to be

1072
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:17,779
thinking thought has to do with the

1073
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:21,490
ability to do mental exploration before

1074
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,490
you make it take a physical action

1075
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:27,920
almost they like we were mentioning

1076
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:30,019
playing chess visualizing simulating

1077
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:35,960
inside your head different outcomes

1078
00:54:30,019 --> 00:54:37,820
yellow young and now you could do that

1079
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,079
as a feed-forward Network because you've

1080
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:43,880
pre calculated all kinds of things but I

1081
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:49,610
think the way neurobiology does it

1082
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:52,220
hasn't pre calculated everything exactly

1083
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:56,780
as parts of a dynamical system in which

1084
00:54:52,219 --> 00:55:01,879
you're doing exploration in a way which

1085
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:03,470
is there's a creative element like

1086
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:08,200
there's an there's that there's there's

1087
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:15,579
a creative element and in a

1088
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:20,359
simple-minded neural net you ever a

1089
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:24,019
constellation of instances from which

1090
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:29,000
you've learned and if you are within

1091
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:30,800
that space you know if a new fan new

1092
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,739
question is the question within this

1093
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:38,120
space you can actually rely on that

1094
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:41,419
system pretty well to come up with a

1095
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:44,150
good suggestion for what to do if on the

1096
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:47,900
other hand the query comes from outside

1097
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:49,430
the space you have no way of knowing how

1098
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,300
the system is going to behave there are

1099
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:55,369
no limitations on what could happen and

1100
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:59,420
so with the artificial neural network is

1101
00:55:55,369 --> 00:56:02,839
always very much I have a a population

1102
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,940
of examples the test set must be drawn

1103
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,519
from the equivalent population as the

1104
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,318
test as examples which are from a

1105
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:13,650
population which is completely different

1106
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:15,748
there's no way that you could expect to

1107
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:19,660
get the answer right

1108
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:22,028
Meowth and so what they saw outside the

1109
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:25,449
distribution that's right that's right

1110
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:27,480
and so if you see a ball rolling across

1111
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:32,318
the streets and dusk

1112
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:35,108
if there wasn't in your your training

1113
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:37,869
set the idea that a child may be coming

1114
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:41,670
close behind that is not going to occur

1115
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:44,170
with the neural lab and it is to our

1116
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,630
there's something in your biology that

1117
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:48,369
allows that yeah there's there's

1118
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:52,329
something in the way of what it means to

1119
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:54,160
be outside of the of the population of

1120
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:56,499
the training said the probability is

1121
00:56:54,159 --> 00:57:01,929
that the training set isn't just sort of

1122
00:56:56,498 --> 00:57:04,889
the set of examples it's there's more to

1123
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:07,778
it than that and it gets back to my own

1124
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:13,568
question of where's is it to understand

1125
00:57:07,778 --> 00:57:15,969
something yeah you know is in a small

1126
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:18,130
tangent you've talked about the value of

1127
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:22,328
thinking of deductive reasoning in

1128
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:25,269
science versus large data collection so

1129
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:27,519
sort of thinking about the problem but I

1130
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:29,969
suppose it's the physics side of you of

1131
00:57:27,518 --> 00:57:31,868
going back to first principles and

1132
00:57:29,969 --> 00:57:34,028
thinking but what do you think is the

1133
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:37,140
value of deductive reasoning in in a

1134
00:57:34,028 --> 00:57:37,139
scientific process

1135
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:42,210
well look there obviously scientific

1136
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:44,460
questions in which the route to the

1137
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:48,710
answer to it come through the analysis

1138
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:48,710
of one hell of a lot of data right

1139
00:57:48,889 --> 00:57:56,429
cosmology at honest and that that's

1140
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:58,440
never written the kind of problem in

1141
00:57:56,429 --> 00:58:01,338
which I've had any particular insight

1142
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,409
though I would say if you look at

1143
00:58:01,338 --> 00:58:06,119
cosmology is was one of those if you

1144
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:07,920
look at the actual things that Jim

1145
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:10,588
Peebles one of this year's don't go

1146
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,720
prized for the vision physics ones from

1147
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:15,659
a local physics department the kinds of

1148
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:18,828
things he's done he's never crunched

1149
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:23,190
large data never never never

1150
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:28,079
he's used the encapsulation of the work

1151
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:31,139
of others in this regard but I

1152
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,789
ultimately boil down to thinking through

1153
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:34,798
the problem like what are the principles

1154
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:38,849
under which a particular phenomena

1155
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:40,500
operates yeah and look physics is always

1156
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:43,410
going to look for ways in which you can

1157
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:47,969
describe the system and which rises

1158
00:58:43,409 --> 00:58:53,328
above the rises above the details and to

1159
00:58:47,969 --> 00:58:56,250
the hard died the world biologists

1160
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:59,430
biology works because of the details and

1161
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:01,619
physics to the physicists we want an

1162
00:58:59,429 --> 00:59:03,629
explanation which is right in spite of

1163
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,670
the details and they will leave

1164
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:07,829
questions which we cannot answer as

1165
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:14,519
physicists because the answer cannot be

1166
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:16,890
found that way there's a met sure if

1167
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:20,389
you're familiar with the entire field of

1168
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:24,088
brain-computer interfaces has become

1169
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:25,469
more and more intensely researched and

1170
00:59:24,088 --> 00:59:27,599
developed recently especially with

1171
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:30,268
companies like neural link what Elon

1172
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,890
Musk you know I know they've always been

1173
00:59:30,268 --> 00:59:38,008
the endres both in things like getting

1174
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:41,129
the eyes to be able to control things or

1175
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:44,818
getting the thought patterns to be able

1176
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:46,769
to move what had been a they connected

1177
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:50,670
limb which is now connected through a

1178
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:51,000
computer that's right so in the case of

1179
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,450
neural

1180
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,239
they're doing thousand-plus connections

1181
00:59:54,449 --> 01:00:00,359
where they're able to do two-way

1182
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:02,969
activate and read spikes in your annual

1183
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,750
spikes do you have hope for that kind of

1184
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:10,709
computer brain interaction in the near

1185
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:14,480
or maybe even far future of being able

1186
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:20,789
to expand the ability of the mind of

1187
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:24,300
cognition or understand the mind as this

1188
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:27,269
was watching things go when I first

1189
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:28,980
became interested in neurobiology most

1190
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:31,769
of the practitioners thought you would

1191
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,769
be able to understand neurobiology by

1192
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:37,860
techniques which allowed you to record

1193
01:00:34,769 --> 01:00:44,039
only one cell at a time once out yeah

1194
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:47,460
people like David Hoople very strongly

1195
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:50,880
reflected that point of view and that's

1196
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,440
been taken over by a generation a couple

1197
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,079
of generations later

1198
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,510
a set of people who says not until we

1199
01:00:55,079 --> 01:01:00,299
can record from 10 to the 4 or 10 to the

1200
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:01,830
5 at a time who we actually be able to

1201
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:07,950
understand how the brain actually works

1202
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:10,319
and in a general sense I think that's

1203
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:14,480
right you have to look you have to begin

1204
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:17,430
to be able to look for the collective

1205
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,829
modes of the collective operations of

1206
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:21,809
things it doesn't rely on this action

1207
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:23,579
potential or death cell it relies on the

1208
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:25,920
collective properties of this set of

1209
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:29,519
cells connected to this kind of patterns

1210
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,780
so on and you're not going to see did

1211
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,210
the thing what those collective

1212
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:39,060
activities are without recording many

1213
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:41,369
cells at once and the question is how

1214
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:46,019
many at once what's the threshold and

1215
01:01:41,369 --> 01:01:48,329
that's the that's the no and and because

1216
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:52,980
we pursued hard in the motor cortex the

1217
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:54,869
motor cortex does something which is

1218
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,639
complex and yet with the problem you're

1219
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:58,940
trying to address is very it's really

1220
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,940
simple

1221
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,909
now neurobiology does it in ways the

1222
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:07,920
different from the way an engineer would

1223
01:02:03,909 --> 01:02:10,210
do it an engineer would put in six

1224
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,780
highly accurate stepping motors are

1225
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:15,940
controlling a limb rather than 2,000

1226
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:21,310
muscle fibers each of which has to be

1227
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:23,409
individually controlled so understanding

1228
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:26,070
how to do things in a way which is much

1229
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:30,009
more forgiving and much more neural I

1230
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:36,100
think would benefit the engineering

1231
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:37,930
world the engineering world touch that's

1232
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:40,750
where their pressure sensor or to let

1233
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:43,179
very them an array of of a gazillion

1234
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:44,679
pressure pressure sensors none of what

1235
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:49,000
you're accurate all of which are

1236
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:51,279
perpetually recalibrating themselves so

1237
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,889
you're saying your hope is your advice

1238
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:59,100
for the engineers of the future is to

1239
01:02:53,889 --> 01:03:01,629
the embrace the large chaos of a messy

1240
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:04,179
error-prone system like those of the

1241
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:06,190
biological systems like that's probably

1242
01:03:04,179 --> 01:03:09,819
the way to solve some of these I think

1243
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:13,360
you'll be able to make better compete

1244
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:18,850
computations last robotics that way than

1245
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:22,210
by trying to force things into a into a

1246
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:25,480
robotics for joint motors are powerful

1247
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:27,670
and stepping motors are accurate but

1248
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,420
then the physicists the physicists in

1249
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:33,070
you will be lost forever in such systems

1250
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,639
because there's no simple fundamentals

1251
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:42,039
to exploring systems that are so large

1252
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:44,679
and we also you see that yep there's a

1253
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:48,340
lot of physics and the navier-stokes

1254
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:50,829
equations the equations of nonlinear

1255
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:53,710
hydrodynamics huge amount of physics in

1256
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:55,869
them all the physics of atoms and

1257
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:58,150
molecules has been lost but it's been

1258
01:03:55,869 --> 01:04:00,639
replaced or this other set of equations

1259
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:03,579
which is just as true as the equations

1260
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:05,889
of the bottle though those those

1261
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:09,789
equations are going to be harder to find

1262
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:11,710
in general biology but the physicist of

1263
01:04:09,789 --> 01:04:12,820
me says there are probably some

1264
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,010
equations of there

1265
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,530
sort they're out there there they're out

1266
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:20,710
there and the physics is going to

1267
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:22,990
contribute anything it may contribute to

1268
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:24,699
trying to find out what those equations

1269
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:27,879
are and how to capture them from them

1270
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:31,449
biology would you say that's one of the

1271
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:35,050
main open problems of our age is to

1272
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:38,049
discover those equations yeah if you

1273
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:44,080
look at theirs molecules

1274
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:45,460
there's psychological behavior these two

1275
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,360
are somehow related

1276
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:51,670
there are layers of detail they're

1277
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:56,340
layers of collectiveness and to capture

1278
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:56,340
this to capture that at some vague wait

1279
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:02,409
several stages on the way up to see how

1280
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:05,559
these things that can actually be linked

1281
01:05:02,409 --> 01:05:08,889
together so it seems in our universe

1282
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:10,269
there's a lot of a lot of elegant

1283
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:12,609
equations that can describe the

1284
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:14,920
fundamental way that things behave which

1285
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:17,550
is a surprise I mean it's compressible

1286
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,289
into equations it's simple and beautiful

1287
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:23,230
but there isn't it's still an open

1288
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:27,329
question whether that link is equally

1289
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:30,159
between molecules and the brain is

1290
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:34,809
equally compressible into elegant

1291
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:36,819
equations but your ear sounds some well

1292
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:39,159
you're both a physicist and a dreamer

1293
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:42,730
you have a sense that yes I can although

1294
01:05:39,159 --> 01:05:45,039
I can only dream physics dreams physics

1295
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,559
shapes there was an interesting book

1296
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:53,340
called Einsteins dreams Forge alternates

1297
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:56,469
between chapters on his life and

1298
01:05:53,340 --> 01:06:02,350
descriptions of the way time might have

1299
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:05,199
been but isn't as linking between these

1300
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:06,519
being of course the ideas that Einstein

1301
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,589
might have had to think about the

1302
01:06:06,519 --> 01:06:12,849
essence of time as he was thinking about

1303
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:17,440
time so speaking of the essence of time

1304
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:19,750
in neurobiology you're one human famous

1305
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,519
impactful human but just one human with

1306
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:26,730
a brain living the human condition

1307
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:29,809
but you're ultimately mortal like all of

1308
01:06:26,730 --> 01:06:32,340
us has studying the mind as a mechanism

1309
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:39,980
change the way you think about your own

1310
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:42,090
mortality it has really because as

1311
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:46,610
particularly as you get older in the

1312
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:52,350
body comes apart in various ways I

1313
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:56,400
became much more aware of the fact that

1314
01:06:52,349 --> 01:07:00,360
what is somebody is contained in the

1315
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:05,940
brain and out in the body that you worry

1316
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:09,390
about burying and it is to a certain

1317
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:14,869
extent true that for people who write

1318
01:07:09,389 --> 01:07:20,219
things down equations dreams notepads

1319
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:23,340
Diaries fractions of their thought does

1320
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:25,379
continue to live after they're dead and

1321
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:30,329
gone after their body is dead and gone

1322
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:35,099
and there's a sea change in there going

1323
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:37,079
on in my lifetime between what if my

1324
01:07:35,099 --> 01:07:39,000
father died when except for the things

1325
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,179
that you're actually ridden by hymns

1326
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,639
that were very few facts about him will

1327
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:46,349
have ever been recorded and the number

1328
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:50,250
of facts which are recorded about each

1329
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:54,569
and every one of us forever now as far

1330
01:07:50,250 --> 01:08:01,380
as I can see in the digital world and so

1331
01:07:54,570 --> 01:08:03,720
the whole question of what is death may

1332
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:06,590
be different for people a generation to

1333
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:09,719
go in a generation or through ahead

1334
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:16,460
maybe we have become immortal under some

1335
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:24,239
definitions yeah yeah last easy question

1336
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:30,630
what is the meaning of life looking back

1337
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:33,389
studied the mind a weird descendants of

1338
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:40,590
apes what's the meaning of our existence

1339
01:08:33,390 --> 01:08:45,440
on this little earth Oh word meeting is

1340
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:45,440
as slippery as the word understand

1341
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:56,600
interconnected somehow perhaps is there

1342
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:59,099
it's slippery but is there something you

1343
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:03,960
despite being slippery can hold long

1344
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:10,470
enough to express all I've been amazed

1345
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:15,409
at how hard it is to define the things

1346
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:18,119
in a living system in the sense that

1347
01:09:15,409 --> 01:09:18,680
what a hydrogen atom is pretty much like

1348
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:21,239
another

1349
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:24,570
one bacterium is not so much like

1350
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:27,059
another like another bacterium even of

1351
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:29,009
the same nominal species in fact the

1352
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:32,730
whole notion of what as the species gets

1353
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:34,650
a little bit fuzzy and do species exists

1354
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:37,379
in the absence of certain classes of

1355
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:41,609
environments and pretty soon one winds

1356
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:44,010
up with with the biology which the whole

1357
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:47,759
thing is living but whether there's

1358
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:51,300
actually any element of it which by

1359
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:55,710
itself would be said to be living is

1360
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:58,260
becomes a little bit vague in my mind so

1361
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:59,789
in a sense the idea of meaning is

1362
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:03,210
something that's possessed by an

1363
01:09:59,789 --> 01:10:06,390
individual like a conscious creature and

1364
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:08,250
you're saying that it's all

1365
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,440
interconnected in some kind of way that

1366
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:13,949
there might not even be an individual

1367
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,750
we're all kind of this complicated mess

1368
01:10:13,949 --> 01:10:18,989
of biological systems at all different

1369
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:21,989
levels where the human starts and when

1370
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:25,289
the human ends is unclear you know yeah

1371
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:27,479
and we're the neurobiology where the oh

1372
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:29,039
you say that the your cortex does the

1373
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:32,069
thinking but there's lots of things that

1374
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:35,970
are done in the spinal cord and so we

1375
01:10:32,069 --> 01:10:37,649
say where's the essence of thought it's

1376
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:42,449
just going to be neocortex

1377
01:10:37,649 --> 01:10:43,948
can't be campy yeah maybe to understand

1378
01:10:42,448 --> 01:10:46,198
and to build thought you have to build

1379
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:49,769
the universe along with the the

1380
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:53,309
neocortex it's all interlinked through

1381
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:55,409
the spinal cord John is a huge honor

1382
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,800
talking today thank you so much for your

1383
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:57,599

1384
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,039
I really appreciate it well thank you

1385
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,630
for the challenge of talking with you

1386
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:03,269
and the interesting to see whether you

1387
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:06,230
can win a 5 in 5 minutes out of that

1388
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:09,120
just coherent sense to anywhere

1389
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:10,948
beautiful thanks for listening to this

Friedman and now let me leave you with

1402
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:44,760
some words of wisdom from john hopfield

1403
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:47,219
in his article titled now what choosing

1404
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,280
problems is the primary determinant of

1405
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:52,109
what one accomplishes in science i have

1406
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,630
generally had a relatively short

1407
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:56,819
attention span and science problems thus

1408
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:59,130
i have always been on the lookout for

1409
01:11:56,819 --> 01:12:01,920
more interesting questions either as my

1410
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:04,590
present ones get worked out or as it get

1411
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:07,980
classified by me as intractable give him

1412
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:11,130
my particular talents he then goes on to

1413
01:12:07,979 --> 01:12:13,109
say what I have done in science relies

1414
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:16,319
entirely on experimental and theoretical

1415
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:18,420
studies by experts I have a great

1416
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,880
respect for them especially for those

1417
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,158
who are willing to attempt communication

1418
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:26,730
with soin who is not an expert in the

1419
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:29,279
field I would only add that experts are

1420
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:33,169
good at answering questions if you're

1421
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:36,408
brash enough ask your own

1422
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:38,239
too much about how you found them

1423
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:41,018
for listening and hope to see you next

1424
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:41,018
time

1425
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,530
you
