1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,559
well

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,559
the short talk is this

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,599
I did a lot of math

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,540
I made a lot of money

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,140
and I gave almost all of it away

6
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,379
that's the story of my life now

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,820
it's a good story but it's short

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,460
so

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,179
when I was a little boy

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,820
I uh I liked math in the sense that I

11
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,558
like to when I was three or four or

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,399
something like that double the numbers

13
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,238
to 4 8 16 32 episode

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,660
Etc

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:46,979
I got up to a thousand and twenty four

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:49,439
and I said enough of that but uh but I I

17
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:52,378
like doubling numbers

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,238
and uh

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:01:00,238
when I was a little boy also

20
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:03,780
I was in my father's my father was

21
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:07,560
driving me and he said he has to

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,960
go to a gas station and get gasoline I

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,978
said why do you need to get gasoline he

24
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,618
says well

25
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,140
a car needs gasoline I said but you

26
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,780
shouldn't need to have to get gasoline

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,259
you could just use half of what you now

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,000
have and then half of that and half of

29
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,519
that and half of that and you'll never

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,459
run out of gas

31
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,359
without what's called Zeno's Paradox but

32
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,399
uh

33
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,118
because it didn't occur to me that we

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
wouldn't get very far either but uh

35
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:44,219
there there it was

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,560
but I did always always like math and uh

37
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,420
I went to MIT

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,359
and uh

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,978
I took a graduate course right in my

40
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,859
freshman year

41
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:57,658
which uh was puzzling to me it was

42
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,359
abstract algebra

43
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,880
but during this

44
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:06,840
summer I figured it all out I got a book

45
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,459
I figured it all out and and then took a

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,219
lot of math courses

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,180
at MIT

48
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,699
um

49
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,620
and uh

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:23,039
well the field that I really liked

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,959
was called differential geometry

52
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,159
how many of you have ever heard of

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,159
differential geometry

54
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,500
okay

55
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,019
the old folks know about different

56
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,580
geometry well differential geometry is a

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,560
study of curved spaces in in many

58
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,560
dimensions

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,080
with typically with a metric on it so

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,459
you can see how far apart any two points

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,599
would would be

62
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,939
and uh I really like that field

63
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,500
and well

64
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:59,098
um

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,840
I went to Berkeley

66
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:05,878
I forgot my well I I graduated MIT in

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
three years so I stayed as a graduate

68
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,579
student

69
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,459
for a year

70
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,400
and then they told me

71
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,019
you should go to Berkeley and I said why

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,539
why should I go to Berkeley they said

73
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,759
well the great man in your field

74
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:23,098
differential geometry

75
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,560
a man named chern

76
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,439
is just going to Berkeley

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,300
and you should work under churn

78
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:35,280
so I said okay so I went out to Berkeley

79
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,640
regrettably uh churn

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,519
was taking a sabbatical leave that year

81
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,378
and so he wasn't there so I worked with

82
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,658
someone else and that that worked out

83
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,818
fine

84
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:50,598
uh it was interesting

85
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:53,219
uh working with this guy

86
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,658
I came up with a little theorem and I

87
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:57,419
showed it to him

88
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,439
and he said oh that's a nice little

89
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,419
theorem

90
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,719
it puts in mind

91
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,000
an open question which I won't

92
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:09,180
really describe to you

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,799
but uh but don't work on that question I

94
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,719
said why he said because it's too tough

95
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,759
this this one worked on it and tried and

96
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,459
that one worked on it and tried

97
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,240
well of course that just sort of got me

98
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:29,160
going and uh I said okay but I I'm going

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,100
to work in this problem and uh well uh

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,699
I did and I solved the problem

101
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,979
and I was very pleased with myself

102
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,720
and uh

103
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:47,219
went back to teach at MIT and Harvard

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,000
but for reasons which I won't go into

105
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,900
I uh I needed money

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,279
and I had borrowed money to invest in a

107
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:02,698
company with some friends of mine

108
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:05,279
and I need needed to pay it back

109
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,620
but there was a place in Princeton

110
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,779
called The Institute for defense

111
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,780
analyzes

112
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:15,258
which was a highly

113
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:19,859
classified place

114
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:22,800
under the Aegis of the government the

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,180
defense department and what we're

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,439
supposed to do

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,620
is uh break Russian codes

118
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,478
well that was an interesting challenge

119
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,120
uh

120
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,379
I like the work

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,538
they told us you could do your own

122
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:45,060
mathematics up to half your time the

123
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:47,339
other half you had to do you know this

124
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,579
cold cracking business

125
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,560
and well uh

126
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:56,279
during that period

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:00,660
I was very interested in an area of

128
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:02,638
mathematics called minimal surfaces does

129
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,880
any of you know what a minimal surface

130
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,879
is

131
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,800
well someone must know what a minimal

132
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,279
surface is okay so a minimal surface is

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,379
a surface of minimal area with respect

134
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,179
to its boundary

135
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:22,439
so imagine taking a wire frame just a

136
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,879
closed frame

137
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,418
dip it in

138
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,159
so in in so soap suds

139
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:31,219
and then take it out

140
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,639
and there'll be a film

141
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,979
that is bounded by this thing and that

142
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,360
film that soap film

143
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:45,120
has less an area than any other surface

144
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,560
with that boundary so that's a minimal

145
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,319
that's a minimal surface and uh

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:57,000
the first Fields Prize winner

147
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:02,100
uh back in maybe 1905

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,740
had proved that any such boundary

149
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,520
would have

150
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,439
a minimal surface just one and it would

151
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,000
be smooth it wouldn't have any points or

152
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,038
anything like that it would just be a

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,740
nice smooth surface

154
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:17,639
and as I said he won the fields medal

155
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,019
for that

156
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:25,860
and um so I got interested in that area

157
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:28,139
while I was there at uh at The Institute

158
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,500
for defense analyzes

159
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,819
so in my spare time which was

160
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,098
quite a lot I worked on that problem

161
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,139
because in higher dimensions

162
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:42,659
it was an open was an open problem

163
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,418
someone had done it in one dimension

164
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,720
higher

165
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:51,478
uh so that would be uh a a

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,880
three-dimensional

167
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,879
surface with a two-dimensional boundary

168
00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,120
in four-dimensional space

169
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,439
and uh well uh but that's where it

170
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,598
stopped

171
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,279
so I worked in that problem in higher

172
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,860
dimensions and

173
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,619
was uh lucky enough

174
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,520
to solve the problem

175
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:18,899
through ambient Dimension seven

176
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:21,959
but in dimension eight

177
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:25,378
my proof didn't work

178
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:28,439
and uh and I constructed what I thought

179
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,360
was a counter example a counter example

180
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:33,538
was something that uh

181
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,099
you you you think you have a

182
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,620
you've proved the theorem but someone

183
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,539
comes along with an example that shows

184
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,639
you didn't prove that theorem because

185
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:47,278
this is a counter example so uh I found

186
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,778
what I thought was a counter example I

187
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,899
couldn't prove it

188
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,458
but a couple years and I the paper got

189
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:56,100
published it was

190
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:58,139
was a pretty good paper actually

191
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,120
and um

192
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,278
but a few years later

193
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,320
a couple of mathematicians one of whom

194
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:07,559
was named bombieri

195
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,500
and uh showed that my counter example

196
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:14,219
was really a counter example so that

197
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,220
killed the problem altogether

198
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:21,660
well uh at a certain point

199
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,360
I came to

200
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,039
Stony Brook University I was 30 years

201
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,740
old

202
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:31,379
to be the chair

203
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,200
of their math department

204
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,240
which was not a very strong Department

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,019
and I was pretty young to be the

206
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,879
chairman but I thought it would be fun

207
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,820
and I had a lot of money to work with

208
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,620
because

209
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,660
the governor at the time was a guy named

210
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,720
Rockefeller now I think everyone has

211
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:54,778
probably heard of the name Rockefeller

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,459
but has anyone not heard of the name

213
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:59,059
Rockefeller

214
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,259
okay most of you have heard of

215
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,719
Rockefeller Rockefeller love the State

216
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,059
University and was pouring money on it

217
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,920
so I had a lot of money to work with

218
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,039
and uh

219
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,919
hired some terrific people so

220
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:18,480
high as I'm terrific people

221
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:20,939
but at the same time in that time frame

222
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,379
I started to get interested in another

223
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,380
area of math

224
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,299
and uh

225
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:33,419
I worked on that area

226
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,979
and came up with something really quite

227
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:38,278
beautiful

228
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,920
three dimensions it was a function I

229
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:43,919
can't really describe it but it

230
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,360
it lived in three dimensions closed

231
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,278
three-dimensional

232
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,800
spaces

233
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,860
and I

234
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:55,500
was quite pleased

235
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,519
I showed it to churn

236
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,919
I I say I showed it I we I centered by

237
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,600
the mail because her nose days there was

238
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,899
no email

239
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,220
and chern said well you've done this in

240
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,179
three dimensions

241
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,420
but it should work in all dimensions

242
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:17,338
I was very dubious but I said okay let's

243
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,019
work together and see

244
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,779
and he was right

245
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,539
it would work in all dimensions

246
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,720
and I was very pleased we published the

247
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:26,719
paper

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,220
and about five years later

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,039
a physicist

250
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,800
named Whitten

251
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,860
saw this paper and thought and he was

252
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,859
right it could apply to physics

253
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,360
and then some other physicists saw how

254
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,360
it could apply to physics

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,240
I didn't know any physics at all

256
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,680
churn might have known something but it

257
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,180
never occurred to him that would apply

258
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,958
to physics

259
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:03,059
and remarkably so you never know where

260
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,759
something will go

261
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:09,838
you think you're doing math and you're

262
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:12,659
actually doing physics maybe or whatever

263
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,820
so today

264
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:19,259
that is

265
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:23,100
called churn Simon's Theory

266
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,039
it's all over the place in physics

267
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,339
on average every day

268
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,500
four papers in physics

269
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,959
reference this

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,458
churn Simon's Theory

271
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:41,159
so I can't take any credit for it at all

272
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:43,799
but but there it was and of course

273
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:46,679
I'm quite pleased about it but I can't

274
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,039
say that oh I I invented this for

275
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,039
physics

276
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,680
well

277
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,339
shortly after that

278
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,919
I started to get interested

279
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,320
in the world of Investments

280
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:03,958
I had come into

281
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,720
a very small amount of money but it was

282
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,539
enough to start investing

283
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,379
and one thing led to another

284
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:17,338
I started hiring people

285
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:19,338
and we made what was called a hedge fund

286
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,620
and it was

287
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:26,339
remarkably successful

288
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,440
it's still going I'm not with it anymore

289
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,779
but I made

290
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,459
a tremendous amount of money

291
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:39,480
from this from this hedge fund

292
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:41,879
now my lovely wife Marilyn

293
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,639
said let's give some of it away

294
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,078
so I said okay fine so we gave some

295
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,700
charity

296
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,679
and then she said well why don't we

297
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,759
start a foundation

298
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:55,679
and uh okay starting Foundation she

299
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,379
started a foundation

300
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,059
I put money into it

301
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,860
the good thing about putting money into

302
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:05,099
a foundation is you can give the money

303
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,560
away you've got the tax advantage but it

304
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,000
doesn't have to be spent immediately so

305
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,500
you can put money into the foundation

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,899
and say well we'll see what we want to

307
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,039
do with it tomorrow or next year or

308
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,519
whatever

309
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:19,799
but it grew and grew

310
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,860
and grew

311
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,679
so uh

312
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,360
it today

313
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,500
oh well

314
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:35,519
we decided to focus on science

315
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,799
with our uh Foundation

316
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,820
focus on science

317
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:46,439
uh ninety percent of it should be

318
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,519
science 8 60 of that should be basic

319
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,579
science

320
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
and 30 of that could be translational

321
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,019
science

322
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,599
and 10 could be education and Outreach

323
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,120
and things like that

324
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,778
so today uh

325
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:06,360
that Foundation is

326
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:09,980
extremely large

327
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,079
and uh so most of the money that I made

328
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:18,240
was put into the foundation

329
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:20,159
so I'm not so rich as I was before but

330
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,579
uh Rich enough

331
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,319
and we had this wonderful Foundation

332
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:27,719
and uh

333
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,879
running it most of the time was my

334
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,660
wonderful wife

335
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,659
any questions

336
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,720
no questions

337
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,899
yeah Yuri is in the foundation he just

338
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,620
talked

339
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,620
uh

340
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:53,459
that's a very good question

341
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,419
I could go into that but it's a long

342
00:15:53,458 --> 00:16:00,419
story so so I won't

343
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:02,959
any other questions

344
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:08,658
okay good luck to all of you

345
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,658
[Applause]
