1
00:00:00,248 --> 00:00:01,730
- You know I can tell ChatGPT,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,233
create a piece of code and then
just run it on my computer.

3
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:06,670
And I'm like, you know, that,

4
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,400
that sort of personalizes
for me the what could,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,599
what could possibly go wrong, so to speak.

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,679
- Was that exciting or
scary, that possibility?

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,024
- [Wolfram] It was a
little bit scary actually,

8
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:18,402
because it's kind of like,
if you do that right,

9
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,664
What is the sandboxing
that you should have?

10
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:22,984
And that's sort of a,
that's a, a version of,

11
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,865
of that question for the world.

12
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:27,545
That is, as soon as you put
the AIs in charge of things,

13
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:30,457
you know, how much, how many
constraints should there be

14
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:33,481
on these systems before
you put the AIs in charge

15
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,904
of all the weapons and all these,

16
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,785
you know, all these
different kinds of systems.

17
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:39,343
- Well here's the fun
part about sandboxes,

18
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:44,261
is the AI knows about them and
has the tools to crack them.

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,456
The following is a conversation
with Steven Wolfram,

20
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,527
his fourth time on this podcast.

21
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:53,480
He's a computer scientist, mathematician,

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,039
theoretical physicist, and the
founder of Wolfram Research,

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,241
a company behind
Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha,

24
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,535
Wolfram Language and the Wolfram physics

25
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:05,103
and meta mathematics projects.

26
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:08,081
He has been a pioneer in exploring

27
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,129
the computational nature of reality.

28
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:14,050
And so he's the perfect person
to explore with together

29
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,042
the new quickly evolving
landscape of large language models

30
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,391
as human civilization
journeys towards building

31
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:22,224
super intelligent AGI.

32
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,926
This is a Lex Fridman podcast.

33
00:01:25,927 --> 00:01:26,856
To support it,

34
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:29,063
Please check out our
sponsors in the description.

35
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:33,480
And now, dear friends
here's Stephen Wolfram.

36
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,218
You've announced the
integration of ChatGPT

37
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,800
and Wolfram Alpha and Wolfram Language.

38
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,031
So let's talk about that integration.

39
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,896
What are the key differences

40
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:45,265
from the high philosophical level,

41
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:49,930
maybe the technical level
between the capabilities of,

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,664
broadly speaking, the
two kinds of systems,

43
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:53,137
large language models,

44
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:55,890
and this computational
gigantic computational system

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,594
infrastructure that is Wolfram Alpha?

46
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:00,745
- Yeah. So what does
something like ChatGPT do?

47
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,488
It's, it's mostly
focused on make language,

48
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:07,273
like the language that humans have made

49
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,000
and put on the web and so on.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,275
Yeah, so, you know, it's,

51
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:14,074
it's primary sort of
underlying technical thing

52
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:16,027
is you've given a prompt,

53
00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:18,018
it's trying to continue
that prompt in a way

54
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,128
that's somehow typical of what it's seen

55
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,440
based on a trillion words of text

56
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,250
that humans have written on the web.

57
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,018
And the way it's doing
that is with something

58
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:31,907
which is probably quite
similar to the way we humans

59
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,874
do the first stages of that,

60
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:35,568
using a neural net and so on,

61
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:39,833
and just saying, given these,
given this piece of text,

62
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:42,906
let's ripple through the
neural net one word and,

63
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,426
and get one word at a time of output.

64
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,473
And it's kind of a, a shallow computation

65
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:51,456
on a large amount of kind of training data

66
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,104
that is what we humans
have put on the web.

67
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,008
That's a different thing from
sort of the computational

68
00:02:57,008 --> 00:02:59,521
stack that I've spent
the last, I don't know,

69
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:00,823
40 years or so building,

70
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:04,826
which has to do with what
can you compute many steps,

71
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:07,042
potentially a very deep computation.

72
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:09,856
It's not sort of taking the statistics

73
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,199
of what we humans have produced

74
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,337
and trying to continue things
based on that statistics.

75
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:19,399
Instead, it's trying to take
kind of the formal structure

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,497
that we've created in our civilization,

77
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,632
whether it's from mathematics,
or whether it's from

78
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:26,848
kind of systematic knowledge of all kinds,

79
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,937
and use that to do
arbitrarily deep computations

80
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,217
to figure out things
that, that aren't just,

81
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:37,752
let's match what's already
been kind of said on the web,

82
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,513
but let's potentially be
able to compute something new

83
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:42,800
and different that's never
been computed before.

84
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,840
So as a, as a practical matter, you know,

85
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,176
the, the what we're, you know, the,

86
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:50,656
our goal is to have made as
much as possible of the world

87
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:54,010
computable in the sense
that if there's a question

88
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,643
that in principle is answerable

89
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:58,266
from some sort of expert
knowledge that's been accumulated,

90
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:01,825
we can compute the
answer to that question,

91
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,070
and we can do it in a sort
of reliable way that's,

92
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,121
that's the best one can do,
given what the expertise

93
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:10,408
that our civilization has accumulated.

94
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,871
It's a very, it's a,
it's a much more sort of

95
00:04:12,872 --> 00:04:16,439
labor intensive on the
side of kind of being,

96
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,761
creating kind of the, the
computational system to do that.

97
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:24,387
Obviously the in, in the, the
kind of the ChatGPT world,

98
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:27,259
it's like take things which were produced

99
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,466
for quite other purposes,

100
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:31,225
namely the all the things
we've written out on the web

101
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:35,400
and so on, and sort of forage
from that things which were,

102
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,665
are like what's been written on the web.

103
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,656
So I think, you know, as a,
as a practical point of view,

104
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:43,399
I view sort of the ChatGPT
thing as being wide

105
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,262
and shallow and what
we're trying to do with

106
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:50,822
sort of building out computation
as being this sort of deep,

107
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,724
also broad, but, but most importantly

108
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:56,038
kind of deep type of thing.

109
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,485
I think another way to
think about this is,

110
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,259
if you go back in human
history, you know, I don't know,

111
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,052
a thousand years or something,

112
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,663
and you say, what, what,
what can the typical person,

113
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,198
what's the typical person
going to figure out?

114
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,556
Well, the answer is there's
certain kinds of things

115
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:11,701
that we humans can quickly figure out.

116
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,591
That's sort of what, what our, you know,

117
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,973
other neural architecture
and the kinds of things

118
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,966
we learn in our lives let us do.

119
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:23,110
But then there's this whole
layer of kind of formalization

120
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,518
that got developed in which is, you know,

121
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:28,988
the kind of whole sort of
story of intellectual history

122
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:31,445
and the whole kind of depth of learning

123
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,703
that formalization turned
into things like logic,

124
00:05:33,702 --> 00:05:36,702
mathematics, science and so on.

125
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:38,622
And that's the kind of
thing that allows one

126
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:42,125
to kind of build these towers of, of, of,

127
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,372
of sort of towers of things you work out.

128
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,221
It's not just, I can immediately
figure this out, it's no,

129
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:52,020
I can use this kind of
formalism to go step by step

130
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,614
and work out something which was not

131
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,334
immediately obvious to me.

132
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,790
And that's kind of the story of what,

133
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,278
what we're trying to do computationally,

134
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:01,387
is to be able to build
those kind of tall towers

135
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:04,252
of what implies, what
implies what and so on.

136
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,502
And as opposed to kind of the yes,

137
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,612
I can immediately figure it out,

138
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,661
it's just like what I saw
somewhere else in something

139
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,189
that I heard or remembered
or something like this.

140
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:17,503
- What can you say about
the kind of formal structure

141
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,199
or the kind of formal
foundation you can build

142
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,564
such a formal structure on
about the kinds of things

143
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:25,548
you would start on in order to build

144
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:29,298
this kind of deep
computable knowledge trees.

145
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,589
- So the question is sort of how do you,

146
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:34,917
how do you think about
computation and there's,

147
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,317
there's a couple of points here.

148
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:40,397
One is what computation
intrinsically is like,

149
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:43,558
and the other is what
aspects of computation

150
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:46,269
we humans with our minds
and with the kinds of things

151
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:48,948
we've learned can sort of relate to

152
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,365
in that computational universe.

153
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:52,556
So if we start on the kind of,

154
00:06:52,557 --> 00:06:55,133
what can computation be like,

155
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:58,430
it's something I've spent some
big chunk of my life studying

156
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,502
is imagine that you are,
you know, we, we usually,

157
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:02,963
we write programs where we kind of know

158
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,766
what we want the program to do

159
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:07,348
and we carefully write, you
know, many lines of code

160
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:08,980
and we hope that the program does what we,

161
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,548
what we intended it to do.

162
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:13,331
But the thing I've been
interested in is if you

163
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:15,805
just look at the kind of
natural science of programs,

164
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,788
so you just say,

165
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:19,334
I'm gonna make this program,
it's a really tiny program.

166
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,603
Maybe I even pick the pieces
of the program at random,

167
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:22,437
but it's really tiny.

168
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:23,692
And by really tiny, I mean, you know,

169
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,475
less than a line of code type thing.

170
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:29,636
You say, what does this
program do? And you run it.

171
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:32,052
And big discovery that I
made in the early eighties

172
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:36,435
is that even extremely simple
programs when you run them

173
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,132
can do really complicated things.

174
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,239
Really surprised me.

175
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:41,259
It took me several years
to kind of realize that

176
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,235
that was a thing, so to speak,

177
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:46,651
but that that realization
that even very simple programs

178
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,378
can do incredibly complicated things

179
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:51,829
that we very much don't
expect that discovery, I mean,

180
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:55,287
I realized that that's very
much, I think how nature works.

181
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:57,229
That is nature has simple rules,

182
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,559
but yet does all sorts
of complicated things

183
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,686
that we might not expect, you know,

184
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:04,237
as a big thing of the last few
years has been understanding

185
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:07,117
that that's how the whole
universe and physics works.

186
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:09,358
But that's a, a quite separate topic.

187
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,389
But, so there's this
whole world of programs

188
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,533
and what they do and very rich,

189
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,182
sophisticated things that
these programs can do.

190
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:19,254
But when we look at
many of these programs,

191
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,742
we look at them and say,
well that's kind of,

192
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,291
I don't really know what that's doing.

193
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,564
It's not a very human kind of thing.

194
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,901
So on the one hand we have
sort of what's possible

195
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,574
in the computational universe.

196
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,408
On the other hand,

197
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,774
we have the kinds of things
that we humans think about,

198
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:33,096
the kinds of things that have developed

199
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,110
in kind of our intellectual history.

200
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,894
And that's, and the, the really,

201
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:41,396
the challenge to sort of
making things computational

202
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:44,109
is to connect what's
computationally possible

203
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,540
out in the computational
universe with the things

204
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,677
that we humans sort of typically
think about with our minds.

205
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:53,740
Now that's a complicated
kind of moving target

206
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,437
because the things that we
think about change over time,

207
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,743
we've learnt more stuff,
we've invented mathematics,

208
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:02,477
we've invented various kinds of ideas

209
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,086
and structures and so on.

210
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,497
So it's, it's gradually expanding.

211
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,148
We're kind of gradually
colonizing more and more

212
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,817
of this kind of intellectual
space of possibilities.

213
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,404
But the, the real thing,

214
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:14,959
the real challenge is how do you take,

215
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,748
what is computationally possible?

216
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:17,766
How do you take,

217
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,736
how do you encapsulate the kinds of things

218
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,868
that we think about in a
way that kind of plugs into

219
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,726
what's computationally possible.

220
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:28,336
And and actually the, the,
the big sort of idea there

221
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:31,326
is this idea of kind of
symbolic programming,

222
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,739
symbolic representations of things.

223
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,298
And so the, the question
is when you look at

224
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:38,718
sort of everything in the world
and you kind of, you know,

225
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,287
you take some visual scene or something

226
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:42,118
you're looking at and then you say, well,

227
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:43,781
how do I turn that into something

228
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,020
that I can kind of stuff into my mind?

229
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,699
You know, there are lots of
pixels in my visual scene,

230
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,021
but the things that I remembered
from that visual scene are,

231
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,597
you know, there's a chair in this place,

232
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,067
it's a kind of a symbolic representation

233
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,847
of the visual scene.

234
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,357
There are two chairs on
a table or something,

235
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,174
rather than there are
all these pixels arranged

236
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:03,625
in all these detailed ways.

237
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,774
And so the question then is how
do you take sort of all the,

238
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,102
all the things in the world

239
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:10,046
and make some kind of representation

240
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,824
that corresponds to the types of ways

241
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,024
that we think about things.

242
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:15,879
And, and human language is,

243
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,934
is sort of one form of
representation that we have.

244
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:19,912
We talk about chairs,

245
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,990
that's a word in human language and so on.

246
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,168
How do we, how do we take,

247
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,711
but human language is not
in and of itself something

248
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:31,465
from that plugs in very
well to sort of computation.

249
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,679
It's not something from which you can

250
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:35,632
immediately compute
consequences and so on.

251
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:39,752
And so you have to kind of
find a way to take sort of the,

252
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:42,800
the, the stuff we understand
from human language

253
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:44,721
and make it more precise.

254
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:48,216
And that's really the story
of, of symbolic programming.

255
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:49,138
And you know what,

256
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,239
what that turns into is something

257
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,903
which I didn't know at the time

258
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,961
it was going to work as well as it has,

259
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,046
but back in the 1979 or so,

260
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:59,336
I was trying to build my
first big computer system

261
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:00,625
and trying to figure out, you know,

262
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,831
how should I represent
computations at a high level.

263
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,920
And I kind of invented
this idea of using kind of

264
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,886
symbolic expressions, you know,

265
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,830
structured as it's kind of like a,

266
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,351
a function and a bunch of arguments,

267
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:18,039
but that function doesn't
necessarily evaluate to anything.

268
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,368
It's just a, a thing that sits there

269
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,288
representing a structure.

270
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,465
And so building up that structure

271
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:28,273
and it's turned out that
structure has been extremely,

272
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:31,288
it's a, it's a good match
for the way that we humans,

273
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,216
it seems to be a good match for the way

274
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:36,826
that we humans kind of
conceptualize higher level things.

275
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,385
And it's been for the last, I don't know,

276
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:42,570
45 years or something, it's
served me remarkably well.

277
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,255
- So building up that structure

278
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,601
using this kind of
symbolic representation.

279
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:49,994
But what can you say
about abstractions here?

280
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,641
Because you could just start
with your physics project.

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,344
You could start at a hypergraph at a very,

282
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:56,955
very low level and build
up everything from there,

283
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,531
but you don't, right, you take shortcuts.

284
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,363
- [Wolfram] Right?

285
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,426
- You, you take the highest
level of abstraction,

286
00:12:03,426 --> 00:12:04,509
convert that,

287
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,594
the kind of abstraction that's
convertible to something

288
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:12,377
computable using symbolic
representation and then that,

289
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:13,607
that's your new foundation

290
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,982
for that little piece of knowledge.

291
00:12:14,982 --> 00:12:15,815
- [Wolfram] Yes.

292
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,096
- Somehow all that is integrated.

293
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:21,177
- Right? So the, the sort of
a very important phenomenon

294
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:24,858
that is kind of a thing that
I've sort of realized is just,

295
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,633
it's one of these things
that sort of in the,

296
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:29,716
in the future of kind
of everything is going

297
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:30,884
to become more and more important

298
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,691
as this phenomenon of
computational reducibility.

299
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,570
And the, the question is,

300
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,282
if you know the rules for
something, you have a program,

301
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,253
you're gonna run it.

302
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:40,950
You might say, I know the rules, great,

303
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,652
I know everything about
what's gonna happen.

304
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:46,300
Well in principle you do
because you can just run those

305
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,517
rules out and just see what they do.

306
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,932
You might run them a million
steps, you see what happens,

307
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,043
et cetera.

308
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:53,323
The question is,

309
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:55,885
can you like immediately
jump ahead and say,

310
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:58,204
I know what's gonna happen
after a million steps.

311
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,330
And the answer is 13 or something.

312
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,509
- [Fridman] Yes.

313
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:03,173
- And the, the one of
the very critical things

314
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:07,357
to realize is if you could
reduce that computation,

315
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:08,190
there isn't a sense,

316
00:13:08,191 --> 00:13:09,788
no point in doing the computation.

317
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,621
- [Fridman] Yeah.

318
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,252
- The place where you really
get value outta doing the

319
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:15,461
computation is when you
had to do the computation

320
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,116
to find out the answer.

321
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,189
But this phenomenon that you
have to do the computation

322
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,124
to find out the answer,

323
00:13:20,124 --> 00:13:22,942
this phenomenon of computational
reducibility seems to be

324
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,899
tremendously important for thinking about

325
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,148
lots of kinds of things.

326
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,284
So one of the things
that happens is, okay,

327
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:31,404
you've got a model of the
universe at the low level in terms

328
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:33,179
of atoms of space and hypergraphs

329
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,221
and rewriting hypergraphs and so on.

330
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,253
And it's happening, you know,

331
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,965
10 to the 100 times
every second, let's say.

332
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,677
Well, you say great, then
we've, we've nailed it.

333
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,820
We've, we've, we know
how the universe works.

334
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,591
Well the problem is the
universe can figure out

335
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,716
what it's gonna do.

336
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:50,467
It does those 10 to the
100, you know, steps.

337
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,652
But for us to work out what it's gonna do,

338
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:55,286
we have no way to reduce that computation.

339
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,243
The only way to do the computation,

340
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,980
to see the result of the
computation is to do it.

341
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,965
And if we're operating
within the universe,

342
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:03,853
we're kind of, there's no,

343
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:05,710
there's no opportunity to
do that because the universe

344
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,037
is doing it as fast as
the universe can do it.

345
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:09,947
And that's, you know,
that's what's happening.

346
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:11,442
So what we're trying to do,

347
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:12,275
and a lot of the story of science and

348
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:15,048
a lot of other kinds of things

349
00:14:15,048 --> 00:14:17,817
is finding pockets of reducibility.

350
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:18,650
That is,

351
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,832
you could have a situation
where everything in the world

352
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:22,817
is full of computational reducibility,

353
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,800
we never know what's gonna happen next.

354
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,960
The only way we can figure out
what's gonna happen next is

355
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,595
just let the system run
and see what happens.

356
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,725
So in a sense, the story of,

357
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,859
of most kinds of science, inventions,

358
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:37,347
a lot of kinds of things is
the story of finding these

359
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:40,035
places where we can locally jump ahead.

360
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,938
And one of the features of
computational reducibility is

361
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:45,284
there are always pockets of reducibility.

362
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,429
There are always places,

363
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,940
there are always an
infinite number of places

364
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,139
where you can jump ahead.

365
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,394
There's no way where you
can jump completely ahead.

366
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:53,995
But there are little, little patches,

367
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:56,517
little places where you
can jump ahead a bit.

368
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:57,397
And I think, you know,

369
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,307
we can talk about physics
project and so on,

370
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:02,500
but I think the thing we
realize is we kind of exist

371
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,277
in a slice of all the
possible computational

372
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,211
id reducibility in the universe.

373
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,451
We exist in a slice where
there's a reasonable amount

374
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,995
of predictability.

375
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,317
And in a sense,

376
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:15,890
as we try and construct these
kind of higher levels of,

377
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,110
of abstraction symbolic
representations and so on,

378
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,317
what we're doing is
we're finding these lumps

379
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:26,019
of reducibility that we can
kind of attach ourselves to

380
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,635
and about, which we can kind of have

381
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,641
fairly simple narrative things to say.

382
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:30,757
Because in principle, you know,

383
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:33,944
I say what's gonna happen
in the next few seconds?

384
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:34,778
You know, oh,

385
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:36,250
there are these molecules
moving around in the air in this

386
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,625
room and oh gosh,

387
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,144
it's an incredibly complicated
story and that's a whole

388
00:15:41,144 --> 00:15:42,930
computational irreducible thing,

389
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,129
most of which I don't care about.

390
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,520
And most of it is, well, you know,

391
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,774
the air's still gonna be here
and nothing much is going to

392
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,158
be different about it.

393
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,225
And that's a kind of reducible fact

394
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:56,320
about what is ultimately
at an underlying level

395
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,887
of computational irreducible process.

396
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:03,903
- And life would not be possible
if we didn't have a large

397
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,447
number of such reducible pockets.

398
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:07,557
- [Wolfram] Yes.

399
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:11,465
- Pockets amenable to reduction
into something symbolic.

400
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,302
- Yes, I think so.

401
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:15,823
Okay. I mean, life in, in the
way that we experience it,

402
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:19,974
that, I mean, you know,
one might, you know,

403
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:23,600
depending on what we mean by
life, so to speak, the, the,

404
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,759
the experience that we have
of sort of consistent things

405
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,326
happening in the world, the
idea of space, for example,

406
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:33,038
where there's, you know, we
can just say you are here,

407
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:36,077
you move there, it's
kind of the same thing.

408
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:38,790
It's still you in that different
place even though you're

409
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,136
made of different atoms
of space and so on.

410
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:44,126
This is this idea that it's,

411
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:46,397
that there's sort of this
level of predictability

412
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:47,574
of what's going on.

413
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,229
That's us finding a slice
of reducibility in what is

414
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,311
underneath this computation
irreducible kind of system.

415
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,032
And I think that's, that's sort of the,

416
00:16:57,032 --> 00:17:00,203
the thing which is actually
my favorite discovery

417
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:01,858
of the last few years,

418
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:05,350
is the realization that it
is sort of the interaction

419
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,379
between this sort of
underlying computational

420
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,179
irrereducibility and our
nature as kind of observers

421
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,110
who sort of have to key into
computational reducibility.

422
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,300
That fact leads to the main
laws of physics that we

423
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,242
discovered in through 20th century.

424
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,250
So this is, we talk about
this in, in in more detail,

425
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,000
but this is, to me, it's kind
of our nature as observers.

426
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,396
The fact that we are
computationally bounded observers.

427
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:36,404
We don't get to follow
all those little pieces of

428
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:39,548
computational irrereducibility to stuff.

429
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:43,115
What is about out there in the
world into our minds requires

430
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,781
that we are looking at
things that are reducible,

431
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,659
we are compressing kind of, we are,

432
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,427
we're extracting just some essence,

433
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:51,851
some kind of symbolic essence

434
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:54,119
of what's the detail of
what's going on in the world.

435
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,654
That together with one other condition

436
00:17:56,654 --> 00:17:59,879
that first seems sort
of trivial but isn't,

437
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,887
which is that we believe
we are persistent in time.

438
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:03,998
That is.

439
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:04,909
- Yes.

440
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:05,742
- [Wolfram] You know.

441
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:07,453
- So causality.

442
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,349
- Here's the thing. At every
moment according to our theory,

443
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,695
we are made of different atoms
of space at every moment.

444
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,807
Sort of the microscopic detail
of what what the universe

445
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,462
is made of is being rewritten.

446
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,296
And that's, and in fact,

447
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,621
the very fact that this coherence
between different parts of

448
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:25,901
space is a consequence of the
fact that there are all these

449
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:28,246
little processes going on
that kind of knit together the

450
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,245
structure of space.

451
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,525
It's kind of like if you wanted
to have a fluid with a bunch

452
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,590
of molecules in it, if those
molecules weren't interacting,

453
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,820
you wouldn't have this
fluid that would pour

454
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,099
and do all these kinds of things.

455
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,548
It would just be sort of
a free floating collection

456
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:40,475
of molecules.

457
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,683
So similar it is with space
that the fact that space is kind

458
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,395
of knitted together as a consequence

459
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:47,004
of all this activity in space.

460
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,246
And the fact that kind of what,

461
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:53,727
what we consist of sort of
this, this series of, of of,

462
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,838
you know, we're, we're
continually being rewritten.

463
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:56,950
And the question is,

464
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,533
why is it the case that
we think of ourselves

465
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,823
as being the same us through time?

466
00:19:02,824 --> 00:19:04,526
That's kind of a, a key assumption.

467
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:07,166
I think it's a key aspect of
what we see as sort of our

468
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,044
consciousness so to speak,

469
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:11,028
is that we have this kind of consistent

470
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,395
thread of experience.

471
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:16,812
- Well isn't that just
another limitation of our mind

472
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,350
that we wanna reduce-

473
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:21,182
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

474
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:24,821
- Reality into some that kind of temporal

475
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:25,654
- [Wolfram] Yes.

476
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,266
- Consistency is just a nice
narrative to tell ourselves.

477
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,427
- [Wolfram] Right.

478
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:29,935
Well, the fact is,

479
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,866
I think it's critical to the
way we humans typically operate

480
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:35,538
is that we have a single
thread of experience.

481
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,324
You know, if you, if
you imagine sort of a,

482
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,907
a mind where you have, you know,

483
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,553
maybe that's what's happening
in various kinds of minds that

484
00:19:42,554 --> 00:19:46,195
aren't working the same
way other minds work

485
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,105
is that you're splitting into

486
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:48,298
multiple threads of experience.

487
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:50,617
It's also, it's also
something where, you know,

488
00:19:50,617 --> 00:19:51,723
when you look at, I don't know,

489
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,715
quantum mechanics for example,

490
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,928
in the insides of quantum mechanics,

491
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,170
it's splitting into many
threads of experience.

492
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,209
But in order for us humans
to interact with it,

493
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:04,026
you kind of have to have to
knit all those different threads

494
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:05,847
together so that we say, oh yeah,

495
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,681
a definite thing happened and now the next

496
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,237
definite thing happens and so on.

497
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:13,086
And I think, you know, sort of inside it,

498
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:17,346
it's sort of interesting to
try and imagine what's it like

499
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:20,787
to have kind of these
fundamentally multiple threads

500
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,750
of experience going on.

501
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,018
I mean, right now different human minds

502
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,841
have different threads of experience.

503
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,173
We just have a bunch of minds that

504
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,007
are interacting with each other,

505
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:31,018
but we don't have a a you know,

506
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:34,041
within each mind there's a single thread.

507
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:34,891
And that's a,

508
00:20:34,892 --> 00:20:36,451
that is indeed a simplification.

509
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,987
I think it's a, it's a thing, you know,

510
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,695
the general computational system

511
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:41,897
does not have that simplification.

512
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:43,618
And it's one of the things, you know,

513
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,947
I I people often seem
to think that, you know,

514
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:46,948
consciousness is the,

515
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:50,018
the highest level of kind
of things that can happen

516
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:51,338
in the universe, so to speak.

517
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:52,172
But I think that's not true.

518
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:53,616
I think it's actually a,

519
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:56,946
a a specialization in
which among other things,

520
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:59,184
you have this idea of a
single thread of experience,

521
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:02,465
which is not a general feature
of anything that could kind

522
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:04,346
of computationally happen in the universe.

523
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,128
- So it's a feature of a
computationally limited system

524
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:10,961
that's only able to
observe reducible pockets.

525
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:14,115
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

526
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:17,359
- So I mean this word observer, it,

527
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,067
it means something in quantum mechanics,

528
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:22,434
it means something in a lot of places.

529
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,109
It means something to us humans.

530
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:25,365
- [Wolfram] Right.

531
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:26,524
- As conscious beings. So what,

532
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:30,619
what's the importance of the
observer? What is the observer?

533
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:32,007
What's the importance of the observer

534
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,873
in the computational universe?

535
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,179
- So this question of what is an observer?

536
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,090
What's the general idea of an observer?

537
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,935
It's actually one of my next
projects which got somewhat

538
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:43,401
derailed by the, the current
sort of AI mania. But-

539
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,751
- Is there a connection
there or is that, do you,

540
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:48,585
do you think the observer
primarily a physics phenomena?

541
00:21:48,585 --> 00:21:50,220
- Is it related to the whole AI thing?

542
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,053
- Yes.

543
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:51,886
- [Wolfram] Yes, it is related.

544
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:54,596
So one question is, what
is a general observer?

545
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:55,430
So, you know,

546
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,796
we know we have an idea what is

547
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,390
a general computational system.

548
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,734
We think about touring machines,

549
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,148
we think about other
models of computation.

550
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:04,428
There's a question, what is a
general model of an observer?

551
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:07,965
And there there's kind
of observers like us,

552
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:10,540
which is kind of the
observers we're interested in.

553
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,973
You know, we could imagine an
alien observer that deals with

554
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:15,287
computational I irrereducibility
and it has a mind that's

555
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,076
utterly different from ours and,

556
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:20,241
and completely incoherent
with what, what we are like.

557
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:22,019
But the fact is that that, you know,

558
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:24,817
if we are talking about observers like us,

559
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:28,721
that one of the key things is
this idea of kind of taking

560
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,171
all the detail of the world

561
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:32,699
and being able to stuff it into a mind,

562
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,931
being able to take all
the detail and kind of,

563
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,660
you know, extract out
of it a smaller set of,

564
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,508
of kind of degrees of freedom.

565
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:41,617
A smaller number of,

566
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:45,042
of elements that will
sort of fit in our minds.

567
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,596
And I think this, this question,

568
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:49,179
so I've been interested
in trying to characterize

569
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,340
what is the general observer.

570
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,076
And the general observer is,

571
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:55,644
I think in part there are many,

572
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,898
let let me give an example of
a, you know, you have a gas,

573
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:01,098
it's got a bunch of molecules
bouncing around and the thing

574
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:03,915
you are measuring about
the gas is it's pressure.

575
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,500
And the only thing you as an observer

576
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,155
care about is pressure.

577
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:09,971
And that means you have a
piston on the side of this box

578
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,618
and the piston is being pushed by the gas.

579
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:13,451
And there are many,

580
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:16,069
many different ways that
molecules can hit that piston.

581
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:19,221
But all that matters is
the kind of aggregate

582
00:23:19,221 --> 00:23:21,236
of all those molecular impacts.

583
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,831
Because that's what determines pressure.

584
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,913
So there's a huge number
of different configurations

585
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:27,241
of the gas, which are all equivalent.

586
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,950
So I think one key aspect of
observers is this equivalent

587
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,245
thing of many different
configurations of a system saying,

588
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,596
all I care about is
this aggregate feature.

589
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:38,485
All I care about is
this, this overall thing.

590
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,685
And that's, that's sort
of one, one aspect.

591
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:43,181
And we see that in lots
of different, again,

592
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,211
it's the same story over
and over again that there's,

593
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:47,164
there's a lot of detail in the world,

594
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,389
but what we are extracting from it

595
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,045
is something a sort of a thin,

596
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:53,620
a thin summary of that, of that detail.

597
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:56,914
- Is that thin summary nevertheless true.

598
00:23:56,914 --> 00:24:01,498
Is can it be a crappy
approximation that an average is,

599
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,344
is correct.

600
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,177
I mean, if we look at the observer,

601
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:08,721
that's the human mind, it seems
like there's a lot of very,

602
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:10,572
as represented by natural
language for example,

603
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,730
there's a lot of really
crappy approximation.

604
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,564
- [Wolfram] Sure.

605
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:15,897
- And that could be maybe a feature of it.

606
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:16,876
- [Wolfram] Well, yes.

607
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,127
- But there's ambiguity.

608
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:18,961
- [Wolfram] Right, right.

609
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,759
You don't know, you know,
it could be the case you,

610
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,478
you're just measuring
the aggregate impacts

611
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:24,772
of these molecules,
but there is some tiny,

612
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,597
tiny probability that molecules
will arrange themselves

613
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:29,253
in some really funky way.

614
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:32,174
And that just measuring that average isn't

615
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:33,008
going to be the main point.

616
00:24:33,008 --> 00:24:33,841
- [Fridman] Yeah.

617
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,673
- By the way,

618
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,635
an awful lot of science is very
confused about this because,

619
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:38,469
you know, you look at,

620
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,931
you look at papers and
people are really keen,

621
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:42,949
they draw this curve and
they have these, you know,

622
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,412
these bars on the curve and things.

623
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:47,834
And it's just this curve
and it's this one thing,

624
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,890
and it's supposed to represent
some system that has all

625
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,617
kinds of details in it.

626
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,010
And this is a way that lots
of science has gotten wrong

627
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,844
because people say,

628
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,097
I remember years ago I was
studying snowflake growth that,

629
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,979
you know, you have the
snowflake and it's growing,

630
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,586
it has all these arms, it's
doing complicated things.

631
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,137
But there was a literature
on this stuff and it talked

632
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,529
about, you know, what's the
rate of snowflake growth?

633
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:09,363
And you know, it,

634
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:10,946
it got pretty good answers

635
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,646
for the rate of the
growth of the snowflake.

636
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:14,188
And they looked at it more carefully.

637
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:15,853
And then they had these
nice curves of, you know,

638
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:17,259
snowflake growth rates and so on.

639
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,621
I looked at it more carefully
and I realized according to

640
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:22,643
their models, the snowflake
will be spherical.

641
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:25,308
And so they got the growth rate right.

642
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:28,388
But the detail was just utterly wrong.

643
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:30,411
And you know, the not
only the detail, the,

644
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:33,731
the whole thing was, was
not capturing, you know,

645
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:36,522
it was capturing this aspect of the system

646
00:25:36,522 --> 00:25:37,442
that was in a sense,

647
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:39,487
missing the main point
of what was going on.

648
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:43,537
- What is the geometric
shape of a snowflake?

649
00:25:43,537 --> 00:25:45,369
- Snowflakes start in,

650
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,663
in the phase of water that's relevant.

651
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:48,496
- [Fridman] Yeah.

652
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:49,329
- To the formation of snowflakes.

653
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,792
It's a phase of ice,

654
00:25:50,792 --> 00:25:52,712
which starts with a
hexagonal arrangement of,

655
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:54,392
of water molecules.

656
00:25:54,392 --> 00:25:56,937
And so it starts off growing
as a hexagonal plate.

657
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:58,298
And then what happens is-

658
00:25:58,298 --> 00:26:00,535
- Is the plate, oh, oh versus sphere.

659
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:02,335
- Well, no, no, but it's,
it's much more than that.

660
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:04,113
I mean, snowflakes are fluffy, you know,

661
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:07,032
typical snowflakes have
little, little dendritic arms.

662
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:07,865
- [Fridman] Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

663
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,214
- And, and what actually happens is,

664
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,794
it's kind of kind of cool
because you can make these very

665
00:26:11,795 --> 00:26:14,504
simple discrete models with
cellular automata and things

666
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:16,602
that, that figure this out.

667
00:26:16,603 --> 00:26:19,392
You start off with this,
you know, hexagonal thing,

668
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:21,210
and then the places it,

669
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,293
it starts to grow little arms,

670
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,613
and every time a little piece of ice,

671
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,518
it adds itself to the snowflake.

672
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,392
The fact that that ice condensed
from the water vapor heats

673
00:26:31,392 --> 00:26:33,344
the snowflake up locally.

674
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:36,326
And so it makes it less likely for,

675
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:40,389
for another piece of ice
to accumulate right nearby.

676
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:41,983
So this leads to a kind
of growth inhibition.

677
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:44,343
So you grow an arm and it, it is a,

678
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:48,501
a separated arm because right
around the arm it got a little

679
00:26:48,501 --> 00:26:51,557
bit hot and it didn't add more ice there.

680
00:26:51,557 --> 00:26:53,583
So what happens is it
grows, you have a hexagon,

681
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:55,919
it grows out arms, the arms grow arms,

682
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,724
and then the arms grow arms grow arms.

683
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:00,133
And eventually, actually
it's kind of cool because it,

684
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:03,333
it actually fills in another
hexagon, a bigger hexagon.

685
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,724
And when I first looked at this, you know,

686
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,938
had a very simple model for
this, I realized, you know,

687
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,293
when it fills in that hexagon,

688
00:27:08,292 --> 00:27:10,244
it actually leaves some holes behind.

689
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:12,299
So I thought, well, you know,
that is that really right?

690
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,187
So I look at these pictures
of snowflakes and sure enough

691
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:17,204
they have these little holes
in them that are kind of scars

692
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,413
of the way that these arms grow out.

693
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:24,613
- So you can't fill in backfill
holes. So you keep going.

694
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:25,565
- They don't backfill.

695
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:26,816
Yeah, they don't backfill.

696
00:27:26,816 --> 00:27:28,360
- And, and presumably there's
a limitation on how big,

697
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,440
like you can't arbitrarily grow.

698
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,520
- I'm not sure. I mean, the
thing falls through the, the,

699
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,023
I mean, I think it does, you know,

700
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,936
it hits the ground at some point.

701
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:38,415
I think you can grow.

702
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:40,875
I I think you can grow in the lab.

703
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,144
I think you can grow pretty big ones.

704
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:43,824
I think you can grow
many, many iterations of,

705
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,339
this kind of goes from
hexagon, it grows out arms,

706
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:48,495
it turns back, it fills
back into a hexagon.

707
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:49,826
It grows more arms again in.

708
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:50,659
- In 3D.

709
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,325
- No. It's flat usually.

710
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:54,448
- Why is it flat?

711
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,919
Why doesn't it spin out?
Okay, okay, wait a minute.

712
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,884
You said it's fluffy and
fluffy is a three-dimensional

713
00:27:58,884 --> 00:27:59,990
property, no or.

714
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,581
- No, it's, it's fluffy snow is.

715
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:05,422
Okay. So you know what makes we're really,

716
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:06,472
we're really in a-

717
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:07,895
- [Fridman] Let's go there.

718
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,269
Multiple snowflakes become fluffy.

719
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:12,248
A single snowflake is not fluffy?

720
00:28:12,248 --> 00:28:13,081
- No, no.

721
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,621
A single snowflake is fluffy.

722
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:16,180
And what happens is, you know,

723
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,246
if, if you have snow that
is just pure hexagons, they,

724
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:23,109
they can, you know, they,
they fit together pretty well.

725
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,485
It's not, it doesn't, it doesn't make,

726
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:26,014
it doesn't have a lot of air in it.

727
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,662
And they can also slide against
each other pretty easily.

728
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,404
And so the snow can be
pretty, you know, can,

729
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:32,845
I think avalanches happen sometimes when,

730
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,469
when the things tend
to be these, you know,

731
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:38,167
hexagonal plates and it kind of slides.

732
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,156
But then when the thing has all these arms

733
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:41,268
that have grown out,

734
00:28:41,268 --> 00:28:43,221
it's not, they don't
fit together very well.

735
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,780
And that's why the snow
has lots of air in it.

736
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,948
And if you look at one
of these snowflakes,

737
00:28:46,949 --> 00:28:50,134
and if you catch one, you'll
see it has these little arms.

738
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:52,653
And people actually,
people often say, you know,

739
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:54,467
no two snowflakes are alike.

740
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,052
That's mostly because
as a snowflake grows,

741
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,884
they do grow pretty consistently

742
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:01,394
with these different arms and so on.

743
00:29:01,394 --> 00:29:03,970
But you capture them at
different times as they,

744
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,075
you know, they fell through,

745
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:07,690
through the air in a different way.

746
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,802
You'll catch this one, this stage.

747
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:10,842
And as it goes through different stages,

748
00:29:10,843 --> 00:29:12,255
they look really different.

749
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:13,402
And so that's why, you know,

750
00:29:13,402 --> 00:29:15,992
it kinda looks like no two
snowflakes are alike because you

751
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:18,162
caught them at different,
at different times.

752
00:29:18,162 --> 00:29:20,694
- So the rules under which
they grow are the same.

753
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:21,528
- [Wolfram] Yes.

754
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:22,655
- It's just the timing is-

755
00:29:22,655 --> 00:29:23,489
- [Wolfram] Yes.

756
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:24,322
- Okay. So the point is,

757
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:27,165
science is not able to describe

758
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,921
the full complexity of snowflake growth.

759
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,254
- Well science, if you,

760
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,659
if you do what people might often do,

761
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,509
which is say, okay,
let's make it scientific,

762
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,659
let's turn into one number,

763
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,396
and that one number is kind
of the growth rate of the arms

764
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:42,066
or some such other thing,

765
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:44,467
that fails to capture
sort of the detail of

766
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,390
what's going on inside the system.

767
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,223
And that's, in a sense,

768
00:29:47,222 --> 00:29:51,012
a big challenge for science
is how do you extract from the

769
00:29:51,012 --> 00:29:53,069
natural world, for example,

770
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:56,320
those aspects of it
that you are interested

771
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,457
in talking about.

772
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:58,291
Now you might just say,

773
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,506
I don't really care about the
fluffiness of the snowflakes.

774
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,092
All I care about is the
growth rate of the arms.

775
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,993
In which case, you know, you have,

776
00:30:04,992 --> 00:30:07,184
you can have a good model
without knowing anything

777
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:09,120
about the fluffiness.

778
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:11,801
But the fact is, as a practical,
you know, when if you,

779
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,913
if you say what's the,

780
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,121
what is the most obvious
feature of a snowflake?

781
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:17,304
Oh, that it has this complicated shape,

782
00:30:17,304 --> 00:30:20,343
well then you've got a different
story about what you model.

783
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:22,112
I mean, this, this is
one of the features of,

784
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,224
of sort of modeling and
science that, you know,

785
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,057
what is a model?

786
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:28,455
A model is some way of reducing
the actuality of the world

787
00:30:28,455 --> 00:30:31,622
to something where you can
readily sort of give a narrative

788
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,951
for what's happening,

789
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:35,853
where you can basically make
some kind of abstraction of

790
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:38,315
what's happening and answer questions

791
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:39,913
that you care about answering.

792
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:41,355
If you wanted to answer all possible

793
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:42,868
questions about the system,

794
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,163
you'd have to have the whole
system because you might care

795
00:30:45,163 --> 00:30:46,275
about this particular molecule.

796
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,390
Where did it go?

797
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,498
And you know, your model,

798
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:50,456
which is some big abstraction of that

799
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,370
has nothing to say about that.

800
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:54,034
So, you know, one of the things that's,

801
00:30:54,034 --> 00:30:55,852
that's often confusing in sciences,

802
00:30:55,852 --> 00:30:58,030
people will have, I've got
a model, somebody says,

803
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:58,863
somebody else will say,

804
00:30:58,863 --> 00:31:00,621
I don't believe in your model
because it doesn't capture

805
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:03,052
the feature of the
system that I care about.

806
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:04,644
You know, there's always
this controversy about,

807
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:07,377
you know, is the, is it a correct model?

808
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,492
Well, no model is a,

809
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,396
except for the actual system itself

810
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:13,682
is a correct model in the sense
that it captures everything.

811
00:31:13,682 --> 00:31:16,325
Question is, does it capture
what you care about capturing?

812
00:31:16,325 --> 00:31:19,139
Sometimes that's ultimately
defined by what you're going to

813
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,539
build technology out of things like this.

814
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,418
The one counterexample to
this is if you think you're

815
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,994
modeling the whole
universe all the way down,

816
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:30,425
then there is a notion of a correct model.

817
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:33,395
But even that is more complicated
because it depends on kind

818
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,571
of how observers sample things and so on.

819
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:36,985
That's a, that's a separate story,

820
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:39,770
but at least at the first
level to say, you know,

821
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,610
this thing about, oh,
it's an approximation.

822
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:42,777
You're capturing one aspect,

823
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,514
you're not capturing other aspects.

824
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:45,834
When you really think
you have a complete model

825
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:47,778
for the whole universe,

826
00:31:47,778 --> 00:31:50,836
you better be capturing
ultimately everything,

827
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:54,556
even though to actually run
that model is impossible because

828
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:56,329
of computational reducibility.

829
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:57,163
The only,

830
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:59,115
the only thing that
successfully runs that model

831
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,213
is the actual running of the universe.

832
00:32:01,213 --> 00:32:02,781
- Is the universe itself. But okay,

833
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:06,518
so what you care about is
an interesting concept.

834
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:09,039
So that's a, that's a human concept.

835
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,498
So that's what you're
doing with Wolfram Alpha

836
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,006
and Wolfram Language,

837
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:17,360
is you're trying to come up
with symbolic representations.

838
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,571
- [Wolfram] Yes.

839
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:20,571
- As simple as possible.

840
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:25,303
So a model that's as simple as
possible that fully captures

841
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:26,605
stuff we care about.

842
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:27,462
- [Wolfram] Yes.

843
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:30,902
So I mean, for example, you
know, we could we'll have a,

844
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,712
a thing about, you
know, data about movies,

845
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:35,124
let's say we could be describing

846
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,770
every individual pixel
in every movie and so on.

847
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,524
But that's not the level
that people care about.

848
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,701
And it's, yes, this is a, I mean, and,

849
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:46,909
and that level that people
care about is somewhat related

850
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,423
to what's described in natural language.

851
00:32:49,423 --> 00:32:53,046
But what what we're trying to
do is to find a way to sort of

852
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:55,699
represent precisely so
you can compute things.

853
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,221
See one thing when you say
you give a piece of a natural

854
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,134
language question is you
feed it to a computer.

855
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:01,968
You say,

856
00:33:01,968 --> 00:33:04,115
does the computer understand
this natural language?

857
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,230
Well, you know,

858
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,340
the computer processes it
in some way it does this,

859
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,844
maybe it can make a continuation
of the natural language.

860
00:33:09,845 --> 00:33:10,678
You know,

861
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:11,911
maybe it can go on from the prompt

862
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:13,150
and say what it's gonna say.

863
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,711
You say, does it really understand it?

864
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,014
Hard to know.

865
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:21,109
But for in this kind
of computational world,

866
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:24,429
there is a very definite
definition of does it understand,

867
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:28,166
which is could it be turned
into this symbolic computational

868
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:31,692
thing from which you can compute
all kinds of consequences?

869
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:32,693
And that's the,

870
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:35,052
that's the sense in which
one has sort of a target

871
00:33:35,053 --> 00:33:37,150
for the understanding of natural language.

872
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,735
And that's kind of our goal
is to have as much as possible

873
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:44,045
about the world that can be computed in a,

874
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,055
in a reasonable way, so to speak,

875
00:33:46,055 --> 00:33:48,574
be able to be sort of captured

876
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:50,399
by this kind of computational language.

877
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:51,710
That's, that's kind of the goal.

878
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,711
And, and I think for us humans, the,

879
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:57,293
the main thing that's important
is as we formalize what

880
00:33:57,292 --> 00:33:58,486
we're talking about,

881
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:01,719
it gives us a way of kind of
building a structure where we

882
00:34:01,719 --> 00:34:05,054
can sort of build this tower
of consequences of things.

883
00:34:05,054 --> 00:34:06,340
So if we're just saying, well,

884
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,255
let's talk about it a natural language,

885
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,389
it doesn't really give us some
hard foundation that lets us,

886
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,085
you know, build step by
step to work something out.

887
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,924
I mean, it's kind of like
what happens in, in math,

888
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:19,262
if we were just sort of
vaguely talking about math but

889
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:21,603
didn't have the kind of
full structure of math

890
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:23,023
and all that kind of thing,

891
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:24,386
we wouldn't be able to build this kind of

892
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:26,073
big tower of consequences.

893
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,033
And so, you know, in,

894
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,657
in a sense what we're
trying to do with the whole

895
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:32,995
computational language effort
is to make a formalism for

896
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:36,123
describing the world that makes
it possible to kind of build

897
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:38,360
this, this tower of consequences.

898
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,638
- Well can you talk about this dance

899
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,697
between natural language
and Wolfram Language?

900
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:47,126
So there's this gigantic
thing we call the internet

901
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,043
where people post memes

902
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:53,422
and diary type thoughts

903
00:34:53,422 --> 00:34:56,351
and very important sounding
articles and all of that.

904
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:59,126
That makes up the
training data set for GPT,

905
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:02,608
and then there's Wolfram Language.

906
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:06,560
How can you map from the
natural language of the internet

907
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,607
to the Wolfram language?

908
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:13,528
Is there an manual? Is there
an automated way of doing that?

909
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,896
As we look into the future?

910
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:19,079
- Well, so Wolf and Alpha, what it does,

911
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,679
it's kind of front end is
turning natural language into

912
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,646
computational language, right?

913
00:35:24,646 --> 00:35:26,775
- What you mean by that
is there's a prompt,

914
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:30,497
you ask a question, what is
the capital of some country.

915
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:31,766
- And it, and it turns into, you know,

916
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:33,408
what's the distance between, you know,

917
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,671
Chicago and London or something.

918
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,791
And that will turn into, you know,

919
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,125
geo distance of entity city,

920
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,873
you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

921
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,126
Each one of those things is very,

922
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,558
is very well defined.

923
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,392
We know, you know,

924
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:47,791
given that it's the entity
city, Chicago, et cetera,

925
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,726
et cetera, et cetera, you
know, Illinois, United States,

926
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:53,270
you know, we know the geolocation of that.

927
00:35:53,271 --> 00:35:54,512
We know it's population,

928
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:56,791
we know all kinds of things
about it, which we have,

929
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:59,768
you know, curated that data to be able to,

930
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:03,297
to know that with some degree
of certainty, so to speak.

931
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:07,007
And then, then we can
compute things from this.

932
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,217
And that's, that's kind of the yeah.

933
00:36:09,217 --> 00:36:11,319
That, that's, that's that's the idea.

934
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,791
- But then something like
GPT large language models,

935
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:18,167
do they allow you to make that conversion

936
00:36:18,166 --> 00:36:19,942
much more powerful?

937
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:21,200
- Okay, so it's an interesting thing which

938
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:23,247
we still don't know everything about.

939
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:24,081
Okay.

940
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:27,687
The, I mean this question of
going from natural language

941
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,471
to computational language, yes.

942
00:36:29,471 --> 00:36:31,541
In Wolfram Alpha, we've now, you know,

943
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,645
Wolfram Alpha has been
out and about for what,

944
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:34,816
13 and a half years now.

945
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:38,734
And, you know, we've achieved,
I don't know what it is, 98%,

946
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:43,024
99% success on queries
that get put into it.

947
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:44,728
Now, obviously there's
a sort of feedback loop

948
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:46,152
because the things that work are things

949
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:47,639
people go on putting into it.

950
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,951
So yeah, that that, but you know, we've,

951
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:53,304
we've got to a very high
success rate of the,

952
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:56,030
the little fragments of natural
language that put people put

953
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,679
in, you know, questions,
math calculations,

954
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:01,103
chemistry calculations, whatever it is.

955
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:03,981
You know, we can, we can,
we, we do very well at that,

956
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:06,501
turning those things into
computational language.

957
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:09,208
Now I, from the very
beginning of Wolfram Alpha,

958
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:10,750
I thought about, for example,

959
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:14,095
writing code with natural language.

960
00:37:14,094 --> 00:37:16,455
In fact, I had, I, I was just
looking at this recently.

961
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,539
I had a post that I wrote in 2010, 2011

962
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,574
called something like
Programming with Natural Language

963
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,557
is actually Going to Work.

964
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:24,773
Okay. And so, you know,

965
00:37:24,773 --> 00:37:28,911
we had done a bunch of experiments
using methods that were

966
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,019
yeah, a little bit.

967
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,085
Some of them are little
bit machine learning like,

968
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:34,557
but certainly not the same, you know,

969
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:37,989
the same kind of idea of
vast training data and so on.

970
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,205
That is the story of
large language models.

971
00:37:40,206 --> 00:37:43,068
Actually I know that that
post piece of utter trivia,

972
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:43,902
but that,

973
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:47,278
that post Steve Jobs forwarded
that post around to all kinds

974
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:49,044
of people at Apple.

975
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:49,878
And he, you know,

976
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:50,910
that was because he never really liked

977
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,028
programming languages.

978
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:55,693
So he was very happy to see the
idea that that that that you

979
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,732
could get rid of this kind of
layer of kind of engineering

980
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:01,597
like structure he
would've liked, you know,

981
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:02,708
I think what's happening now,

982
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,085
because it really is the
case that you can, you know,

983
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:07,981
this idea that you have to
kind of learn how the computer

984
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:11,949
works to use a programming
language is something that is

985
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:14,163
I think a, a a thing that, you know,

986
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:16,338
just like you had to learn
the details of the op codes

987
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:18,481
to know how similar
language worked and so on.

988
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:19,708
It's kind of a thing that's,

989
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:22,320
that's that's a limited time horizon.

990
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,306
But, but kind of the, the, you know,

991
00:38:24,306 --> 00:38:27,806
so this idea of how elaborate can you make

992
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,766
kind of the prompt,

993
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,402
how elaborate can you
make the natural language

994
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:35,987
and abstract from it
computational language.

995
00:38:35,987 --> 00:38:37,452
It's a very interesting question.

996
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:39,389
And you know what,

997
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:40,889
ChatGPT, you know,

998
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,197
GBT four and so on can do is pretty good.

999
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:48,284
It isn't, it's very interesting process.

1000
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,059
I mean I'm still trying to
understand this workflow.

1001
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,452
We've been working out a lot
of tooling around this workflow

1002
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:56,262
- The natural language to
computational language.

1003
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:57,095
- [Wolfram] Right.

1004
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:57,927
- And the process.

1005
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:00,445
Especially if it's
conversation like dialogue,

1006
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:02,291
it's like multiple queries kind of thing.

1007
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,125
- Yeah. Right.

1008
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,085
There's so many things that
are really interesting that,

1009
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,858
that, that work and so on.

1010
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:08,190
So first thing is,

1011
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,704
can you just walk up to the computer

1012
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:12,701
and expect to sort of
specify a computation?

1013
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:16,967
What one realizes is humans
have to have some idea of kind

1014
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,535
of this way of thinking
about things computationally.

1015
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,557
Without that you're kind of
out of luck because you just

1016
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:24,239
have no idea what you're going
to walk up to a computer.

1017
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,061
I remember when I, I should
tell a silly story about myself,

1018
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:28,784
the very first computer I saw,

1019
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,342
which is when I was 10 years
old and it was a big mainframe

1020
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:32,615
computer and so on,

1021
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,087
and I didn't really understand
what computers did and it's

1022
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:37,486
like somebody's showing me
this computer and it's like,

1023
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:38,461
you know,

1024
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:41,621
can the computer work out
the weight of a dinosaur?

1025
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:43,951
It's like, that isn't a
sensible thing to ask.

1026
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,911
That's kind of, you know,
you have to give it,

1027
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,695
that's not what computers do.

1028
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,492
I mean, and Wolfram Alpha for example,

1029
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:51,898
you could say what's the
typical weight of a stegosaurus?

1030
00:39:51,898 --> 00:39:52,836
And we'll give you some answer,

1031
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:55,012
but that's a very different
kind of thing from what one

1032
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:57,110
thinks of computers as doing.

1033
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,836
And so the, the kind of the
the question of, you know,

1034
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:03,931
first thing is people have
to have an idea of what,

1035
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:06,612
what computation is about.

1036
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,245
You know, I think it's a very, you know,

1037
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:11,298
for education that is the
key thing. It's kind of this,

1038
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:14,619
this, this notion, not computer science,

1039
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:17,141
not so that the details are programming,

1040
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:19,150
but just this idea of how
do you think about the world

1041
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,509
computationally computation,

1042
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:24,507
thinking about the world
computationally is kind of this

1043
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:26,789
formal way of thinking about the world.

1044
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:29,701
We've had other ones, like logic
was a formal way, you know,

1045
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:31,409
as a way of sort of abstracting

1046
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,115
and formalizing some aspects of the world.

1047
00:40:33,115 --> 00:40:34,731
Mathematics is another one.

1048
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:37,525
Computation is this very broad
way of sort of formalizing

1049
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,555
the way we think about the world.

1050
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:40,661
And the thing that's,

1051
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,820
that's cool about computation
is if we can successfully

1052
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,411
formalize things in terms of computation,

1053
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,380
computers can help us figure
out what the consequences are.

1054
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,517
It's not like you formalized it with math.

1055
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,089
Well that's nice, but now you
have to, if you're, you know,

1056
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:55,974
not using a computer to do the math,

1057
00:40:55,974 --> 00:40:58,708
you have to go work out a
bunch of stuff yourself.

1058
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:02,202
So I think, but the, this idea,
let's see, I mean the, the,

1059
00:41:02,202 --> 00:41:05,380
you know, we're trying
to take kind of the,

1060
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,443
we're talking about
sort of natural language

1061
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:09,653
and its relationship to
computational language.

1062
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,451
The, the thing,

1063
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:14,230
the sort of the typical workflow
I think is first human has

1064
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,469
to have some kind of idea of
what they're trying to do.

1065
00:41:17,469 --> 00:41:18,302
That if it,

1066
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:20,846
if it's something that they
want to sort of build a tower

1067
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,876
of, of capabilities on something
that they want to sort of

1068
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:26,140
formalize and make computational,

1069
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:29,740
so then human can type
something into, you know,

1070
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,990
some LLM system and sort of say vaguely

1071
00:41:35,012 --> 00:41:38,038
what they want in sort
of computational terms,

1072
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,583
then it does pretty well at synthesizing

1073
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,173
Wolfram Language code,

1074
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:44,157
and it'll probably do better in the future

1075
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:46,791
because we've got a huge
number of examples of,

1076
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,803
of natural language input
together with the Wolfram Language

1077
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:51,260
translation of that.

1078
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,971
So it's kind of a, a you know,

1079
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:57,835
that that's a thing where you
can kind of extrapolating from

1080
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:02,090
all those examples makes it
easier to do that, that task.

1081
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,798
- Is the prompter task
could also kind of debugging

1082
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,521
the Wolfram Language code?

1083
00:42:06,521 --> 00:42:09,826
Or is your hope to not do that debugging?

1084
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:10,660
- Oh, no. No, no.

1085
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:11,786
I mean, so, so there are many steps here.

1086
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:13,088
Yeah. Okay, so first,

1087
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:14,706
the first thing is you
type natural language,

1088
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,041
it generates Wolfram Language.

1089
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:16,875
- Do you have examples by the way?

1090
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,336
Do you have, do you have an
example that is, is it the,

1091
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,445
the dinosaur example,

1092
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:21,278
do you have an example that jumps to mind

1093
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,360
that we should be thinking about?

1094
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,471
Some dumb example.

1095
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:28,608
- It's like, take my heart
rate data and you know,

1096
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:31,191
figure out whether I, you know,

1097
00:42:32,313 --> 00:42:35,665
make a moving average every
seven days or something

1098
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:39,874
and work out what the, and and
make a a plot of the result.

1099
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:42,201
Okay. So that's a thing
which is, you know,

1100
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,530
about two-thirds of a line
of Wolfram Language code.

1101
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,586
I mean it's, you know,

1102
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:50,115
list plot of moving average
of some data bin or something

1103
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:53,451
of the, of the data and
then you'll get the result.

1104
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,660
And you know,

1105
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:56,088
the vague thing that I was just saying

1106
00:42:56,088 --> 00:42:57,804
in natural language could,

1107
00:42:57,804 --> 00:43:01,979
would almost certainly correctly
turn into that very simple

1108
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,828
piece of Wolfram Language code.

1109
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,817
- You start mumbling about heart rate.

1110
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,114
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

1111
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:09,250
- Kinda, you know,

1112
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,186
you arrive at the moving
average kind of idea.

1113
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:13,947
- Right? You say average over seven days,

1114
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:15,753
maybe it'll figure out that
that's a moving, you know,

1115
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:18,632
that that can be encapsulated
as this moving average idea.

1116
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:19,585
I'm not sure.

1117
00:43:19,585 --> 00:43:21,851
But then the typical workflow,

1118
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:24,785
but I'm seeing is you generate this piece

1119
00:43:24,784 --> 00:43:28,076
of Wolfram Language code,
it's pretty small usually.

1120
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:30,122
It's, and if it isn't small,

1121
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:31,407
it probably isn't right.

1122
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:35,032
But you know, if it's, it's
pretty small and, you know,

1123
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,422
Wolfram Language is,

1124
00:43:36,422 --> 00:43:38,335
one of the ideas of Wolfram Language is,

1125
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:40,389
it's a language that humans can read.

1126
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:41,829
It's not a language which, you know,

1127
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:44,757
programming languages tend
to be this one way story

1128
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:48,989
of humans write them and
computers execute from them.

1129
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,277
Wolfram Language is
intended to be something

1130
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:53,532
which is sort of like math
notation something where,

1131
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:54,932
you know, humans write it

1132
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,347
and humans are supposed
to read it as well.

1133
00:43:57,347 --> 00:44:00,547
And so kind of the workflow
that's emerging is kind of this,

1134
00:44:00,547 --> 00:44:03,860
this human mumbles some things, you know,

1135
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,369
large language model produces a fragment

1136
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:08,906
of Wolfram Language code.

1137
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:11,210
Then you look at that, you say, yeah,

1138
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,898
that looks well, typically
you just run it first,

1139
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,684
you see does it produce the right thing?

1140
00:44:15,684 --> 00:44:16,835
You look at what it produces.

1141
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:18,588
You might say, that's obviously crazy.

1142
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:21,523
You look at the code, you
see I see why it's crazy.

1143
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:22,634
You fix it.

1144
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:24,347
If you really care about the
results and you really wanna

1145
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:25,181
make sure it's right,

1146
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:27,523
you better look at that code
and understand it because

1147
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:30,307
that's the way you have the
sort of checkpoint of did it

1148
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:32,449
really do what I expected it to do?

1149
00:44:32,449 --> 00:44:34,840
Now you go beyond that.

1150
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,086
I mean it's, it's, it's, you know,

1151
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:37,536
what we find is, for example,

1152
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:39,686
let's say the code does the wrong thing,

1153
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:42,224
then you can often say to
the large language model,

1154
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,801
can you adjust this to do this?

1155
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,742
And it's pretty good at doing that.

1156
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:47,576
- Interesting.

1157
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:52,576
So you're using the output
of the code to give you hints

1158
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:56,358
about the, the, the function of the code.

1159
00:44:57,717 --> 00:45:02,541
So you're debugging based on
the output of the code itself.

1160
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,597
- And by the way, right,

1161
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:05,007
The plugin that we have
or the, the, you know,

1162
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:07,190
for ChatGPT, it does
that routinely, you know,

1163
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,775
it will send the thing
in, it will get a result.

1164
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,085
It will discover,

1165
00:45:12,085 --> 00:45:13,570
the LLM will discover
itself that the result

1166
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,403
is not plausible and it will
go back and say, oh, I'm sorry,

1167
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:18,634
it's very polite and it it, you know, it,

1168
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:19,530
it goes back and says,

1169
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,706
I'll rewrite that piece of
code and then it will try it

1170
00:45:21,706 --> 00:45:24,211
again and get the result.

1171
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:26,170
The other thing that's
pretty interesting is

1172
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,008
when you're just running,

1173
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,667
so one of the new concepts that we have,

1174
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:30,498
we invented this whole idea of notebooks

1175
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:32,971
back 36 years ago now.

1176
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,146
And so now there's the
question of sort of how do you

1177
00:45:35,146 --> 00:45:38,208
combine this idea of notebooks
where you have, you know,

1178
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,875
text and code and output,

1179
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,657
how do you combine that
with the notion of,

1180
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,170
of chat and so on.

1181
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,050
And there's some really
interesting things there.

1182
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:49,362
Like for example, a very typical
thing now is we have these,

1183
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:52,583
these notebooks where as soon as the, if,

1184
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,389
if the thing produces
errors, if the, you know,

1185
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:59,992
run this code and it produces
messages and so on, the, the,

1186
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:03,354
the LLM automatically not
only looks at those messages,

1187
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:06,009
it can also see all kinds of
internal information about

1188
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,755
stack traces and things like this.

1189
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:09,320
And it can then,

1190
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,055
it does a remarkably good
job of guessing what's wrong

1191
00:46:13,054 --> 00:46:14,044
and telling you.

1192
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:14,981
So in other words, it's,

1193
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,321
it's looking at things,
it's sort of interesting,

1194
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,153
it's kind of a,

1195
00:46:17,153 --> 00:46:20,246
a typical sort of AI ish thing
that it's able to have more

1196
00:46:20,246 --> 00:46:23,331
sensory data than we humans
are able to have cause able to

1197
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:25,835
look at a bunch of stuff that
we humans would kind of glaze

1198
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:27,563
over looking at.

1199
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:29,840
And it's able to then come up with,

1200
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,154
oh this is the explanation
of what's happening.

1201
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:34,530
- And, and what is the
data the stack trace, the,

1202
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,800
the code you've written previously,

1203
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,048
the natural language you've written.

1204
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:37,882
- Yeah.

1205
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,846
It's also what's happening is
one of the things that's is is

1206
00:46:40,846 --> 00:46:42,152
for example, when there's these messages,

1207
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:43,818
there's documentation
about these messages,

1208
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:45,114
there's examples of where the messages

1209
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:46,213
have occurred otherwise.

1210
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,047
- [Fridman] Nice.

1211
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:47,932
- All these kinds of things.

1212
00:46:47,932 --> 00:46:50,173
The other thing that's really
amusing with this is when it

1213
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,090
makes a mistake,

1214
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,690
one of the things that's in our
prompt when the code doesn't

1215
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,344
work is read the documentation
and we have a, you know,

1216
00:46:57,344 --> 00:47:01,748
another piece of the plugin
that lets it read documentation.

1217
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:04,916
And that again is very, very
useful because it, it will,

1218
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,215
you know, it will figure
out, sometimes it'll get,

1219
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:10,587
it'll make up the name of some
option for some function that

1220
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:11,748
doesn't really exist.

1221
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,793
Read the documentation, it'll have,

1222
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:16,583
you know, some wrong structure
for the function and so on.

1223
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,221
It's, that's a powerful thing.

1224
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:19,514
I mean the thing that, you know,

1225
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:22,539
I've realized is we built this language

1226
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,042
over the course of all
these years to be nice

1227
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,829
and coherent and consistent and so on.

1228
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:28,152
So it's easy for humans to understand.

1229
00:47:28,152 --> 00:47:30,900
Turns out there was a side
effect that I didn't anticipate,

1230
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,122
which is it makes it easier
for AIs to understand.

1231
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:36,792
- It's almost like another
natural language. But-.

1232
00:47:36,793 --> 00:47:37,900
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

1233
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,994
- So, so Wolfram language is
a kind of foreign language.

1234
00:47:40,994 --> 00:47:41,853
- [Wolfram] Yes, yes.

1235
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:43,519
- You have a lineup.

1236
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:48,322
English, French, Japanese,
Wolfram language and

1237
00:47:48,322 --> 00:47:50,063
then I don't know Spanish,

1238
00:47:50,063 --> 00:47:52,403
and then the system is not
gonna notice. Hopefully.

1239
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,335
- Well, yes, I mean maybe, you know,

1240
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:57,543
that's an interesting question because

1241
00:47:57,543 --> 00:48:00,113
it really depends on
what I see as being a,

1242
00:48:00,112 --> 00:48:03,163
a an important piece of
fundamental science that basically

1243
00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:06,577
just jumped out at us with ChatGPT.

1244
00:48:06,577 --> 00:48:07,976
Because I think, you know, the,

1245
00:48:07,976 --> 00:48:11,427
the real question is
why does ChatGPT work?

1246
00:48:11,427 --> 00:48:14,233
How is it possible to
encapsulate, you know,

1247
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:17,076
to successfully reproduce
all these kinds of things

1248
00:48:17,077 --> 00:48:20,857
in natural language, you
know, with a, you know,

1249
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,976
a comparatively small, he says, you know,

1250
00:48:22,976 --> 00:48:24,989
couple hundred billion, you know,

1251
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:27,164
weights of neural nets and so on.

1252
00:48:27,164 --> 00:48:28,034
And I think that,

1253
00:48:28,034 --> 00:48:30,085
you know, that that relates to kind of a,

1254
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:32,495
a fundamental fact about language,

1255
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,432
which, you know, the, the
main, the main thing is

1256
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,416
that I think there's a
structure to language

1257
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,113
that we haven't kind of
really explored very well.

1258
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:43,852
It's kind of this semantic
grammar I I'm talking about,

1259
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:46,143
about, about language.

1260
00:48:46,143 --> 00:48:48,293
I mean, we, we kind of know that when we,

1261
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,564
when we set up human language,

1262
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:52,542
we know that it has certain regularities.

1263
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:55,492
We know that it has a certain
grammatical structure,

1264
00:48:55,492 --> 00:48:57,432
you know, noun followed by verb,

1265
00:48:57,432 --> 00:48:59,208
followed by noun, adjectives,

1266
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,726
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1267
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:03,149
That's, its kind of grammatical structure.

1268
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,239
But I think the thing that
ChatGPT is showing us is that

1269
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,599
there's an additional kind
of regularity to language,

1270
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,721
which has to do with the
meaning of the language

1271
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,750
beyond just this pure, you know,

1272
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,429
part of speech combination type of thing.

1273
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,949
And I, I think the, the, the kind of the,

1274
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:22,670
the one example of that that
we've had in the past is logic.

1275
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,788
And you know, I, I think my,

1276
00:49:24,788 --> 00:49:29,788
my sort of kind of picture
of how was logic invented?

1277
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,601
How was logic discovered?

1278
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,039
It really was a thing that was discovered

1279
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,548
in its original conception.

1280
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,608
It was discovered presumably by Aristotle

1281
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,806
who kind of listened to a
bunch of people orators,

1282
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:42,237
you know, giving speeches.

1283
00:49:42,237 --> 00:49:45,378
And this one made sense,
that one doesn't make sense,

1284
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:50,032
this one, and you know, you see
these patterns of, you know,

1285
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:53,947
if the, you know, I don't
know what, you know, if the,

1286
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:56,678
if the Persians do this,
then the, this does that,

1287
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:58,788
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1288
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,496
And what, what Aristotle realized

1289
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:03,530
is there's a structure to those sentences,

1290
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,783
there's a structure to that
rhetoric that doesn't matter

1291
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:08,192
whether it's the Persians
and the Greeks or whether

1292
00:50:08,192 --> 00:50:09,900
it's the cats and the dogs.

1293
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,170
It's just, you know, p and q
you can abstract from this,

1294
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:16,489
the, the details of these
particular sentences.

1295
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:19,310
You can lift out this
kind of formal structure.

1296
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,719
And that's what logic is.

1297
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,552
- That's a heck of a discovery by the way.

1298
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,552
Logic, you're making me realize now.

1299
00:50:25,579 --> 00:50:26,413
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

1300
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:27,409
- It's not obvious.

1301
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:29,411
- The fact that there is an abstraction

1302
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:32,121
from natural language that has,

1303
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:34,281
where you can fill in any word you want.

1304
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,682
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1305
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:36,978
- Is a very interesting discovery.

1306
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:39,000
Now it took a long time to mature.

1307
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,407
I mean, Aristotle had this
idea of silogistic logic

1308
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,539
where there were these particular patterns

1309
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:46,909
of how you could argue
things, so to speak.

1310
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:47,858
And you know,

1311
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,476
in the Middle Ages part of education was

1312
00:50:50,476 --> 00:50:51,875
you memorized the syllogisms,

1313
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:52,934
I forget how many there were,

1314
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:54,838
but 15 of them or something.

1315
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:55,726
And they all had names,

1316
00:50:55,726 --> 00:50:56,876
they all had mnemonics.

1317
00:50:56,876 --> 00:50:59,407
Like I think Barbara and
Celarent were two of the,

1318
00:50:59,407 --> 00:51:01,365
the mnemonics for the silogisms.

1319
00:51:01,364 --> 00:51:02,646
And people would kind of,

1320
00:51:02,646 --> 00:51:04,277
this is a valid argument
because it follows

1321
00:51:04,277 --> 00:51:06,418
the Barbara of Syllogism,

1322
00:51:06,418 --> 00:51:09,737
so to speak and, and it
took until 1830, you know,

1323
00:51:09,737 --> 00:51:13,487
with George Bule to kind of
get beyond that and kind of see

1324
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,697
that there was a,

1325
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:18,057
a level of abstraction
that was beyond the,

1326
00:51:18,057 --> 00:51:21,036
this particular template
of a sentence, so to speak.

1327
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,519
And that's, you know, what,

1328
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:25,591
what's interesting there
is in a sense, you know,

1329
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:29,421
ChatGPT is operating at
the Aristotelian level.

1330
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,650
It's essentially dealing
with templates of sentences.

1331
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,312
By the time you get to
Bule and Bule and algebra

1332
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,523
and this idea of, you know,

1333
00:51:36,523 --> 00:51:39,652
you can have arbitrary depth
nested collections of ans and

1334
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:42,874
awes and knots, and you
can resolve what they mean.

1335
00:51:42,873 --> 00:51:45,679
That's the kind of thing
that's a computation story.

1336
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:46,512
That's, you know,

1337
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:49,090
you've gone beyond the pure
sort of templates of natural

1338
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,541
language to something,

1339
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,981
which is an arbitrarily deep computation.

1340
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:54,791
But the thing that I
think we realized from,

1341
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:57,030
from ChatGPT is, you know,

1342
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,474
Aristotle stopped too quickly
and there was more that you

1343
00:52:00,474 --> 00:52:04,065
could have lifted out of
language as formal structures.

1344
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:05,514
And I think there's, you know,

1345
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:08,496
in a sense we've captured
some of that in, in, you know,

1346
00:52:08,496 --> 00:52:10,978
some of what, what is in language there.

1347
00:52:10,978 --> 00:52:12,017
There's, there's a,

1348
00:52:12,016 --> 00:52:14,756
there's a lot of kind of little calculate,

1349
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,864
little algebras of, of what you can say,

1350
00:52:16,864 --> 00:52:19,115
what language talks about.

1351
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:20,026
I mean, whether it's,

1352
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:24,854
I don't know, if you say I
go from place A to place B,

1353
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:26,694
place B to place C,

1354
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:29,566
then I know I've gone
from place A to place C.

1355
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:32,402
If A is a friend of B
and B is a friend of C,

1356
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:35,224
it doesn't necessarily follow
that A is a friend of C.

1357
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:39,295
These are things that are, and
you know that there are, if,

1358
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:42,976
if you go from from place A
to place B place B to place C,

1359
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:45,284
it doesn't matter how
you went, like logic.

1360
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:48,190
It doesn't matter whether
you flew there, walked there,

1361
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,007
swam there, whatever you
still, this transitivity of,

1362
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:55,057
of where you go is still valid.

1363
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:56,290
And there are,

1364
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,539
there are many kinds of kind of features,

1365
00:52:57,539 --> 00:53:01,945
I think of the way the world
works that are captured

1366
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,986
in these aspects of, of
language, so to speak.

1367
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:07,888
And I think what, what
ChatGPT effectively has found,

1368
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,827
just like it discovered logic, you know,

1369
00:53:09,827 --> 00:53:12,170
people are really
surprised it can do these,

1370
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,327
these logical inferences.

1371
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:15,949
It discovered logic the same
way Aristotle discovered logic

1372
00:53:15,949 --> 00:53:18,927
by looking at a lot of sentences
effectively and noticing

1373
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:20,988
the patterns in those sentences.

1374
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:22,728
- But it feels like it's
discovering something much more

1375
00:53:22,728 --> 00:53:24,905
complicated than logic.

1376
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:26,945
So this kind of semantic grammar,

1377
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:28,777
I think you wrote about this,

1378
00:53:28,777 --> 00:53:32,637
maybe we can call it the laws of language,

1379
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:35,976
I believe you call, or which
I like the laws of thought.

1380
00:53:35,976 --> 00:53:36,818
- Yes.

1381
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:38,667
That was the title that
George Bule had for his,

1382
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,235
his Bule in algebra back in 1830. But yes.

1383
00:53:41,235 --> 00:53:42,387
- [Fridman] Laws of thought.

1384
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:43,986
- Yes. That was what he said.

1385
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:45,193
- [Fridman] Woo.

1386
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,096
All right.

1387
00:53:46,096 --> 00:53:46,929
- So he thought,

1388
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,568
he thought he nailed it with Bule algebra.

1389
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:49,402
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1390
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:50,646
- There's more to it.

1391
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:54,027
- I, and it's a good question,
how much more is there to it?

1392
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:56,399
And it seems like one of the reasons,

1393
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,400
as you imply that the reason
GPT works, ChatGPT works,

1394
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,927
is that there's a finite
number of things to it.

1395
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,657
- [Wolfram] Yeah. I mean, it's, it's.

1396
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:09,636
- Like, it's discovering
the laws in some sense,

1397
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:14,067
GPTs discovering this laws
of semantic grammar that

1398
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:15,592
underlies language.

1399
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:17,259
- [Wolfram] Yes. And what,

1400
00:54:17,259 --> 00:54:19,871
what's sort of interesting is
in the computational universe,

1401
00:54:19,871 --> 00:54:20,704
there's a lot of other
kinds of computation

1402
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:22,952
that you could do.

1403
00:54:22,952 --> 00:54:26,831
They're just not ones that we
humans have cared about and,

1404
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:28,751
and operate with.

1405
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:30,585
And that's probably because
our brains are built

1406
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:31,873
in a certain way.

1407
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:32,706
And, you know,

1408
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:35,195
the neural nets of our brains
are not that different in some

1409
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:37,737
sense from the neural nets of, of,

1410
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:39,290
of a large language model.

1411
00:54:39,291 --> 00:54:40,130
And that's kind of,

1412
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:42,240
and and so when we think
about, and you know,

1413
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:43,850
maybe we can talk about this some more,

1414
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:47,166
but when we think about sort
of what will AIs ultimately do,

1415
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:50,515
the answer is insofar as AI
are just doing computation,

1416
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:52,097
they can run off

1417
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:54,465
and do all these kinds
of crazy computations.

1418
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:57,446
But the ones that we sort of have,

1419
00:54:57,445 --> 00:55:00,704
have decided we care about
are there is this kind of very

1420
00:55:00,704 --> 00:55:01,704
limited set.

1421
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:05,985
- That's where the reinforcement learning

1422
00:55:05,985 --> 00:55:08,376
with human feedback seems to come in.

1423
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:11,418
The more the AI say the stuff
that kind of interests us,

1424
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:13,677
the more we're impressed by it.

1425
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,595
So they can do a lot of
interesting, intelligent things,

1426
00:55:15,594 --> 00:55:18,755
but we're only interested
in the AI systems when they

1427
00:55:18,755 --> 00:55:21,922
communicate human in a human-like way.

1428
00:55:22,898 --> 00:55:23,731
- [Wolfram] Yes.

1429
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:25,118
- About human-like topics.

1430
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:26,028
- [Wolfram] Yes.

1431
00:55:26,028 --> 00:55:27,737
- Well, it's, it's like technology.

1432
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:28,887
I mean, in a sense,

1433
00:55:28,887 --> 00:55:31,998
the physical world provides
all kinds of things.

1434
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:33,389
You know, there are all kinds of processes

1435
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:36,059
going on in physics only
a limited set of those

1436
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:39,340
are ones that we capture
and use for technology.

1437
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,760
Cause they're only a
limited set where we say,

1438
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,593
you know,

1439
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:46,119
this is a thing that we can
sort of apply to the human

1440
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,081
purposes we currently care about.

1441
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:49,148
I mean, you might have said,

1442
00:55:49,148 --> 00:55:51,110
okay, you pick up a piece of, of rock,

1443
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,600
you say, okay, there's a nice sillacate,

1444
00:55:52,601 --> 00:55:55,461
it contains all kinds of
sillicon, I don't care.

1445
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:57,972
Then you realize, oh, we could
actually turn this into a, a,

1446
00:55:57,972 --> 00:55:58,806
you know,

1447
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:01,771
semiconductor wafer and make
it microprocessor out of it,

1448
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:03,581
and then we care a lot about it.

1449
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:04,472
- [Fridman] Yes.

1450
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:05,700
- And it's, it's, you know,

1451
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,158
it's this thing about what do we,

1452
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,650
you know, in the evolution
of our civilization,

1453
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,631
what things do we identify as
being things we care about?

1454
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:13,849
I mean, it's, it's like, you know,

1455
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:16,630
when when there was a little
announcement recently of

1456
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,880
a possibility of a high
temperature superconductor that

1457
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,048
involved, you know, the element
lutetium, which, you know,

1458
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,081
generally nobody has cared about.

1459
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:24,914
- Fridman] Yes.

1460
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,310
- And, you know, it, it's kind of,

1461
00:56:26,309 --> 00:56:29,807
but suddenly if there's this
application that relates to

1462
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,820
kind of human purposes,
we start to care a lot.

1463
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:37,111
- So given your thinking
that GPT may have discovered

1464
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:42,018
inklings of laws of thought,
do you think such laws exist?

1465
00:56:42,018 --> 00:56:43,658
Can we linger on that?

1466
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:45,809
Yeah. What's your intuition here?

1467
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:46,710
- Oh, definitely.

1468
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:50,349
I mean, the fact is,
look, the, the logic is,

1469
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:51,850
but the first step,

1470
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:56,429
there are many other kinds of
calculate about things that

1471
00:56:56,429 --> 00:56:57,969
we consider, you know, the,

1472
00:56:57,969 --> 00:57:00,659
the about sort of things
that happen in the world

1473
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,760
or things that are meaningful.

1474
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,161
- Well, how do you know
logic's not the last step?

1475
00:57:05,161 --> 00:57:06,097
You know what I mean? So.

1476
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:09,259
- Well, because we can plainly
see that there thing, I mean,

1477
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,338
if, if you say,

1478
00:57:10,338 --> 00:57:14,402
here's a sentence that
is syntactically correct.

1479
00:57:14,402 --> 00:57:16,690
Okay. You look at it and
you're like, you know,

1480
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:20,090
the happy electron, you know, ate,

1481
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:24,311
I don't know what some
something that it just, it,

1482
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:26,480
you look at it and it's
like, this is meaningless.

1483
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,878
It's just a bunch of words.

1484
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:28,711
It's syntactically correct,

1485
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,262
the nouns and the verbs
are in the right place,

1486
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:34,500
but it just doesn't mean anything.

1487
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:38,313
And so there clearly is some
rules that there are rules that

1488
00:57:38,313 --> 00:57:39,943
determine when a sentence is,

1489
00:57:39,943 --> 00:57:43,273
has the potential to be
meaningful that go beyond the pure

1490
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:45,832
parts of speech syntax.

1491
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:48,031
And so the question is,
what are those rules?

1492
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:50,809
And are there a fairly
finite set of those rules?

1493
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:53,889
My guess is that there's a
fairly finite set of those rules

1494
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:56,507
and they, you know, once
you have those rules,

1495
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:59,610
you have a kind of a
construction kit, just like the,

1496
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,278
the rules of syntactic grammar
give you a construction kit

1497
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:06,128
for making syntactically
correct sentences.

1498
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:08,510
So you can also have a
construction kit for making

1499
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,978
semantically correct sentences.

1500
00:58:10,978 --> 00:58:13,489
Those sentences may not
be realized in the world.

1501
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:16,110
I mean, I think, you know,
the elephant flew to the moon.

1502
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:17,072
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1503
00:58:17,072 --> 00:58:20,081
- A syntactic, a a semantically, you know,

1504
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,789
we know we have an idea.

1505
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,939
If I say that to you, you
kind of know what that means.

1506
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:27,216
But the fact is it hasn't
been realized in the world,

1507
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:28,125
so to speak.

1508
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:31,246
- So semantically correct
perhaps as things that can be

1509
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:34,447
imagined with a human mind, no.

1510
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:39,447
Things that are consistent
with both our imagination

1511
00:58:39,454 --> 00:58:42,405
and our understanding of physical reality.

1512
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:43,693
I don't know.

1513
00:58:43,693 --> 00:58:44,526
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

1514
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:46,437
It's a good question. I
mean, it's a good question.

1515
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:47,824
It it, it's a good question.

1516
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:48,972
I mean, I think it is,

1517
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:52,813
it is given the way we
have constructed language,

1518
00:58:52,813 --> 00:58:54,534
it is things which,

1519
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,794
which fit with the things
we're describing in language.

1520
00:58:57,793 --> 00:59:01,241
It's a bit circular in the end
because, you know, you can,

1521
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:02,882
and, and the, and the,

1522
00:59:02,882 --> 00:59:07,063
the sort of boundaries of
what is physically realizable.

1523
00:59:07,063 --> 00:59:09,313
Okay, let, let's take
the example of motion.

1524
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,931
Okay? Motion is a complicated concept.

1525
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:13,574
It might seem like it's a
concept that should have been

1526
00:59:13,574 --> 00:59:16,355
figured out by the Greeks,
you know, long ago.

1527
00:59:16,355 --> 00:59:18,753
But it's actually a really
pretty complicated concept

1528
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,001
because what is motion?

1529
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:23,202
Motion is you can go from place
A to place B and it's still

1530
00:59:23,202 --> 00:59:26,613
you when you get to the other end, right?

1531
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:28,530
You, you take an object, you move it,

1532
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,612
and it's still the same object,

1533
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:32,333
but it's in a different place.

1534
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,162
Now, even in ordinary physics,

1535
00:59:34,161 --> 00:59:36,161
that doesn't always work that way.

1536
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:38,393
If you're near a space time
singularity in a black hole,

1537
00:59:38,393 --> 00:59:41,522
for example, and you take
your teapot or something,

1538
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:43,642
you don't have much of
a teapot by the time

1539
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,492
it's near the space time singularity.

1540
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:46,961
It's been completely, you know,

1541
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:49,219
deformed beyond recognition.

1542
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,920
But, so that's a case where
pure motion doesn't really work.

1543
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,300
You can't have a, a thing stay the same.

1544
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,451
But, so this idea of motion is,

1545
00:59:57,452 --> 00:59:59,260
is something that sort of is a,

1546
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,100
is a slightly complicated idea.

1547
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:04,411
But once you have the idea
of motion, you can start,

1548
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:06,980
once you have the idea that
you're gonna describe things as

1549
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,001
being the same thing,
but in a different place,

1550
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:14,001
that sort of abstracted
idea then has, you know,

1551
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,431
that has all sorts of consequences.

1552
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:19,309
Like this transitivity of
motion go from A to B, B to C.

1553
01:00:19,309 --> 01:00:21,081
You've gone from A to C.

1554
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:23,391
And that's so that level of description,

1555
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:28,192
you can have what are sort
of inevitable consequences.

1556
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:29,775
They're inevitable features of the way

1557
01:00:29,775 --> 01:00:30,858
you've sort of set things up.

1558
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:33,470
And that's, I think what
this sort of semantic grammar

1559
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:36,536
is capturing is things, things like that.

1560
01:00:36,536 --> 01:00:37,451
And I, you know,

1561
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:39,920
I think that it's a question
of what does the word mean when

1562
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,699
you say I go from, I
move from here to there.

1563
01:00:42,699 --> 01:00:44,641
Well, it's complicated
to say what that means.

1564
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,081
This is this whole issue of, you know,

1565
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:48,572
is pure motion possible, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1566
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:51,289
But once you have kind of got
an idea of what that means,

1567
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:56,018
then there are inevitable
consequences of that idea.

1568
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,050
- But the very idea of meaning,

1569
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,800
it seems like there's
some words that become,

1570
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:07,009
it's like there's a
latent ambiguity to them.

1571
01:01:07,009 --> 01:01:09,349
I mean, it is the word like emotionally

1572
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:12,807
loaded words like hate and love, right?

1573
01:01:12,807 --> 01:01:15,429
It's like, what, what do
they, what do they mean?

1574
01:01:15,429 --> 01:01:17,028
Exactly? What, what?

1575
01:01:17,028 --> 01:01:19,331
So especially when you
have relationships between

1576
01:01:19,331 --> 01:01:22,800
complicated objects, we seem
to take this kind of shortcut,

1577
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,731
descriptive shortcut of,

1578
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:28,670
to describe like object
A hates object B, what's,

1579
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,150
what's that really mean?

1580
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,213
- [Wolfram] Right.

1581
01:01:31,213 --> 01:01:35,981
Well, words are defined by
kind of our social use of them.

1582
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:37,012
I mean, it's not, you know,

1583
01:01:37,012 --> 01:01:40,733
a word in computational
language, for example,

1584
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:44,876
when we say we have a, a construct there,

1585
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:48,239
we expect that that construct
is a building block from which

1586
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,088
we can construct an arbitrary tall tower.

1587
01:01:51,088 --> 01:01:53,329
So we have to have a very
solid building block.

1588
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:55,828
And you know, we have to, it
turns into a piece of code,

1589
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:58,197
it has documentation, it's,
you know, it's a whole,

1590
01:01:58,197 --> 01:01:59,909
it's a whole thing.

1591
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:01,876
But the word hate, you know,

1592
01:02:01,876 --> 01:02:04,527
the documentation for that word.

1593
01:02:04,527 --> 01:02:06,996
Well, there isn't a standard
documentation for that word,

1594
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:08,393
so to speak.

1595
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:11,527
It's a complicated thing
defined by kind of how we use it

1596
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,057
when, you know,

1597
01:02:13,057 --> 01:02:15,550
if it wasn't for the fact
that we were using language,

1598
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,969
I mean, so, so what is
language at some level,

1599
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:20,737
language is a way of packaging
thoughts so that we can

1600
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,195
communicate them to another mind.

1601
01:02:23,195 --> 01:02:26,228
- Can these complicated words be converted

1602
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:30,155
into something that a
computation engine can use?

1603
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:32,858
- Right? So, so I think
the answer to that is that,

1604
01:02:32,858 --> 01:02:37,818
that what one can do in
computational language is define,

1605
01:02:37,818 --> 01:02:40,326
make a def- make a specific definition.

1606
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:42,954
And if you have a complicated word,

1607
01:02:42,954 --> 01:02:44,819
like let's say the word eat, okay,

1608
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,818
you'd think that's a simple word.

1609
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:49,056
It's, you know, animals
eat things, whatever else.

1610
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,217
But you know, you do programming,

1611
01:02:50,217 --> 01:02:53,927
you say this function eats arguments,

1612
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:56,127
which is sort of poetically similar

1613
01:02:56,128 --> 01:02:58,117
to the animal eating things.

1614
01:02:58,117 --> 01:02:59,509
But if you start to say, well,

1615
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,155
what are the implications of, you know,

1616
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:04,716
the function eating something,
you know, does it can,

1617
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:07,146
can the function be poisoned?
Well, maybe it can actually,

1618
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:10,126
but you know, if there's a tight
mismatch or something in a,

1619
01:03:10,126 --> 01:03:11,518
in some language.

1620
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:12,906
But, but you know, in what,

1621
01:03:12,907 --> 01:03:15,537
how far does that
analogy go? And it, it's,

1622
01:03:15,536 --> 01:03:17,556
it's just an analogy. Yeah.

1623
01:03:17,556 --> 01:03:21,930
Whereas if you use the word
eat in a computational language

1624
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,358
level, you would define there
isn't a thing which you,

1625
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:29,170
you anchor to the kind of
natural language concept eat.

1626
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,827
But it is now some precise
definition of that,

1627
01:03:31,827 --> 01:03:33,648
that then you can compute things from.

1628
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:35,659
- But don't you think the
analogy is also precise software

1629
01:03:35,659 --> 01:03:37,327
eats the world, huh?

1630
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,911
Don't, don't you think there's,

1631
01:03:40,876 --> 01:03:43,084
there is something concrete in terms of

1632
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,839
meaning about analogies.

1633
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,159
- Sure.

1634
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,757
But the thing that sort
of is the first target for

1635
01:03:48,757 --> 01:03:53,005
computational language is
to take sort of the ordinary

1636
01:03:53,005 --> 01:03:55,676
meaning of things and
try and make it precise,

1637
01:03:55,677 --> 01:03:57,496
make it sufficiently precise.

1638
01:03:57,496 --> 01:03:59,807
You can build these towers
of computation on top of it.

1639
01:03:59,806 --> 01:04:00,639
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1640
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:02,722
- So it's kinda like if you
start with a piece of poetry

1641
01:04:02,722 --> 01:04:04,192
and you say,

1642
01:04:04,193 --> 01:04:06,998
I'm going to define my program
with this piece of poetry.

1643
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:10,389
It's kind of like, that's,
that's a difficult thing.

1644
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,518
It's better to say,

1645
01:04:11,518 --> 01:04:13,947
I'm gonna just have this
boring piece of prose

1646
01:04:13,947 --> 01:04:16,077
and it's using words in the ordinary way.

1647
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:16,910
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1648
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:19,504
- And that's how I'm
communicating with my computer.

1649
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:22,177
And that's how I'm going to
build the solid building block

1650
01:04:22,177 --> 01:04:24,433
from which I can construct
this whole kind of

1651
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:25,545
computational tower.

1652
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:28,085
- So there is some sense
where if you take a poem

1653
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:29,985
and reduce it to something computable,

1654
01:04:29,985 --> 01:04:31,835
you're gonna have very few things left.

1655
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:35,215
So maybe there's a bunch of
human interaction that's just

1656
01:04:35,215 --> 01:04:37,215
poetic aimless nonsense.

1657
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:39,855
- [Wolfram] Well.

1658
01:04:39,855 --> 01:04:43,824
- That's just like recreational,
like hamster in a wheel.

1659
01:04:43,824 --> 01:04:46,306
It's not actually producing anything.

1660
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:47,139
- Well, I, I I,

1661
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:49,664
I think that that's a complicated
thing because in a sense,

1662
01:04:49,664 --> 01:04:52,985
human linguistic communication
is, there's one mind,

1663
01:04:52,985 --> 01:04:56,415
it's producing language
that language is having

1664
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,856
an effect on another mind.

1665
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:58,689
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1666
01:04:58,688 --> 01:05:01,085
- And the question of
there's sort of a, a,

1667
01:05:01,085 --> 01:05:05,224
a type of effect that is well
defined, let's say where,

1668
01:05:05,224 --> 01:05:06,057
where, for example,

1669
01:05:06,057 --> 01:05:08,717
it's very independent of the
two minds that the, it doesn't,

1670
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:09,706
you know, there, there,

1671
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:12,376
there's communication where it
can matter a lot sort of what

1672
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,414
the experience of, of,

1673
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:18,081
of one mind is versus
another one and so on.

1674
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,490
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1675
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:26,490
But what is the purpose of
natural language communication?

1676
01:05:26,905 --> 01:05:28,956
- [Wolfram] I think, I think the-

1677
01:05:28,956 --> 01:05:30,826
- Versus, so computation
computational language

1678
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,666
somehow feels more amenable
to the definition of purpose.

1679
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:35,499
It's like, yeah,

1680
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:40,307
you're given two clean
representations of a concept

1681
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:41,141
and you can build a tower based on that.

1682
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,978
- [Wolfram] Right.

1683
01:05:42,978 --> 01:05:46,349
- Is natural language the same
thing but more fuzzy or what?

1684
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:48,773
- Well, I think the, the story
of natural language, right?

1685
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:51,452
And the, the, that's the great
invention of our species.

1686
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:54,189
We don't know whether it
exists in other species,

1687
01:05:54,188 --> 01:05:56,022
but we know it exists in our species.

1688
01:05:56,023 --> 01:06:00,338
It's the thing that allows
you to sort of communicate

1689
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:02,748
abstractly from like one generation

1690
01:06:02,748 --> 01:06:04,452
of the species to another.

1691
01:06:04,452 --> 01:06:05,285
You can, you know,

1692
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:07,230
there is an abstract version of knowledge

1693
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,452
that can be passed down.

1694
01:06:08,452 --> 01:06:10,521
It doesn't have to be, you know, genetics.

1695
01:06:10,521 --> 01:06:12,240
It doesn't have to be, you know,

1696
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:14,459
you don't have to apprentice
the next species, you know,

1697
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,898
the next generation of birds
to the previous one to show

1698
01:06:16,898 --> 01:06:18,811
them how something works.

1699
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:19,644
- [Fridman] Yeah.

1700
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,950
- There is this abstracted
version of knowledge that can be

1701
01:06:21,951 --> 01:06:23,329
kind of passed down.

1702
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:26,211
Now that, you know, it relies on,

1703
01:06:26,211 --> 01:06:29,242
it still tends to rely
because language is fuzzy.

1704
01:06:29,242 --> 01:06:31,340
It does tend to rely on
the fact that, you know,

1705
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:34,951
if we look at the, you know,
some ancient language that,

1706
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:37,391
where we don't have a chain
of translations from it until

1707
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:39,043
what we have today,

1708
01:06:39,043 --> 01:06:41,510
we may not understand
that ancient language.

1709
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:43,130
And we may not understand, you know,

1710
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,971
its concepts may be different

1711
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:46,318
from the ones that we have today.

1712
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,210
We still have to have
something of a chain.

1713
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,831
But it is something where we
can realistically expect to

1714
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:53,423
communicate abstract ideas.

1715
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:56,110
And that's, you know, that's
one of the big, big roles of,

1716
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,985
of a language I think, you know, in, in,

1717
01:06:59,985 --> 01:07:02,947
it's, you know, and that that's been this,

1718
01:07:02,947 --> 01:07:07,530
this ability to sort of
concrete-ify abstract things is

1719
01:07:08,686 --> 01:07:11,277
what, what language has provided.

1720
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,967
- Do you see natural language
and thought as the same,

1721
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:17,264
the stuff that's going inside your mind?

1722
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:20,625
- Well, that's been a
long debate in philosophy.

1723
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,407
- It seems to be become more important now

1724
01:07:22,407 --> 01:07:25,990
when we think about
how intelligent GPT is.

1725
01:07:28,014 --> 01:07:29,155
- [Wolfram] Whatever that means.

1726
01:07:29,155 --> 01:07:30,047
- Whatever that means.

1727
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,677
But it seems like the stuff
that's going on in the human

1728
01:07:31,677 --> 01:07:34,409
mind seems something like intelligence.

1729
01:07:34,409 --> 01:07:35,242
- [Wolfram] Yes.

1730
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:36,101
- And is the language-

1731
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:37,373
- Well, we call it intelligence.

1732
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:38,206
Yeah.

1733
01:07:38,206 --> 01:07:39,276
- We call it. Well, yes.

1734
01:07:39,275 --> 01:07:40,982
- And so you, you start to think of, okay,

1735
01:07:40,983 --> 01:07:43,561
what's the relationship between thought,

1736
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:45,269
the language of thought,
the laws of thought,

1737
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:47,987
the laws of the words like reasoning

1738
01:07:47,987 --> 01:07:49,987
and the laws of language

1739
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,579
and how that has to do with computation,

1740
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:57,787
which seems like more rigorous,
precise ways of reasoning.

1741
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:58,848
- [Wolfram] Right.

1742
01:07:58,849 --> 01:07:59,856
Which are beyond human. I mean,

1743
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:03,148
much of what computers
do, humans do not do.

1744
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:04,688
I mean, you, you might say-

1745
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:06,329
- Humans are a subset.

1746
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:07,567
- [Wolfram[ Yes.
- [Fridman] Presumably.

1747
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:08,894
- [Wolfram] Yes.
- [Fridman] Hopefully.

1748
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:09,728
- [Wolfram] Yes.

1749
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:10,748
The, the yes.

1750
01:08:10,748 --> 01:08:12,242
Right. You know, you might say,

1751
01:08:12,242 --> 01:08:14,199
who needs computation when we have large,

1752
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:15,753
large language models?

1753
01:08:15,753 --> 01:08:17,179
Large language models can just, you know,

1754
01:08:17,179 --> 01:08:18,577
eventually you'll have
a big enough NeuroNet

1755
01:08:18,577 --> 01:08:19,681
can do anything,

1756
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,898
but they're really doing
the kinds of things

1757
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:23,579
that humans quickly do.

1758
01:08:23,578 --> 01:08:25,738
And there're plenty of sort
of formal things that humans

1759
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,778
never quickly do.

1760
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:30,119
For example, I don't know, I, you know,

1761
01:08:30,118 --> 01:08:32,019
you can, some people can
do mental arithmetic.

1762
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,509
They can do a certain
amount of math in their,

1763
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:34,560
in their minds.

1764
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,520
I don't think many people can
run a program in their minds

1765
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,299
of any sophistication.

1766
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:41,319
It's just not something people do.

1767
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,688
It's not something people
have even thought of doing.

1768
01:08:43,688 --> 01:08:46,680
Cause it just, it's kind of
a, it's kind of not, you know,

1769
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,497
you can easily run it on a computer.

1770
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:50,349
- We're an arbitrary program.
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

1771
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:52,929
- Aren't we running specialized programs?

1772
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:53,761
- [Wolfram] Yeah, yeah.

1773
01:08:53,761 --> 01:08:54,594
But if I say to you-

1774
01:08:54,595 --> 01:08:55,427
- Run this program-

1775
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:56,400
- [Wolfram] Here's a
touring machine. Yeah.

1776
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,162
You know, tell me what
it does after 50 steps.

1777
01:08:59,162 --> 01:09:01,472
And you're like, trying to
think about that in your mind.

1778
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:04,564
That's really hard to do.
It's not what people do.

1779
01:09:04,564 --> 01:09:05,396
I mean it-

1780
01:09:05,396 --> 01:09:06,229
- [Fridman] Well, in some sense,

1781
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:10,782
people program, they build
a computer, they program it.

1782
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,836
Just to answer your question
about what the system does

1783
01:09:13,836 --> 01:09:15,027
after 50 steps.

1784
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:16,422
I mean, humans build computers.

1785
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:17,254
- Yes.

1786
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:18,551
Yes, yes, that's right.

1787
01:09:18,551 --> 01:09:21,491
But they've created something
which is then, you know,

1788
01:09:21,492 --> 01:09:23,458
then when they run it,

1789
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,541
it's doing something different

1790
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:27,021
than what's happening in their minds.

1791
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,180
I mean, they've outsourced that,

1792
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,092
that piece of computation
from something that is in

1793
01:09:32,092 --> 01:09:35,211
internally happening in their
minds to something that is now

1794
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,310
a tool that's external to their minds.

1795
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:38,143
- [Fridman] So by the way,

1796
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:40,863
humans to you didn't invent computers.

1797
01:09:40,863 --> 01:09:43,021
They discovered them.

1798
01:09:43,021 --> 01:09:45,019
- They discovered computation.

1799
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,853
- [Fridman] Which-

1800
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:49,520
- They invented the
technology of computers.

1801
01:09:52,882 --> 01:09:55,179
- This, the computer is just a kind of way

1802
01:09:55,179 --> 01:09:56,931
to plug into this whole,

1803
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:58,748
this stream of computation.

1804
01:09:58,748 --> 01:09:59,680
There's probably other,

1805
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,513
are other ways.

1806
01:10:00,514 --> 01:10:01,599
There's probably a lot of ways.

1807
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:03,279
- [Wolfram] For sure. I
mean the, the, you know,

1808
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:05,218
the particular ways that
we make computers out of

1809
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:07,438
semiconductors and electronics and so on.

1810
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,782
That's the particular
technology stack we've built.

1811
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:12,381
I mean, the story of a
lot of what people try

1812
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:14,733
to do with quantum computing
is finding different

1813
01:10:14,733 --> 01:10:16,663
sort of underlying physical,

1814
01:10:16,662 --> 01:10:19,782
you know, infrastructure
for doing computation.

1815
01:10:19,783 --> 01:10:22,381
You know, biology does
lots of computation.

1816
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:24,601
It does it using an infrastructure
that's different from

1817
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,632
semiconductors and electronics.

1818
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:28,853
It's a, you know, it's a molecular scale,

1819
01:10:28,853 --> 01:10:32,051
sort of computational
process that hopefully we'll

1820
01:10:32,051 --> 01:10:33,612
understand more about.

1821
01:10:33,613 --> 01:10:36,243
I have some ideas about
understanding more about that.

1822
01:10:36,243 --> 01:10:38,791
But you know, that's a,
that's another ins you know,

1823
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,110
it's another representation
of computation,

1824
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:43,762
things that happen in the
physical universe at the level of,

1825
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:46,122
you know, these evolving
hypergraphs and so on.

1826
01:10:46,122 --> 01:10:49,873
That's another sort of
implementation layer for this

1827
01:10:49,873 --> 01:10:52,372
abstract idea of computation.

1828
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:56,853
- So if GPT or large language
models are starting to form,

1829
01:10:56,854 --> 01:11:00,903
starting to develop or
implicitly understand the laws

1830
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,471
of language and thought,

1831
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:04,870
do you think they can be made explicit?

1832
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:05,922
- [Wolfram] Yes.

1833
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:06,754
- How.

1834
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,591
- [Wolfram] With a bunch of effort?

1835
01:11:09,591 --> 01:11:10,630
- [Fridman] I mean, so do, do they have-

1836
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:11,692
- It's like doing natural science.

1837
01:11:11,692 --> 01:11:13,658
I mean, what is happening
in natural science?

1838
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:16,000
You have the world that's doing
all these complicated things

1839
01:11:16,001 --> 01:11:19,109
and then you discover, you know,
Newton's laws, for example.

1840
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,360
This is how motion works.

1841
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,387
This is the way that this particular

1842
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,256
sort of idealization of the world,

1843
01:11:24,256 --> 01:11:26,463
this is how we describe it in a simple

1844
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,154
computation reducible way.

1845
01:11:28,154 --> 01:11:30,064
And I think it's the same thing here.

1846
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:34,105
It's, there are sort of
computationally reducible aspects of

1847
01:11:34,105 --> 01:11:37,462
what's happening that you can
get a kind of narrative theory

1848
01:11:37,462 --> 01:11:39,603
for just as we've got narrative theories

1849
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:41,353
in physics and so on.

1850
01:11:44,957 --> 01:11:48,577
- Do you think it will
be depressing or exciting

1851
01:11:48,577 --> 01:11:52,056
when all the laws of
thought are made explicit

1852
01:11:52,056 --> 01:11:54,735
human thought are made explicit?

1853
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:56,546
- I think that once you understand

1854
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:58,467
computational reducibility,

1855
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:01,492
it is, it's neither of those things.

1856
01:12:01,493 --> 01:12:05,077
Because the fact is people say
for example, people will say,

1857
01:12:05,077 --> 01:12:10,077
oh, but you know, I have free
will I, I kind of, you know,

1858
01:12:10,106 --> 01:12:14,118
I operate in a way that is,
you know, you, you, they,

1859
01:12:14,118 --> 01:12:18,465
they have the idea that they're
doing something that is sort

1860
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:21,537
of, of internal to them, that
they're figuring out what's,

1861
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,488
what's happening.

1862
01:12:23,488 --> 01:12:24,320
But in fact,

1863
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,466
we think there are laws
of physics that ultimately

1864
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:29,545
determine, you know, every,
every nerve, you know,

1865
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,796
every electrical impulse and
a nerve and things like this.

1866
01:12:32,796 --> 01:12:33,969
So you might say,

1867
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:37,777
isn't it depressing that we
are ultimately just determined

1868
01:12:37,777 --> 01:12:40,067
by the rules of physics, so to speak?

1869
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:42,797
It's the same thing.
It's at a higher level.

1870
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:44,184
It's like, it's, it's,

1871
01:12:44,185 --> 01:12:48,278
it's a shorter distance to get
from kind of semantic grammar

1872
01:12:48,278 --> 01:12:51,847
to the way that we might
construct a piece of text than it

1873
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:54,305
is to get from individual nerve firings

1874
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:56,685
to how we construct a piece of text.

1875
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,485
But it's not fundamentally different.

1876
01:12:58,485 --> 01:13:01,466
And by the way, as soon as we
have this kind of level of,

1877
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:04,348
you know, this other level
of description, it's kind of,

1878
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:05,965
it helps us to go even further.

1879
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,988
So we'll end up being able
to produce more and more

1880
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:12,586
complicated kinds of kinds of
things that just like when we,

1881
01:13:12,586 --> 01:13:14,295
you know, if we didn't have a computer

1882
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:15,685
and we knew certain rules,

1883
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:16,518
we could write them down.

1884
01:13:16,519 --> 01:13:17,824
We go a certain distance.

1885
01:13:17,824 --> 01:13:20,323
But once we have a computer,
we can go vastly further.

1886
01:13:20,323 --> 01:13:22,393
And this is the same kind of thing.

1887
01:13:22,393 --> 01:13:23,565
- You wrote a blog post titled,

1888
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,972
what is ChatGPT doing
and why does it work?

1889
01:13:26,972 --> 01:13:27,860
We've been talking about this,

1890
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,024
but can we just step back
and linger on this question?

1891
01:13:31,024 --> 01:13:33,703
What, what's it, what's ChatGPT doing?

1892
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:34,644
What, what are these,

1893
01:13:34,645 --> 01:13:37,062
A bunch of billion parameters

1894
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:42,403
trained on a large number of words.

1895
01:13:42,403 --> 01:13:45,871
Like, why does it seem to work again?

1896
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:46,703
Is it,

1897
01:13:46,703 --> 01:13:49,150
is it because to the point
you made that there's

1898
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:53,032
laws of language that can be
discovered by such a process?

1899
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:53,882
Is there something-?

1900
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:54,981
- Well, let, let's,

1901
01:13:54,981 --> 01:13:56,935
let's talk about sort of the low level

1902
01:13:56,935 --> 01:13:58,104
of what ChatGPT is doing.

1903
01:13:58,104 --> 01:14:00,748
I mean, ultimately you give it a prompt.

1904
01:14:00,747 --> 01:14:02,515
It's trying to work out, you know,

1905
01:14:02,515 --> 01:14:04,346
what should the next word be?

1906
01:14:04,346 --> 01:14:06,195
- Right. Which is wild.

1907
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:07,576
Isn't that,

1908
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:11,016
isn't that surprising to you
that this kind of low level

1909
01:14:11,016 --> 01:14:14,684
dumb training procedure
can create something

1910
01:14:16,113 --> 01:14:17,954
syntactically correct first

1911
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,971
and then semantically correct second.

1912
01:14:19,971 --> 01:14:20,923
- [Wolfram] You know,

1913
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,764
the thing that has been sort
of a story of my life is

1914
01:14:22,764 --> 01:14:26,984
realizing that simple rules
can do much more complicated

1915
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:28,817
things than you imagine.

1916
01:14:28,817 --> 01:14:30,480
That something that starts simple

1917
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,201
and starts simple to describe

1918
01:14:32,202 --> 01:14:34,635
can grow a thing that is, you know,

1919
01:14:34,635 --> 01:14:37,972
vastly more complicated
than you can imagine.

1920
01:14:37,971 --> 01:14:40,965
And, and honestly, it, it's
taken me, I mean, I don't know,

1921
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:43,426
I've sort of been thinking
about this now 40 years or so,

1922
01:14:43,426 --> 01:14:45,885
and it always surprises me.
I mean, even for example,

1923
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:47,016
in our physics project,

1924
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:49,195
sort of thinking about the whole
universe growing from these

1925
01:14:49,195 --> 01:14:52,697
simple rules, I still resist
because I keep on thinking,

1926
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:53,529
you know,

1927
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,112
how can something really complicated

1928
01:14:55,113 --> 01:14:56,806
arise from something that simple?

1929
01:14:56,805 --> 01:15:01,805
It just seems, you know, it
seems wrong, but yet, you know,

1930
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:04,353
the majority of my life,
I've kind of known from,

1931
01:15:04,353 --> 01:15:06,724
from things I've studied, that
this is the way things work.

1932
01:15:06,724 --> 01:15:07,556
So yes, I,

1933
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:10,813
it is wild that it's possible
to write a word at a time

1934
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:13,443
and produce a coherent essay, for example.

1935
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:15,413
But it's worth understanding
kind of how that's working.

1936
01:15:15,413 --> 01:15:18,194
I mean, it's kind of like,
if, if it was going to say,

1937
01:15:18,194 --> 01:15:22,414
you know, the cat sat on
the, what's the next word?

1938
01:15:22,414 --> 01:15:24,694
Okay, so how does it
figure out the next word?

1939
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:27,233
Well, it's seen a trillion
words written on the internet,

1940
01:15:27,233 --> 01:15:30,574
and it's seen the cat sat on the floor,

1941
01:15:30,573 --> 01:15:35,214
the cat sat on the sofa,
the cat sat on the whatever.

1942
01:15:35,215 --> 01:15:37,913
So it's minimal thing to do is just say,

1943
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:40,122
let's look at what we saw on the internet.

1944
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:44,722
We saw, you know, 10,000
examples of the cat sat on the,

1945
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:47,403
what was the most probable next word.

1946
01:15:47,403 --> 01:15:50,552
Let's just pick that out and
say that's the next word.

1947
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:51,384
And that's,

1948
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:54,730
that's kind of what it at
some level is trying to do.

1949
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:56,599
Now, the problem is
there isn't enough text

1950
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,260
on the internet to, for,

1951
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,570
if you have a reasonable
length of prompt to that,

1952
01:16:02,569 --> 01:16:04,308
that that specific prompt will never

1953
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,798
have occurred on the internet.

1954
01:16:05,798 --> 01:16:08,269
And as you, as you kind of go further,

1955
01:16:08,269 --> 01:16:11,181
there just won't be a place
where you could have trained,

1956
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:12,840
you know, where you could just,

1957
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:16,091
just worked out probabilities
from what was already there.

1958
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:17,970
You know, like if you say two plus two,

1959
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,302
there'll be a zillion examples

1960
01:16:19,302 --> 01:16:21,466
of two plus two equaling four,

1961
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:22,871
and a very small number of examples of

1962
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:25,336
two plus two equals five and so on.

1963
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:27,306
And you can pretty much
know what's going to happen.

1964
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:28,554
So then the question is, well,

1965
01:16:28,555 --> 01:16:31,875
if you can't just work out from examples,

1966
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,454
what's gonna happen? Just
no probabilistic for,

1967
01:16:34,454 --> 01:16:37,284
for examples, what's gonna
happen, you have to have a model.

1968
01:16:37,284 --> 01:16:38,257
And this kind of an idea,

1969
01:16:38,257 --> 01:16:42,327
this idea of making models of
things is an idea that really,

1970
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:43,159
I don't know,

1971
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:45,206
I think Galileo probably was
one of the first people who

1972
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:46,773
sort of worked this out.

1973
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,163
I mean, it's kind of like, like,

1974
01:16:48,163 --> 01:16:50,666
you know, I think I
gave an example of that,

1975
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:53,493
the little book I wrote
about, about ChatGPT

1976
01:16:53,493 --> 01:16:54,963
where it's kind of like, you know,

1977
01:16:54,963 --> 01:16:57,213
Galileo was dropping cannon balls off the,

1978
01:16:57,213 --> 01:17:00,243
off the different floors of
the, of the tower of Piza.

1979
01:17:00,243 --> 01:17:02,931
And it's like, okay, you drop
a cannonball off this floor,

1980
01:17:02,931 --> 01:17:04,684
you drop a cannonball off this floor,

1981
01:17:04,685 --> 01:17:07,724
you miss floor five or
something for whatever reason.

1982
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:08,556
But you know,

1983
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,663
the time it took the cannon
ball to fall to the ground from

1984
01:17:10,663 --> 01:17:13,136
floors one, two, three, four,

1985
01:17:13,136 --> 01:17:15,293
six, seven, eight, for example.

1986
01:17:15,293 --> 01:17:17,376
Then the question is, can
you work out, can you,

1987
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:20,097
can you make a model
which figures out how long

1988
01:17:20,096 --> 01:17:21,237
did it take the ball?

1989
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,454
How long would it have take
the ball to fall to the ground

1990
01:17:23,454 --> 01:17:25,844
from the floor you didn't
explicitly measure.

1991
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:29,336
And the thing Galileo realized
is that you can use math,

1992
01:17:29,336 --> 01:17:32,815
you can use mathematical
formulas to make a model for how

1993
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,755
long it will take the ball to fall.

1994
01:17:35,756 --> 01:17:37,204
So now the question is, well, okay,

1995
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:39,734
you want to make a model for, for example,

1996
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:41,934
something much more elaborate,

1997
01:17:41,935 --> 01:17:45,427
like you've got this arrangement
of pixels and is this

1998
01:17:45,426 --> 01:17:47,597
arrangement of pixels an A or a B?

1999
01:17:47,597 --> 01:17:49,305
Does it correspond to
something we'd recognize

2000
01:17:49,305 --> 01:17:50,482
as an A or a B?

2001
01:17:50,483 --> 01:17:52,425
And you can make a similar kind, you know,

2002
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:55,494
each pixel is like a
parameter in some equation.

2003
01:17:55,494 --> 01:17:57,974
And you could write down
this giant equation where the

2004
01:17:57,974 --> 01:17:59,974
answer is either, you know, A or you know,

2005
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:01,576
one or two A or B.

2006
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:05,756
And the question is then what
kind of a model successfully

2007
01:18:05,756 --> 01:18:09,146
reproduces the way that we humans would,

2008
01:18:09,145 --> 01:18:12,596
would conclude that this is an
A, and this is a B, you know,

2009
01:18:12,596 --> 01:18:13,429
if if there's a,

2010
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,385
a complicated extra tail
on the top of the A,

2011
01:18:16,385 --> 01:18:18,414
would we then conclude
something different?

2012
01:18:18,413 --> 01:18:22,175
What is the type of model that
maps well into the way that

2013
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:24,596
we humans make distinctions about things?

2014
01:18:24,595 --> 01:18:27,218
And the big kind of meta discovery

2015
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:29,251
is neural nets are such a model.

2016
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,163
It's not obvious they
would be such a model.

2017
01:18:31,163 --> 01:18:34,783
It could be that human
distinctions are not captured.

2018
01:18:34,783 --> 01:18:35,616
You know,

2019
01:18:35,617 --> 01:18:37,323
we could try searching
around for a type of model

2020
01:18:37,323 --> 01:18:39,204
that could be a mathematical model,

2021
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:41,662
it could be some model based
on something else that captures

2022
01:18:41,662 --> 01:18:44,634
kind of typical human
distinctions about things.

2023
01:18:44,635 --> 01:18:48,684
It turns out this model that
actually is very much the way

2024
01:18:48,684 --> 01:18:51,530
that we think the
architecture of brains works,

2025
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:53,685
that perhaps, not surprisingly,

2026
01:18:53,685 --> 01:18:56,033
that model actually corresponds to the way

2027
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:57,635
we make these distinctions.

2028
01:18:57,635 --> 01:18:59,074
And so, you know, the, the,

2029
01:18:59,074 --> 01:19:01,594
the core next point is that
the, the kind of model,

2030
01:19:01,594 --> 01:19:05,634
this neural net model
makes sort of distinctions

2031
01:19:05,634 --> 01:19:08,930
and generalizes things
in sort of the same way

2032
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:10,631
that we humans do it.

2033
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:12,451
And that's why when you say, you know,

2034
01:19:12,452 --> 01:19:15,034
the cat sat on the green blank,

2035
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,512
even though it never didn't see
many examples of the cat sat

2036
01:19:18,512 --> 01:19:21,871
on the green, whatever, it can make a,

2037
01:19:21,871 --> 01:19:24,663
or the aardvark sat on
the green, whatever.

2038
01:19:24,662 --> 01:19:27,181
I'm sure that particular sentence

2039
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:28,751
does not occur on the internet.

2040
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:31,803
And so it has to make a
model that concludes what,

2041
01:19:31,802 --> 01:19:34,702
you know, it has to kind of
generalize from what it's,

2042
01:19:34,702 --> 01:19:37,112
from the actual examples that it's seen.

2043
01:19:37,112 --> 01:19:40,643
And so, so you know that that's
the factors that neural nets

2044
01:19:40,643 --> 01:19:44,654
generalized in the same kind
of a way that we humans do.

2045
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:45,986
If, if we were, you know,

2046
01:19:45,985 --> 01:19:49,046
the aliens might look at our
neural net generalizations and

2047
01:19:49,046 --> 01:19:50,195
say, that's crazy.

2048
01:19:50,194 --> 01:19:51,027
You know,

2049
01:19:51,028 --> 01:19:53,985
that thing when you put that
extra little dot on the A,

2050
01:19:53,985 --> 01:19:55,953
that isn't an A anymore. That's, you know,

2051
01:19:55,953 --> 01:19:57,905
that messed the whole thing up.

2052
01:19:57,905 --> 01:20:00,564
But for us humans, we make distinctions,

2053
01:20:00,564 --> 01:20:02,854
which seem to correspond to
the kinds of distinctions

2054
01:20:02,854 --> 01:20:04,273
that neural nets make.

2055
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:05,414
So then, you know, the,

2056
01:20:05,413 --> 01:20:08,292
the thing that is just
amazing to me about ChatGPT

2057
01:20:08,292 --> 01:20:12,271
is how similar the structure
it has is to the very

2058
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:14,506
original way people imagine
neural nets might work

2059
01:20:14,506 --> 01:20:15,588
back in 1943.

2060
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,574
And, you know, there's a
lot of detailed engineering,

2061
01:20:19,574 --> 01:20:22,845
you know, great cleverness,
but it's really the same idea.

2062
01:20:22,845 --> 01:20:23,678
And in fact,

2063
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,692
even the sort of elaboration
of that idea where people said,

2064
01:20:26,692 --> 01:20:29,774
let's put in some actual
particular structure to try and

2065
01:20:29,774 --> 01:20:31,405
make the neural net more elaborate,

2066
01:20:31,404 --> 01:20:34,565
to be very clever about it,
most of that didn't matter.

2067
01:20:34,565 --> 01:20:36,126
I mean, there's some things
that seem to, you know,

2068
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:39,265
when you, when you train
this neural net, you know,

2069
01:20:39,265 --> 01:20:41,686
the one thing, this kind of
transformer architecture,

2070
01:20:41,685 --> 01:20:44,496
this attention idea that
really has to do with,

2071
01:20:44,496 --> 01:20:47,966
does every one of these
neurons connect to every other

2072
01:20:47,966 --> 01:20:52,105
neuron or is it somehow
causally localized, so to speak?

2073
01:20:52,105 --> 01:20:52,938
Does it, like,

2074
01:20:52,939 --> 01:20:55,853
we're making a sequence of
words and the words depend on

2075
01:20:55,853 --> 01:20:58,335
previous words rather than just,

2076
01:20:58,335 --> 01:21:00,154
everything can depend on everything.

2077
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:01,545
And that seems to be important.

2078
01:21:01,545 --> 01:21:04,087
And just organizing things
so that you don't have a,

2079
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:06,006
a sort of a giant mess.

2080
01:21:06,006 --> 01:21:06,838
But the thing, you know,

2081
01:21:06,838 --> 01:21:09,046
the thing worth understanding about

2082
01:21:09,046 --> 01:21:10,294
what is ChatGPT in the end?

2083
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:11,435
I mean, what is a neural net in the end?

2084
01:21:11,435 --> 01:21:15,606
A neural net in the end is
each neuron has a, it, it,

2085
01:21:15,606 --> 01:21:18,555
it's taking inputs from
a bunch of other neurons.

2086
01:21:18,555 --> 01:21:21,185
It's, it's, eventually
it's going to have a,

2087
01:21:21,185 --> 01:21:23,556
it's going to have a, a numerical value.

2088
01:21:23,556 --> 01:21:25,728
It's going to compute some number.

2089
01:21:25,728 --> 01:21:27,737
And it's, it's saying,
I'm gonna look at the,

2090
01:21:27,737 --> 01:21:29,886
the neurons above me.

2091
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:31,715
It's kind of a, a series of layers.

2092
01:21:31,716 --> 01:21:33,376
It's gonna look at the neurons above me

2093
01:21:33,376 --> 01:21:34,398
and it's going to say,

2094
01:21:34,398 --> 01:21:36,173
what are the values of all those neurons?

2095
01:21:36,173 --> 01:21:38,247
Then it's gonna add those
up and multiply them

2096
01:21:38,247 --> 01:21:39,466
by these weights,

2097
01:21:39,466 --> 01:21:41,637
and then it's going to apply
some function that says

2098
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,755
if it's bigger than zero or something,

2099
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:46,025
then make it one or, and
otherwise make it zero

2100
01:21:46,024 --> 01:21:48,436
or some slightly more
complicated function.

2101
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,466
You know very well how this works.

2102
01:21:50,466 --> 01:21:54,355
- It's a giant equation
with a lot of variables.

2103
01:21:54,354 --> 01:21:57,054
You mentioned figuring out
where the ball falls when you

2104
01:21:57,055 --> 01:21:58,825
don't have data on the fourth floor.

2105
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:02,492
This, the equation here
is not as simple as-

2106
01:22:04,395 --> 01:22:07,335
- [Wolfram] It's an equation
with 175 billion terms.

2107
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:10,605
- And it's quite surprising
that in some sense,

2108
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:15,523
a simple procedure of training
such an equation can lead to

2109
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,682
- [Wolfram] Well I think-

2110
01:22:18,682 --> 01:22:20,283
- A good representation
of natural language.

2111
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:22,330
- Right? The, the real issue is, you know,

2112
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:24,351
this architecture of a neural net where,

2113
01:22:24,351 --> 01:22:27,673
where what's happening is,
you know, you've, you've,

2114
01:22:27,673 --> 01:22:31,363
you've turned so neural nets
always just deal with numbers.

2115
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,196
And so, you know,

2116
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,063
you've turned the sentence
that you started with into a

2117
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:34,913
bunch of numbers.

2118
01:22:34,912 --> 01:22:36,471
Like let's say by mapping, you know,

2119
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:38,623
each word of the 50,000 words in English,

2120
01:22:38,623 --> 01:22:40,706
you just map each word
or each part of a word

2121
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:41,983
into some number.

2122
01:22:41,983 --> 01:22:43,623
You feed all those numbers in,

2123
01:22:43,622 --> 01:22:46,371
and then the thing is going to,

2124
01:22:46,372 --> 01:22:48,829
and then those numbers
just go into the values

2125
01:22:48,829 --> 01:22:50,009
of these neurons.

2126
01:22:50,009 --> 01:22:53,305
And then what happens is it's
just rippling down going layer

2127
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,729
to layer until it gets to the end.

2128
01:22:55,729 --> 01:22:58,933
I think ChatGPT has about
400 layers, and you're just,

2129
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:01,076
you know, it just goes once through it.

2130
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:04,262
Just, every, every new word
it's gonna compute just says,

2131
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:06,774
here are the, here are the
numbers from the words before,

2132
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,133
let's compute the, what is it compute.

2133
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:12,354
It computes the probabilities
that it estimates for each of

2134
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:15,036
the possible 50,000 words
that could come next.

2135
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,295
And then it decides sometimes it will use

2136
01:23:17,295 --> 01:23:18,505
the most probable word.

2137
01:23:18,505 --> 01:23:20,644
Sometimes it will use not
the most probable word.

2138
01:23:20,644 --> 01:23:23,114
It's an interesting fact
that there's this so-called

2139
01:23:23,113 --> 01:23:26,114
temperature parameter, which,
you know, at temperature zero,

2140
01:23:26,114 --> 01:23:29,824
it's always using the most
probable word that it, that it

2141
01:23:29,824 --> 01:23:32,520
estimated was the, the most
probable thing to come next.

2142
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:33,920
You know, if you increase the temperature,

2143
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,127
it'll be more and more kind of random

2144
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:37,123
in its selection of words.

2145
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:39,197
It'll go down to the lower
and lower priority words.

2146
01:23:39,197 --> 01:23:41,774
The thing I was just playing
with actually recently was the

2147
01:23:41,774 --> 01:23:44,044
transition that happens as
you increase the temperature,

2148
01:23:44,043 --> 01:23:47,237
the thing goes bonkers at
a particular, you know,

2149
01:23:47,237 --> 01:23:49,444
sometimes at a particular temperature.

2150
01:23:49,444 --> 01:23:52,893
I think maybe about 1.2 is
the thing I was noticing from

2151
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,373
yesterday actually.

2152
01:23:54,373 --> 01:23:55,603
That, you know,

2153
01:23:55,604 --> 01:23:57,845
usually it's giving reasonable
answers and then at that

2154
01:23:57,845 --> 01:24:01,395
temperature with some probability,

2155
01:24:01,395 --> 01:24:03,845
it just starts spouting nonsense.

2156
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:07,136
And, you know, nobody
knows why this happens.

2157
01:24:07,136 --> 01:24:10,895
I mean, it's, it's,
and by the way, I mean,

2158
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:11,954
the thing to understand is it's

2159
01:24:11,953 --> 01:24:13,974
putting down one word at a time,

2160
01:24:13,974 --> 01:24:17,195
but the outer loop of the
fact that it says, okay,

2161
01:24:17,195 --> 01:24:18,583
I put down a word.

2162
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:20,533
Now let's take the whole
thing I wrote so far,

2163
01:24:20,533 --> 01:24:22,054
let's feed that back in.

2164
01:24:22,055 --> 01:24:23,454
Let's put down another word.

2165
01:24:23,453 --> 01:24:25,604
That outer loop, which
seems almost trivial,

2166
01:24:25,604 --> 01:24:28,425
is really important to the
operation of the thing.

2167
01:24:28,426 --> 01:24:29,305
And, and for example,

2168
01:24:29,305 --> 01:24:32,693
one of the things that is
kind of funky is it'll give an

2169
01:24:32,693 --> 01:24:36,335
answer and you say to it,
is that answer correct?

2170
01:24:36,335 --> 01:24:37,752
And it'll say no.

2171
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:40,085
And why is that happening?

2172
01:24:40,085 --> 01:24:40,917
- [Fridman] It's fascinating. Right?

2173
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:41,750
- Right. Why can't it do that?

2174
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:43,121
Well, the answer is because it,

2175
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:45,753
it is going one word at
a time sort of forwards.

2176
01:24:45,753 --> 01:24:47,543
And it didn't, you know, it it,

2177
01:24:47,543 --> 01:24:50,041
it came along with some sort of chain of,

2178
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,731
of thought in a sense, and it,

2179
01:24:51,731 --> 01:24:54,381
it came up with completely
the wrong answer.

2180
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,891
But as soon as you feed it,

2181
01:24:55,891 --> 01:24:58,733
the whole thing that it came up with,

2182
01:24:58,733 --> 01:25:01,282
it immediately knows
that that isn't right.

2183
01:25:01,282 --> 01:25:03,554
It immediately can recognize
that was a, you know,

2184
01:25:03,554 --> 01:25:07,132
a bad syllogism or something,
and can see what happened.

2185
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:09,811
Even though as it was being
led down this garden path,

2186
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:12,961
so to speak, it didn't, it
came to the wrong place.

2187
01:25:12,961 --> 01:25:15,512
- But it's fascinating that
this kind of procedure converges

2188
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:19,511
to something that forms
a pretty good compressed

2189
01:25:20,492 --> 01:25:23,501
representation of
language on the internet.

2190
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:24,730
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

2191
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:26,181
- That, that's quite.

2192
01:25:26,181 --> 01:25:27,972
- [Wolfram] Right. Right, right.

2193
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:29,693
- I'm not sure what to make of it.

2194
01:25:29,693 --> 01:25:30,759
- Well, look, I think, you know,

2195
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,699
there are many things we
don't understand. Okay.

2196
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:36,632
So for example, you know,
175 billion weights,

2197
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,961
it's maybe about a trillion
bites of information,

2198
01:25:38,961 --> 01:25:43,323
which is very comparable to
the training set that was used.

2199
01:25:43,323 --> 01:25:46,073
And you know, why that, why kind,

2200
01:25:47,194 --> 01:25:50,232
it sort of stands to some kind
of reason that the number of

2201
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,362
weights in the neural
net, I don't know where,

2202
01:25:52,362 --> 01:25:55,002
I can't really argue that I
can't really give you a good,

2203
01:25:55,002 --> 01:25:58,970
you know, in a sense the
very fact that, you know,

2204
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:01,681
the insofar as there are definite
rules of what's going on,

2205
01:26:01,681 --> 01:26:05,063
you might expect that eventually
we'll have a much smaller

2206
01:26:05,063 --> 01:26:08,844
neural net that will successfully
capture what's happening.

2207
01:26:08,844 --> 01:26:10,377
I, I don't think the best way to do it

2208
01:26:10,377 --> 01:26:12,069
is probably a neural net.

2209
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:14,426
I think a neural net is what
you do when you don't know any

2210
01:26:14,426 --> 01:26:16,242
other way to structure the thing.

2211
01:26:16,242 --> 01:26:18,078
And it's a very good thing to
do if you don't know any other

2212
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:19,614
way to structure the thing.

2213
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:20,737
And for the last 2000 years,

2214
01:26:20,738 --> 01:26:22,653
we haven't known any
other way to structure it.

2215
01:26:22,653 --> 01:26:24,601
So this is a pretty good way to start.

2216
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,505
But that doesn't mean you
can't find sort of, in a sense,

2217
01:26:27,506 --> 01:26:30,859
more symbolic rules for
what's going on that you know,

2218
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:32,819
much of which will then be,

2219
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:35,843
you can kind of get rid of
much of the structure of the

2220
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:39,639
neural net and replace it by
things which are sort of pure

2221
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:42,104
steps of computation, so to speak,

2222
01:26:42,104 --> 01:26:44,842
sort of with neural net
stuff around the edges.

2223
01:26:44,842 --> 01:26:46,390
And that becomes just a, you know,

2224
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:48,105
it's just a much simpler way to do it.

2225
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:52,805
- So the neural net you hope
will reveal to us good symbolic

2226
01:26:52,805 --> 01:26:56,218
rules that make the
needs of the neural net

2227
01:26:56,219 --> 01:26:57,752
less and less and less.

2228
01:26:57,752 --> 01:26:58,585
- Right.

2229
01:26:58,585 --> 01:27:01,149
And there will still be some
stuff that's kind of fuzzy,

2230
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,515
just like, you know, there
there're things that it,

2231
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:05,695
it's like this question
of what can we formalize,

2232
01:27:05,695 --> 01:27:08,170
what can we turn into
computational language?

2233
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,887
What is just sort of, oh,

2234
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:14,440
it happens that way just because
brains are set up that way.

2235
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,755
- What do you think are the
limitations of large language

2236
01:27:17,756 --> 01:27:20,460
models just to make it explicit?

2237
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,296
- Well, I mean,

2238
01:27:21,296 --> 01:27:22,988
I think that deep computation
is not what large language

2239
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:24,894
models do. I mean, that's just,

2240
01:27:24,894 --> 01:27:26,806
it's a different kind of thing, you know,

2241
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:28,987
the outer loop of a large language model.

2242
01:27:28,987 --> 01:27:31,556
If, if you are trying to do
many steps in a computation,

2243
01:27:31,556 --> 01:27:34,484
the only way you get to do
that right now is by spooling

2244
01:27:34,484 --> 01:27:36,014
out, you know, all the,

2245
01:27:36,015 --> 01:27:39,316
the whole chain of thought as
a bunch of words basically.

2246
01:27:39,315 --> 01:27:40,301
And, you know,

2247
01:27:40,301 --> 01:27:42,891
you can make a touring machine
out of that if you want to.

2248
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:45,474
I just was make doing that
construction, you know,

2249
01:27:45,475 --> 01:27:48,294
in principle you can make
an arbitrary computation

2250
01:27:48,293 --> 01:27:50,353
by just spooling out the words.

2251
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:51,185
But it's an,

2252
01:27:51,185 --> 01:27:53,804
it's a bizarre and
inefficient way to do it.

2253
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:58,517
But it's something where the,
you know, I, I think that's,

2254
01:27:58,516 --> 01:28:03,034
you know, sort of the, the
deep computation is it's,

2255
01:28:03,034 --> 01:28:06,699
it's really what a humans can do quickly.

2256
01:28:06,699 --> 01:28:10,722
Large language models will
probably be able to do well.

2257
01:28:10,722 --> 01:28:12,957
Anything that you can do kind
of off the top of your head

2258
01:28:12,957 --> 01:28:15,333
type thing is a, is really, you know,

2259
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:18,171
is good for large language
models and the things you do off

2260
01:28:18,171 --> 01:28:20,259
the top of your head, you may
not get them always right,

2261
01:28:20,259 --> 01:28:23,217
but you know, you'll, it, it's,

2262
01:28:23,217 --> 01:28:26,168
it's thinking it through
the same way we do.

2263
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:28,619
- But I wonder if there's an
automated way to do something

2264
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:33,261
that humans do well much
faster to where it like loops.

2265
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:38,261
So generate arbitrary large
code bases off Wolfram Language

2266
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:39,876
for example.

2267
01:28:39,876 --> 01:28:40,954
- [Wolfram] Well, the
question is what does he,

2268
01:28:40,954 --> 01:28:43,219
what do you want the code base to do?

2269
01:28:43,219 --> 01:28:46,636
- Escape control and take over the world?

2270
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:49,773
- [Wolfram] Okay, so, you know,

2271
01:28:49,774 --> 01:28:52,315
the thing is when people say, you know,

2272
01:28:52,314 --> 01:28:55,820
we, we want to build
this giant thing, right?

2273
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:58,899
A giant piece of computational
language in a sense,

2274
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:02,216
it's sort of a failure
of computational language

2275
01:29:02,216 --> 01:29:03,752
if the thing you have to
build, in other words,

2276
01:29:03,752 --> 01:29:05,283
if we have a description, if,

2277
01:29:05,283 --> 01:29:07,276
if you have a small description,

2278
01:29:07,275 --> 01:29:10,110
that's the thing that you
represent in computational

2279
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:14,260
language and then the computer
can compute from that.

2280
01:29:14,261 --> 01:29:15,458
- [Fridman] Yes.

2281
01:29:15,457 --> 01:29:17,282
- So in a sense in, you know, when,

2282
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:20,208
as soon as you're giving a
description, the, you know,

2283
01:29:20,207 --> 01:29:23,310
if you have to somehow make
that description something,

2284
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:27,157
you know, definite something
formal and once and,

2285
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:28,988
and to say, to say, okay,

2286
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:31,960
I'm gonna give this
piece of natural language

2287
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,125
and then it's gonna split out this giant

2288
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:37,184
formal structure that
in a sense that doesn't,

2289
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:40,945
that that doesn't really make
sense because except insofar

2290
01:29:40,944 --> 01:29:44,146
as that piece of natural language
kind of plugs into what we

2291
01:29:44,146 --> 01:29:46,095
socially know, so to speak,

2292
01:29:46,095 --> 01:29:49,702
plugs into kind of our corpus
of knowledge, then, you know,

2293
01:29:49,702 --> 01:29:51,173
that's a way we are
capturing a piece of that

2294
01:29:51,173 --> 01:29:52,055
corpus of knowledge.

2295
01:29:52,055 --> 01:29:53,914
But hopefully we will have
done that in computational

2296
01:29:53,913 --> 01:29:57,081
language. How do you make
it do something that's big?

2297
01:29:57,081 --> 01:29:58,699
Well, you know,

2298
01:29:58,698 --> 01:30:00,643
you have to have a way to
describe what you want.

2299
01:30:00,644 --> 01:30:02,658
- Okay. I can make it
more explicit if you want.

2300
01:30:02,658 --> 01:30:05,231
How about I just pop into my head,

2301
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:08,814
iterate through all
the members of Congress

2302
01:30:09,939 --> 01:30:12,789
and figure out how to convince them

2303
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:14,872
that they have to let me,

2304
01:30:18,555 --> 01:30:21,218
the meaning the system become president,

2305
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:24,715
pass all the laws that allows
AI systems to take control and

2306
01:30:24,715 --> 01:30:26,078
be the president. I don't know.

2307
01:30:26,078 --> 01:30:28,569
So that's a very explicit
like figure out the individual

2308
01:30:28,569 --> 01:30:32,955
life story of each congressman
that each senator, anybody,

2309
01:30:32,954 --> 01:30:33,787
I don't know,

2310
01:30:33,787 --> 01:30:36,575
what's required to really
kind of pass legislation and

2311
01:30:36,576 --> 01:30:40,426
figure out how to control them
and manipulate them, right.

2312
01:30:40,426 --> 01:30:41,569
Get all the information.

2313
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:45,190
What would be the biggest
fear of this congressman?

2314
01:30:45,189 --> 01:30:49,378
And in such a way that you
can take action on it in the

2315
01:30:49,378 --> 01:30:51,163
digital space.

2316
01:30:51,163 --> 01:30:53,318
So maybe threaten the
destruction reputation

2317
01:30:53,319 --> 01:30:54,835
or something like this.

2318
01:30:54,835 --> 01:30:57,511
- Right. If I can describe what I want.

2319
01:30:57,511 --> 01:30:58,730
You know,

2320
01:30:58,729 --> 01:31:01,541
to what extent can a large
language model automate that?

2321
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:04,900
- Would the help with the
help of the conqurization

2322
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:07,274
of something like Wolfram language

2323
01:31:07,274 --> 01:31:10,107
that makes it more yeah, grounded.

2324
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,793
- [Wolfram] I think it
can go rather a long way.

2325
01:31:12,793 --> 01:31:15,695
- I'm also surprised how
quickly I was able to generate.

2326
01:31:15,695 --> 01:31:17,362
- Yeah, yeah. Right.

2327
01:31:17,362 --> 01:31:18,221
- [Wolfram] That's a, an attack.

2328
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:21,343
- That, that's a, you know, I, I swear,

2329
01:31:21,344 --> 01:31:23,204
I swear I did not think about
this before and it's funny how

2330
01:31:23,204 --> 01:31:25,800
quickly, which is a very
concerning thing because that,

2331
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:27,847
that probably this idea will
probably do quite a bit of

2332
01:31:27,847 --> 01:31:28,680
damage and there might
be a very large number

2333
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,347
of other such ideas.

2334
01:31:32,556 --> 01:31:33,389
- Well, I'll give you a,

2335
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,306
a much more benign version of that idea.

2336
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:38,577
Okay. You're gonna make an AI
tutoring system and you know,

2337
01:31:38,578 --> 01:31:40,516
that is a, that's a,

2338
01:31:40,515 --> 01:31:44,277
a benign version of what you're
saying is I want this person

2339
01:31:44,277 --> 01:31:46,346
to understand this point.

2340
01:31:46,345 --> 01:31:47,178
You know,

2341
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:50,050
you are essentially doing
machine learning where the,

2342
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:52,217
where the, where the, you know,
the, the loss function, the,

2343
01:31:52,217 --> 01:31:54,407
the thing you're trying to
get to is get the human to

2344
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:56,003
understand this point and,

2345
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:58,523
and when you do a test on
the human that they yes,

2346
01:31:58,523 --> 01:32:01,262
they correctly understand
how this or that works.

2347
01:32:01,262 --> 01:32:04,345
And I, I am confident that, you know,

2348
01:32:05,297 --> 01:32:08,423
sort of a large language model
type technology combined with

2349
01:32:08,423 --> 01:32:11,304
computational language is
going to be able to do pretty,

2350
01:32:11,304 --> 01:32:15,387
pretty well at teaching us humans things.

2351
01:32:15,387 --> 01:32:17,814
And it's gonna be an
interesting phenomenon because,

2352
01:32:17,814 --> 01:32:21,435
you know, sort of
individualized teaching is,

2353
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,724
is a thing that has been
kind of a, you know,

2354
01:32:23,724 --> 01:32:25,470
a goal for a long time.

2355
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:27,682
I think we're gonna get that
and I think more, you know,

2356
01:32:27,682 --> 01:32:30,876
that, that it has many
consequences for, you know, like,

2357
01:32:30,876 --> 01:32:34,560
like just, you know, if
you know me as an, if you,

2358
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,803
the AI know me, tell me
I'm about to do this thing,

2359
01:32:38,802 --> 01:32:41,434
what is the, what are the
three things I need to know,

2360
01:32:41,434 --> 01:32:45,636
you know, given what I already
know, you know, what's the,

2361
01:32:45,636 --> 01:32:46,910
what's, let's say I'm,

2362
01:32:46,909 --> 01:32:50,079
I'm looking at some paper
or something, right?

2363
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,699
it's like there's a version
of the summary of that paper

2364
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:56,076
that is optimized for me, so to speak,

2365
01:32:56,076 --> 01:32:58,307
and where it really is.

2366
01:32:58,307 --> 01:33:00,266
And I think that's really going to work.

2367
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:03,127
- It could understand the
major gaps in your knowledge

2368
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:03,960
- [Wolfram] Yes.

2369
01:33:03,961 --> 01:33:05,733
- That if filled would actually give you

2370
01:33:05,733 --> 01:33:09,038
a deeper understanding of the topic.

2371
01:33:09,037 --> 01:33:10,068
- [Wolfram] Yeah. Right.

2372
01:33:10,069 --> 01:33:11,325
And that's a, you know,

2373
01:33:11,324 --> 01:33:12,471
that's an important thing because it,

2374
01:33:12,471 --> 01:33:14,670
it really changes actually.
I think, you know, when,

2375
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,384
when you think about education and so on,

2376
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:19,396
it really changes kind
of what's worth doing,

2377
01:33:19,396 --> 01:33:20,940
what's not worth doing and so on.

2378
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:21,853
It makes, you know,

2379
01:33:21,854 --> 01:33:24,449
I know in my life I've learned
lots of different fields and

2380
01:33:24,449 --> 01:33:27,001
you know, so I, yeah, I don't know.

2381
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:27,904
I have every time,

2382
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:29,928
I'm always think this is
the one that's going to,

2383
01:33:29,927 --> 01:33:31,610
I'm not gonna be able to learn.

2384
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,900
But turns out sort of,

2385
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,391
there are sort of meta
methods for learning

2386
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:36,485
these things in the end.

2387
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:38,398
And, you know, I think this,

2388
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:42,380
this idea that it becomes
easier to, you know, it,

2389
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:45,132
it becomes easier to be
fed knowledge, so to speak.

2390
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:46,887
And it becomes, you know,

2391
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:49,454
if you need to know this
particular thing, you can,

2392
01:33:49,454 --> 01:33:52,909
you know, you can get taught it in a,

2393
01:33:52,909 --> 01:33:55,844
in an efficient way is something
I think is sort of a, a,

2394
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:57,056
an interesting feature.

2395
01:33:57,056 --> 01:34:00,060
And I think it makes the, you know,

2396
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:01,765
things like the value of,

2397
01:34:01,765 --> 01:34:05,913
of big towers of specialized
knowledge become less

2398
01:34:05,913 --> 01:34:10,753
significant compared to the
kind of meta knowledge of sort

2399
01:34:10,753 --> 01:34:13,537
of understanding kind of the,

2400
01:34:13,537 --> 01:34:15,561
the big picture and being able
to connect things together.

2401
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:17,761
I think that, you know, there's
been this huge trend of,

2402
01:34:17,761 --> 01:34:20,201
of let's be more and more
specialized because we have to,

2403
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:21,739
you know, we,

2404
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,127
we have to sort of ascend
these towers of knowledge,

2405
01:34:24,127 --> 01:34:26,480
but by the time you can get, you know,

2406
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,188
more automation of being able
to get to that place on the

2407
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:32,972
tower without having to go
through all those steps,

2408
01:34:32,971 --> 01:34:35,104
I think it, it sort of
changes that picture.

2409
01:34:35,104 --> 01:34:35,937
- Interesting.

2410
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:40,121
So your intuition is that
in terms of the, the,

2411
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:41,826
the collective intelligence
of the species and the

2412
01:34:41,826 --> 01:34:44,389
individual minds that
make up that collective,

2413
01:34:44,389 --> 01:34:45,806
there'll be more,

2414
01:34:46,872 --> 01:34:50,372
there will trend towards being generalists

2415
01:34:51,286 --> 01:34:53,989
and being kind of philosophers.

2416
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:54,822
- That's what I think,

2417
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:56,796
I think that's where the
humans are gonna be useful.

2418
01:34:56,796 --> 01:35:01,796
I think that a lot of these
kind of the drilling, the, the,

2419
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,356
the, the mechanical working out of things

2420
01:35:04,356 --> 01:35:06,426
is much more automatable.

2421
01:35:06,426 --> 01:35:09,395
It's much more AI, AI
territory, so to speak.

2422
01:35:09,395 --> 01:35:11,551
- [Fridman] No more PhDs.

2423
01:35:11,551 --> 01:35:14,213
- Well that's, it's interesting.

2424
01:35:14,212 --> 01:35:15,454
Yes. I mean that, you know, the, the,

2425
01:35:15,454 --> 01:35:17,037
the kind of the specialization,

2426
01:35:17,037 --> 01:35:18,591
this kind of tower of specialization,

2427
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:20,880
which has been a feature of, you know,

2428
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,958
we've accumulated lots
of knowledge in our,

2429
01:35:22,957 --> 01:35:27,666
in our species and, and you
know, in a sense, every time we,

2430
01:35:27,667 --> 01:35:30,340
every time we have an
a kind of automation,

2431
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,865
a building of tools,

2432
01:35:31,865 --> 01:35:34,724
it becomes less necessary
to know that whole tower.

2433
01:35:34,724 --> 01:35:36,863
And it becomes something where
you can just use a tool to

2434
01:35:36,863 --> 01:35:38,555
get to the top of that tower.

2435
01:35:38,555 --> 01:35:42,319
I think that, you know, the
thing that is ultimately,

2436
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,912
you know, when we think about, okay,

2437
01:35:43,912 --> 01:35:46,619
what do the AIs do versus
what do the humans do?

2438
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:48,751
It's like AIs you tell 'em,

2439
01:35:48,752 --> 01:35:51,086
you say go achieve this
particular objective.

2440
01:35:51,086 --> 01:35:52,130
Okay?

2441
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:54,913
They can maybe figure out a
way to achieve that objective.

2442
01:35:54,913 --> 01:35:57,398
We say, what objective
would you like to achieve?

2443
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:00,917
The AI has no intrinsic idea of that.

2444
01:36:00,917 --> 01:36:02,625
It's not a defined thing.

2445
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:06,925
That's a thing which has to
come from some other, you know,

2446
01:36:06,925 --> 01:36:07,757
some other entity.

2447
01:36:07,757 --> 01:36:09,619
And insofar as we are in charge,

2448
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:11,391
so to speak, or whatever it is,

2449
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:15,417
and our kind of web of society
and history and so on is the

2450
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:19,497
thing that is defining what
objective we want to go to.

2451
01:36:19,497 --> 01:36:20,631
That's, you know, that that's,

2452
01:36:20,631 --> 01:36:25,631
that's a thing that we humans
are necessarily involved in.

2453
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:27,333
- To push back a little bit,

2454
01:36:27,332 --> 01:36:30,832
don't you think that GPT,
feature versions of GPT would

2455
01:36:30,832 --> 01:36:34,328
be able to give a good answer
to what objective would you

2456
01:36:34,328 --> 01:36:35,661
like to achieve.

2457
01:36:37,068 --> 01:36:40,028
- From on what basis? I
mean, if they say, look,

2458
01:36:40,028 --> 01:36:41,985
here's the terrible thing
that could happen. Okay,

2459
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:44,944
they're taking the average
of the internet and they're

2460
01:36:44,944 --> 01:36:47,817
saying, you know, from the
average of the internet,

2461
01:36:47,818 --> 01:36:49,456
what do people want to do?

2462
01:36:49,456 --> 01:36:50,346
- Well, that's the,

2463
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:53,711
the Elon Musk artage of the
most entertaining outcome is

2464
01:36:53,712 --> 01:36:55,045
the most likely.

2465
01:36:56,167 --> 01:36:57,265
- [Wolfram] Okay.

2466
01:36:57,265 --> 01:36:59,037
That could be got that one from him. Yeah.

2467
01:36:59,037 --> 01:37:04,037
- That could be, that could
be one objective is maximize

2468
01:37:04,372 --> 01:37:06,122
global entertainment.

2469
01:37:08,884 --> 01:37:11,057
The dark version of that is drama.

2470
01:37:11,057 --> 01:37:13,689
The, the, the good version of that is fun.

2471
01:37:13,689 --> 01:37:17,418
- Right. So I mean this, this
question of what, you know,

2472
01:37:17,417 --> 01:37:20,000
if you say to the AI, you know,

2473
01:37:21,993 --> 01:37:24,951
what does the species want to achieve?

2474
01:37:24,951 --> 01:37:25,899
- [Fridman] Yes. Okay.

2475
01:37:25,899 --> 01:37:27,680
There'll be an answer. Right?

2476
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,894
- There'll be an answer.

2477
01:37:28,895 --> 01:37:30,842
It'll be what the average of
the internet says the species

2478
01:37:30,841 --> 01:37:32,371
wants to achieve.

2479
01:37:32,372 --> 01:37:34,657
- Well, well, let's, let's, let's,

2480
01:37:34,657 --> 01:37:36,712
I think you're using the word
average very loosely there,

2481
01:37:36,712 --> 01:37:37,724
- [Wolfram] I am.

2482
01:37:37,725 --> 01:37:39,142
- So I think you,

2483
01:37:40,729 --> 01:37:43,149
I think the answers will become
more and more interesting as

2484
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:46,160
these language models are
trained better and better.

2485
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:46,992
- No, but I mean,

2486
01:37:46,993 --> 01:37:49,451
in the end it's a reflection back

2487
01:37:49,451 --> 01:37:51,176
of what we've already said.

2488
01:37:51,176 --> 01:37:52,027
- Yes.

2489
01:37:52,027 --> 01:37:52,907
But it's,

2490
01:37:52,907 --> 01:37:55,899
there's a deeper wisdom to
the collective intelligence,

2491
01:37:55,899 --> 01:37:58,178
presumably than each individual.

2492
01:37:58,177 --> 01:37:59,010
- [Wolfram] Maybe.

2493
01:37:59,011 --> 01:38:03,268
- Isn't that what we're
trying to, as society?

2494
01:38:03,268 --> 01:38:05,094
- [Wolfram] To, to have,
well, I mean that's, that's a,

2495
01:38:05,094 --> 01:38:07,680
that's an important No, no,
this is an interesting question.

2496
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,703
I mean, in, you know, insofar
as some of us, you know,

2497
01:38:10,703 --> 01:38:13,079
work on trying to innovate and
figure out new things and so

2498
01:38:13,078 --> 01:38:15,552
on, it is sometimes it's a,

2499
01:38:15,552 --> 01:38:18,823
it's a complicated interplay
between sort of the individual

2500
01:38:18,823 --> 01:38:22,450
doing the crazy thing, often
some, some spur, so to speak,

2501
01:38:22,449 --> 01:38:26,918
versus the collective that's
trying to do sort of the, the,

2502
01:38:26,918 --> 01:38:29,844
the, the high inertia average thing.

2503
01:38:29,844 --> 01:38:33,506
And it's, you know, sometimes
the collective, you know, is,

2504
01:38:33,506 --> 01:38:36,600
is bubbling up things that
are interesting and sometimes

2505
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:39,844
it's pulling down kind of the
attempt to make this kind of

2506
01:38:39,844 --> 01:38:41,369
innovative direction.

2507
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:42,202
- Well,

2508
01:38:42,203 --> 01:38:44,320
don't you think the large
language models would see beyond

2509
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:45,430
that simplification?

2510
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:48,613
We'll say maybe intellectual
and career diversity

2511
01:38:48,613 --> 01:38:49,542
is really important.

2512
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,783
So you need the crazy
people on the outlier,

2513
01:38:51,783 --> 01:38:53,595
on the outskirts, right?

2514
01:38:53,595 --> 01:38:55,883
And so, like the actual,

2515
01:38:55,884 --> 01:39:00,884
what's the purpose of this whole
thing is to explore through

2516
01:39:00,985 --> 01:39:04,036
this kind of dynamics that
we've been using as a human

2517
01:39:04,036 --> 01:39:06,355
civilization, which is most
of us focus on one thing,

2518
01:39:06,355 --> 01:39:08,631
and then there's the crazy
people on the outskirts doing the

2519
01:39:08,631 --> 01:39:10,625
opposite of that one thing.

2520
01:39:10,625 --> 01:39:13,570
And you kind of like pull
the whole society together.

2521
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:16,265
There's the mainstream science
and then there's the crazy

2522
01:39:16,265 --> 01:39:18,498
science, and that's just been the,

2523
01:39:18,498 --> 01:39:20,578
the history of human civilization.

2524
01:39:20,578 --> 01:39:22,733
And maybe the AI system
will be able to see that.

2525
01:39:22,734 --> 01:39:26,374
And the more and more impressed
we are by a language model

2526
01:39:26,373 --> 01:39:27,605
telling us this,

2527
01:39:27,605 --> 01:39:31,675
the more control we'll give
it to it and the more we'll be

2528
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:35,010
willing to let it run our society.

2529
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:38,583
And hence there's this kind of loop where

2530
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:40,202
the society could be manipulated

2531
01:39:40,202 --> 01:39:42,713
to let the AI system run it.

2532
01:39:42,713 --> 01:39:43,966
- Right. Well, I mean, look, one,

2533
01:39:43,966 --> 01:39:47,507
one of the things that's sort
of interesting is we might

2534
01:39:47,506 --> 01:39:50,149
say, we always think
we're making progress,

2535
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:54,529
but yet if you know in
a sense, by by saying,

2536
01:39:54,529 --> 01:39:58,632
let's take what already exists
and use that as a model for

2537
01:39:58,632 --> 01:40:00,568
what should exist.

2538
01:40:00,568 --> 01:40:01,400
- [Fridman] Yeah.

2539
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,805
- Then, you know, it's
interesting that for example,

2540
01:40:03,805 --> 01:40:06,478
you know, many religions have
taken that point of view.

2541
01:40:06,478 --> 01:40:07,310
There is a, you know,

2542
01:40:07,310 --> 01:40:10,634
a sacred book that got written
at Time X and it defines how

2543
01:40:10,634 --> 01:40:13,760
people should act for all future time.

2544
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,586
And that's, you know,
it's a, it's a model that,

2545
01:40:16,586 --> 01:40:18,680
that people have operated with.

2546
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,868
And in a sense, you know,

2547
01:40:19,868 --> 01:40:23,606
this is a version of that,
that kind of statement.

2548
01:40:23,606 --> 01:40:24,461
It's like,

2549
01:40:24,462 --> 01:40:29,462
take the 2023 version of sort
of how the world has exposed

2550
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:33,440
itself and use that to
define what the world

2551
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:34,965
should do in the future.

2552
01:40:34,966 --> 01:40:37,192
- But it's not, it's an
imprecise definition, right?

2553
01:40:37,192 --> 01:40:41,371
Because just like with
religious text and which GPT the

2554
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:45,538
human interpretation of
what GPT says will be the,

2555
01:40:46,524 --> 01:40:49,774
will be the perturbation in the system.

2556
01:40:51,064 --> 01:40:52,021
It'll be the noise,

2557
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:53,376
it'd be full of uncertainty.

2558
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:57,644
It's not like GPT will tell
you exactly what to do.

2559
01:40:57,644 --> 01:41:01,000
It'll tell you approx a
narrative of what, like a, a,

2560
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,168
you know,

2561
01:41:02,168 --> 01:41:05,326
it's like a turn the other
cheek kind of narrative, right?

2562
01:41:05,326 --> 01:41:07,635
That's, that's not a fully
instructive narrative.

2563
01:41:07,635 --> 01:41:08,467
- [Wolfram] Well, until,

2564
01:41:08,467 --> 01:41:11,782
until the AI control all
the systems in the world.

2565
01:41:11,782 --> 01:41:14,502
- They will be able to very
precisely tell you what to do.

2566
01:41:14,502 --> 01:41:16,603
- [Wolfram] Well. They'll do
what they, you know, they'll,

2567
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:19,185
they'll just do this or that
thing and that and that.

2568
01:41:19,185 --> 01:41:20,353
And, and not only that,

2569
01:41:20,354 --> 01:41:22,573
they'll be auto suggesting
to each person, you know,

2570
01:41:22,573 --> 01:41:24,333
do this next, do that next.

2571
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:25,951
So I think it's a,

2572
01:41:25,951 --> 01:41:28,533
it's a slightly more
prescriptive situation

2573
01:41:28,533 --> 01:41:30,685
than one has typically seen.

2574
01:41:30,685 --> 01:41:32,457
But I, you know, I think this,

2575
01:41:32,457 --> 01:41:35,328
this whole question of sort of what,

2576
01:41:35,328 --> 01:41:37,405
what's left for the humans, so to speak,

2577
01:41:37,405 --> 01:41:39,988
to what extent do we, you know,

2578
01:41:41,068 --> 01:41:45,775
this idea that there is an
existing kind of corpus of

2579
01:41:45,775 --> 01:41:48,557
purpose for humans defined by
what's on the internet and so

2580
01:41:48,557 --> 01:41:51,255
on, that's an important thing.

2581
01:41:51,255 --> 01:41:53,485
But then the question of sort of,

2582
01:41:53,485 --> 01:41:56,336
as we explore what we can think of as

2583
01:41:56,336 --> 01:41:57,679
the computational universe,

2584
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,893
as we explore all these different
possibilities for what we

2585
01:41:59,893 --> 01:42:01,583
could do, all these different inventions,

2586
01:42:01,583 --> 01:42:03,751
we could make all these different things.

2587
01:42:03,751 --> 01:42:06,400
The question is which ones
do we choose to follow?

2588
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:09,305
Those choices are the
things that in a sense,

2589
01:42:09,305 --> 01:42:13,972
if the humans want to still
have kind of human progress,

2590
01:42:15,761 --> 01:42:19,183
that's what we, we get to make
those choices, so to speak.

2591
01:42:19,184 --> 01:42:23,483
In other words, the, the,
there's this idea, if you say,

2592
01:42:23,483 --> 01:42:26,815
let's take the kind of what exists today

2593
01:42:29,462 --> 01:42:31,626
and use that as the determiner of all

2594
01:42:31,626 --> 01:42:33,529
of what there is in the future,

2595
01:42:33,529 --> 01:42:36,026
the thing that is sort of
the opportunity for humans is

2596
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:39,161
there will be many
possibilities thrown up.

2597
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:41,166
There are many different
things that could happen.

2598
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:42,009
It'll be done.

2599
01:42:42,009 --> 01:42:46,259
And the insofar as we
want to be in the loop,

2600
01:42:46,259 --> 01:42:49,282
the thing that makes sense for
us to be in the loop doing is

2601
01:42:49,282 --> 01:42:52,801
picking which of those
possibilities we want.

2602
01:42:52,801 --> 01:42:55,486
- But the degree to which
there's a feedback loop

2603
01:42:55,485 --> 01:42:58,805
of the idea that we're picking something

2604
01:42:58,805 --> 01:43:00,708
starts becoming questionable because

2605
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:02,634
we're influenced by the various systems.

2606
01:43:02,634 --> 01:43:03,645
- [Wolfram] Absolutely.

2607
01:43:03,645 --> 01:43:04,478
- The, like,

2608
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:05,757
if that becomes more and more
source of our education and

2609
01:43:05,756 --> 01:43:07,911
wisdom and knowledge.

2610
01:43:07,912 --> 01:43:11,092
- Right. The AI take
over, I mean my, you know,

2611
01:43:11,091 --> 01:43:14,347
I've thought for a long time
that, you know, it's the,

2612
01:43:14,347 --> 01:43:17,015
you know, AR auto suggestion

2613
01:43:17,015 --> 01:43:19,820
that's really the thing that
makes the AIs take over.

2614
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:21,449
It's just then the humans just follow,

2615
01:43:21,449 --> 01:43:23,118
you know? Yeah.

2616
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:25,155
- We'll no longer write
emails to each other.

2617
01:43:25,155 --> 01:43:28,036
We'll just send the auto suggested email.

2618
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:29,336
- Yeah, yeah.

2619
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:31,610
But the thing where humans are potentially

2620
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:33,114
in the loop is when

2621
01:43:33,114 --> 01:43:34,648
there's a choice and
when there's a choice,

2622
01:43:34,648 --> 01:43:38,520
which we could make based
on our kind of whole web

2623
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,804
of history and so on.

2624
01:43:39,805 --> 01:43:40,637
- [Fridman] Yeah.

2625
01:43:40,637 --> 01:43:43,503
- And, and that's, you
know, that's insofar

2626
01:43:43,503 --> 01:43:47,819
as it's all just, you
know, determined, you know,

2627
01:43:47,819 --> 01:43:49,808
the humans don't have a place.

2628
01:43:49,809 --> 01:43:52,536
And, and by the way, I mean,
you know, at, at some level,

2629
01:43:52,536 --> 01:43:54,846
you know, it's all kind of a,

2630
01:43:54,846 --> 01:43:57,332
a complicated philosophical
issue because at some level

2631
01:43:57,332 --> 01:44:00,070
the universe is just doing what it does.

2632
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:04,734
We are parts of that universe
that are necessarily doing

2633
01:44:04,734 --> 01:44:06,634
what we do, so to speak,

2634
01:44:06,635 --> 01:44:10,244
yet we feel we have sort of
agency in what we're doing.

2635
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:11,222
And that's,

2636
01:44:11,222 --> 01:44:13,932
that's its own separate
kind of interesting issue.

2637
01:44:13,932 --> 01:44:15,359
- And we also kind of feel like

2638
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:16,891
we're the final destination
of what the universe

2639
01:44:16,891 --> 01:44:18,559
was meant to create.

2640
01:44:20,469 --> 01:44:22,787
But we very well could be,

2641
01:44:22,787 --> 01:44:25,778
and likely are some kind of
intermediate step, obviously.

2642
01:44:25,778 --> 01:44:26,726
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

2643
01:44:26,725 --> 01:44:30,563
- What we're, we're most
certainly some intermediate step.

2644
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:33,150
The question is if there's
some cooler, more complex,

2645
01:44:33,149 --> 01:44:37,230
more interesting things that's
going to be materialized.

2646
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:38,389
- [Wolfram] The computational universe

2647
01:44:38,389 --> 01:44:39,804
is full of such things.

2648
01:44:39,804 --> 01:44:42,643
- But in, in our particular
pocket specifically,

2649
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:45,484
if this is the best we've gotta
do or not, that's kind of a.

2650
01:44:45,484 --> 01:44:47,684
- We can make all kinds of
interesting things in the

2651
01:44:47,684 --> 01:44:49,235
computational universe.

2652
01:44:49,235 --> 01:44:51,764
We, when we look at them, we say,

2653
01:44:51,764 --> 01:44:54,402
yeah, you know, that's,
that's a thing we don't,

2654
01:44:54,402 --> 01:44:56,471
it doesn't really
connect with our current,

2655
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:58,596
our current way of thinking about things.

2656
01:44:58,596 --> 01:45:00,733
I mean, it's like in
mathematics, you know,

2657
01:45:00,733 --> 01:45:01,952
we've got certain theorems.

2658
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,581
They're about three or 4
million that that human

2659
01:45:03,581 --> 01:45:06,967
mathematicians have written
down and published and so on.

2660
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,572
But they're an infinite number of possible

2661
01:45:08,572 --> 01:45:09,902
mathematical theorems.

2662
01:45:09,902 --> 01:45:12,069
We just go out into the universe
of possible theorems and

2663
01:45:12,069 --> 01:45:13,289
pick another theorem.

2664
01:45:13,289 --> 01:45:14,761
And then people will say, well,

2665
01:45:14,761 --> 01:45:17,676
you know, that's, you know,
they look at it and they say,

2666
01:45:17,676 --> 01:45:19,467
I don't know what this theorem means.

2667
01:45:19,467 --> 01:45:23,056
It's not connected to the
things that are part of kind of

2668
01:45:23,056 --> 01:45:24,889
the web of history that
we're dealing with.

2669
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:26,057
You know, I think one,

2670
01:45:26,057 --> 01:45:28,394
one point to make about sort
of understanding AI and its

2671
01:45:28,394 --> 01:45:31,984
relationship to us is as
we have this kind of whole

2672
01:45:31,984 --> 01:45:35,340
infrastructure of AI is doing
their thing and doing their

2673
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,547
thing in a way that is perhaps not

2674
01:45:37,547 --> 01:45:39,534
readily understandable by us humans.

2675
01:45:39,534 --> 01:45:41,185
You know, you might say that's a,

2676
01:45:41,185 --> 01:45:42,756
that's a very weird situation.

2677
01:45:42,756 --> 01:45:45,881
How can we have built this
thing that behaves in a way that

2678
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:48,630
we can't understand that's
full of computational

2679
01:45:48,631 --> 01:45:50,585
disability, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

2680
01:45:50,585 --> 01:45:51,719
You know, what, what is this,

2681
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:55,118
what's it gonna feel like when
the world is run by AIs whose

2682
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:57,139
operations we can't understand?

2683
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:59,384
And the thing one realizes is actually,

2684
01:45:59,384 --> 01:46:01,155
we've seen this before.

2685
01:46:01,155 --> 01:46:03,685
That's what happens when we
exist in the natural world.

2686
01:46:03,685 --> 01:46:06,555
The natural world is full of
things that operate according

2687
01:46:06,555 --> 01:46:08,158
to definite rules.

2688
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:09,425
They have all kinds of, you know,

2689
01:46:09,425 --> 01:46:10,546
computational irreducibility,

2690
01:46:10,546 --> 01:46:12,614
we don't understand what the natural world

2691
01:46:12,613 --> 01:46:13,824
is doing occasionally.

2692
01:46:13,824 --> 01:46:15,860
And, and you know, when you say, you know,

2693
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:18,190
are the AI gonna wipe us out, for example?

2694
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:19,072
Well, it's kind of like,

2695
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:22,414
is the machination of the AI
going to lead to this thing

2696
01:46:22,414 --> 01:46:25,204
that eventually comes
and destroys the species?

2697
01:46:25,204 --> 01:46:26,735
Well, we can also ask the same thing

2698
01:46:26,735 --> 01:46:27,746
about the natural world or

2699
01:46:27,746 --> 01:46:30,279
the machination of the natural
world going to eventually

2700
01:46:30,279 --> 01:46:32,663
lead to this thing that's
going to, you know, make,

2701
01:46:32,662 --> 01:46:35,196
make the earth explode
or something like this.

2702
01:46:35,197 --> 01:46:37,747
Those are, those are questions, those are,

2703
01:46:37,747 --> 01:46:40,715
and insofar as we think we
understand what's happening in

2704
01:46:40,715 --> 01:46:41,780
the natural world,

2705
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:45,192
that's a result of science
and natural science and so on.

2706
01:46:45,192 --> 01:46:47,502
One of the things we can
expect when there's this giant

2707
01:46:47,502 --> 01:46:49,947
infrastructure of the AIs is
that's where we have to kind of

2708
01:46:49,948 --> 01:46:54,447
invent a new kind of natural
science that kind of is the

2709
01:46:54,447 --> 01:46:57,734
natural science that explains
to us how the AIs work.

2710
01:46:57,734 --> 01:46:59,889
I mean, it's kind of like we can, we can,

2711
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:01,193
you know, we have a,

2712
01:47:01,193 --> 01:47:02,728
I don't know, a horse or something,

2713
01:47:02,728 --> 01:47:04,704
and we're trying to get it
to, we're trying to, you know,

2714
01:47:04,704 --> 01:47:06,688
ride the horse and go from here to there.

2715
01:47:06,688 --> 01:47:08,819
We don't really understand
how the horse works inside,

2716
01:47:08,819 --> 01:47:11,811
but we can get certain
rules and certain, you know,

2717
01:47:11,811 --> 01:47:13,648
approaches that we take to,

2718
01:47:13,648 --> 01:47:16,489
to persuade the horse to go
from here to there and, and,

2719
01:47:16,488 --> 01:47:18,027
and take us there.

2720
01:47:18,028 --> 01:47:19,784
And that's the same type of
thing that we're kind of dealing

2721
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:22,634
with, with the sort of
incomprehensible computationally,

2722
01:47:22,635 --> 01:47:23,967
irreducible AIs.

2723
01:47:25,476 --> 01:47:27,622
But we can identify these kinds of,

2724
01:47:27,622 --> 01:47:30,834
we can find these kind of
pockets of reducibility that we

2725
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:34,266
can kind of, you know, that, I don't know,

2726
01:47:34,266 --> 01:47:37,311
we grabbing onto the mane of
the horse or something to be

2727
01:47:37,311 --> 01:47:38,979
able to, to ride it.

2728
01:47:39,895 --> 01:47:43,407
Or we figure out, you know, if
we, if we do this or that to,

2729
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:46,444
to ride the horse, that that's
a, a, a successful way to,

2730
01:47:46,444 --> 01:47:49,135
to get it to do what, what
we're interested in doing.

2731
01:47:49,135 --> 01:47:51,466
- There does seem to be a
difference between a horse and a

2732
01:47:51,466 --> 01:47:53,133
large language model

2733
01:47:58,537 --> 01:48:00,366
or something that could be called Agi

2734
01:48:00,367 --> 01:48:01,663
connected to the internet.

2735
01:48:01,662 --> 01:48:04,290
So lemme just ask you about big
philosophical question about

2736
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:05,985
the threats of these things.

2737
01:48:05,985 --> 01:48:07,591
There's a lot of people
like Eliezer Yudkowsky,

2738
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:11,924
who worry about the existential
risks of AI systems.

2739
01:48:12,863 --> 01:48:17,301
Is that something that
you worry about? You know,

2740
01:48:17,301 --> 01:48:20,350
sometimes when you're building
an incredible system, like,

2741
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:25,076
well, from Alpha, you can
kind of get lost in it.

2742
01:48:25,076 --> 01:48:27,068
- I try and think a little bit

2743
01:48:27,068 --> 01:48:28,872
about the implications
of what one's doing.

2744
01:48:28,872 --> 01:48:29,704
- You know,

2745
01:48:29,704 --> 01:48:31,371
it's like the Manhattan
project kind of situation

2746
01:48:31,371 --> 01:48:32,203
where you're like,

2747
01:48:32,203 --> 01:48:33,944
it's some of the most incredible physics

2748
01:48:33,944 --> 01:48:34,911
in engineering being done.

2749
01:48:34,911 --> 01:48:37,547
But it's like, huh, where's this gonna go?

2750
01:48:37,546 --> 01:48:40,308
- I think some of these arguments
about kind of, you know,

2751
01:48:40,309 --> 01:48:41,945
they'll always be a smarter AI.

2752
01:48:41,944 --> 01:48:42,777
There'll always be,

2753
01:48:42,778 --> 01:48:45,057
you know, and eventually the
AIs will get smarter than us,

2754
01:48:45,056 --> 01:48:48,103
and then all sorts of terrible
things will happen to me.

2755
01:48:48,103 --> 01:48:51,505
Some of those arguments remind
me of kind of the ontological

2756
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:54,154
arguments for the existence
of God and things like this.

2757
01:48:54,154 --> 01:48:57,441
They're kind of arguments that
are based on some particular

2758
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:00,456
model, fairly simple
model, often of kind of,

2759
01:49:00,456 --> 01:49:02,952
there is always a greater
this, that and the other.

2760
01:49:02,952 --> 01:49:05,229
You know, this is, and that's, you know,

2761
01:49:05,229 --> 01:49:06,405
those arguments tend,

2762
01:49:06,405 --> 01:49:09,376
what tends to happen in the
sort of reality of how these

2763
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:11,208
things develop is that
it's more complicated

2764
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:12,260
than you expect.

2765
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:14,922
That the kind of simple,
logical argument that says,

2766
01:49:14,921 --> 01:49:16,693
oh, eventually there'll
be a super intelligence,

2767
01:49:16,694 --> 01:49:18,510
and then it will, you know, do this.

2768
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,677
And that turns out not
to really be the story.

2769
01:49:21,677 --> 01:49:23,516
It turns out to be a
more complicated story.

2770
01:49:23,516 --> 01:49:24,349
So for example,

2771
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:25,850
here's an example of an issue.

2772
01:49:25,850 --> 01:49:27,654
Is there an apex intelligence,

2773
01:49:27,654 --> 01:49:30,691
just like there might be an
apex predator in some, you know,

2774
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,273
ecosystem.

2775
01:49:32,274 --> 01:49:33,903
Is there gonna be an apex intelligence,

2776
01:49:33,903 --> 01:49:36,907
the most intelligent thing
that there could possibly be?

2777
01:49:36,907 --> 01:49:38,775
Right? I think the answer is no.

2778
01:49:38,774 --> 01:49:40,865
And in fact, we already know
this, and it's a kind of a,

2779
01:49:40,865 --> 01:49:43,528
back to the whole computational
irreducibility story.

2780
01:49:43,529 --> 01:49:46,785
There's kind of a, a
question of, you know,

2781
01:49:46,784 --> 01:49:50,568
even if you have, if you,
if you have sort of a,

2782
01:49:50,569 --> 01:49:54,461
a touring machine and you
have a touring machine that,

2783
01:49:54,461 --> 01:49:58,342
that runs as long as possible
before, before it halts,

2784
01:49:58,342 --> 01:49:59,818
you say, is this the machine?

2785
01:49:59,818 --> 01:50:01,820
Is this the apex machine that does that?

2786
01:50:01,819 --> 01:50:04,438
There will always be a
machine that can go longer.

2787
01:50:04,438 --> 01:50:07,056
And as you go out to the
infinite collection of possible

2788
01:50:07,055 --> 01:50:09,596
touring machines, you'll
never have reached the end,

2789
01:50:09,596 --> 01:50:10,429
so to speak.

2790
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:12,039
You'll never, you'll always be able to,

2791
01:50:12,039 --> 01:50:14,539
it's kind of like the same same
question of whether there'll

2792
01:50:14,539 --> 01:50:16,354
always be another invention. Yeah.

2793
01:50:16,354 --> 01:50:18,257
Will you always be able
to invent another thing?

2794
01:50:18,256 --> 01:50:19,089
The answer is yes,

2795
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:21,734
there's an infinite tower
of possible inventions.

2796
01:50:21,734 --> 01:50:23,474
- That's one definition of apex.

2797
01:50:23,474 --> 01:50:28,474
But the, the other is like,
which I also thought you were,

2798
01:50:28,597 --> 01:50:31,095
which I also think might be true, is,

2799
01:50:31,095 --> 01:50:33,463
is there a species that's
the apex intelligence

2800
01:50:33,463 --> 01:50:35,475
right now on earth?

2801
01:50:35,475 --> 01:50:38,492
So it's not trivial to
say that humans are that.

2802
01:50:38,493 --> 01:50:39,636
- Yeah, it's not trivial.

2803
01:50:39,636 --> 01:50:41,472
I agree. It, it's, you know,

2804
01:50:41,471 --> 01:50:44,449
I think one of the things that I,

2805
01:50:44,449 --> 01:50:47,336
I've long been curious about
kind of other intelligences,

2806
01:50:47,337 --> 01:50:48,863
so to speak.

2807
01:50:48,863 --> 01:50:49,712
I mean, I, you know, I,

2808
01:50:49,712 --> 01:50:54,629
I view intelligence is like
computation and it's kind of a,

2809
01:50:55,948 --> 01:50:58,783
you know, you're sort of,
you have the set of rules,

2810
01:50:58,783 --> 01:51:00,721
you deduce what happens.

2811
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,867
I have tended to think now
that there's this sort of

2812
01:51:04,868 --> 01:51:07,652
specialization of
computation that is sort of a

2813
01:51:07,652 --> 01:51:10,707
consciousness like thing
that has to do with these,

2814
01:51:10,707 --> 01:51:12,402
you know, computational boundedness,

2815
01:51:12,403 --> 01:51:14,458
single thread of experience,

2816
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:17,351
these kinds of things that
are the specialization of

2817
01:51:17,351 --> 01:51:20,818
computation that corresponds
to a somewhat human-like,

2818
01:51:20,819 --> 01:51:23,590
experience of the world.

2819
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:25,780
Now the question is,
so, so that's, you know,

2820
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:29,186
there may be other intelligences
like, you know, you know,

2821
01:51:29,186 --> 01:51:31,673
the aphorism, you know, the
weather has a mind of its own,

2822
01:51:31,673 --> 01:51:34,599
it's a different kind of
intelligence that can compute all

2823
01:51:34,599 --> 01:51:37,427
kinds of things that are
hard for us to compute,

2824
01:51:37,427 --> 01:51:40,354
but it is not well aligned
with us with the way that we

2825
01:51:40,354 --> 01:51:41,937
think about things.

2826
01:51:42,871 --> 01:51:44,126
It doesn't, it doesn't,

2827
01:51:44,126 --> 01:51:46,192
it doesn't think the way
we think about things.

2828
01:51:46,192 --> 01:51:48,143
And you know, in this idea of different,

2829
01:51:48,143 --> 01:51:50,252
different intelligences,
every different mind,

2830
01:51:50,252 --> 01:51:53,442
every different human mind is
a different intelligence that

2831
01:51:53,442 --> 01:51:55,853
thinks about things in different ways.

2832
01:51:55,853 --> 01:51:56,875
And you know, in,

2833
01:51:56,875 --> 01:51:59,505
in terms of the kind of
formalism of our physics project,

2834
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:02,011
we talk about this idea of rural space,

2835
01:52:02,011 --> 01:52:04,476
the space of all possible
sort of rural systems and

2836
01:52:04,476 --> 01:52:07,984
different minds are in a sense
of different points in rural

2837
01:52:07,984 --> 01:52:10,306
space, human minds.

2838
01:52:10,306 --> 01:52:12,902
Ones that have grown up with
the same kind of culture and

2839
01:52:12,902 --> 01:52:15,234
ideas and things like
this might be pretty close

2840
01:52:15,234 --> 01:52:16,448
in rural space.

2841
01:52:16,448 --> 01:52:17,766
Pretty easy for them to communicate.

2842
01:52:17,766 --> 01:52:19,315
Pretty easy to translate,

2843
01:52:19,315 --> 01:52:22,130
pretty easy to move from one
place in rural space that

2844
01:52:22,131 --> 01:52:23,431
corresponds to one mind,

2845
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,323
to another place in rural space
that corresponds to another

2846
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:29,943
sort of nearby mind when we
deal with kind of more distant

2847
01:52:29,944 --> 01:52:32,572
things in rural space,
like, you know, the,

2848
01:52:32,572 --> 01:52:35,784
the pet cats or something, you know,

2849
01:52:35,783 --> 01:52:39,349
the pet cat has some aspects
that are shared with us.

2850
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:41,218
The emotional responses
of the cat are somewhat

2851
01:52:41,217 --> 01:52:42,461
similar to ours,

2852
01:52:42,462 --> 01:52:47,181
but the cat is further away in
rural space than people are.

2853
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,995
And so then the question is, you know,

2854
01:52:48,996 --> 01:52:51,766
can we identify sort of the,

2855
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:55,107
can we make a translation from
our thought processes to the

2856
01:52:55,108 --> 01:52:57,918
thought processes of, of a
cat or something like this?

2857
01:52:57,917 --> 01:53:01,424
And you know, what, what will
we get when we, you know,

2858
01:53:01,425 --> 01:53:02,864
what, what will happen when we get there?

2859
01:53:02,864 --> 01:53:05,369
And I think it's the case
that that many, you know,

2860
01:53:05,369 --> 01:53:07,711
many animals, I don't know,
dogs for example, you know,

2861
01:53:07,711 --> 01:53:10,306
they have elaborate olfactory systems.

2862
01:53:10,306 --> 01:53:11,367
They, you know, they,

2863
01:53:11,368 --> 01:53:13,909
they have sort of the smell
architecture of the, of the,

2864
01:53:13,908 --> 01:53:17,548
of the world, so to speak,
in a way that we don't.

2865
01:53:17,548 --> 01:53:19,144
And so, you know, if,

2866
01:53:19,145 --> 01:53:22,039
if you were sort of talking
to the dog and you could,

2867
01:53:22,038 --> 01:53:25,699
you know, communicate in a
language, the dog will say, well,

2868
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:28,546
this is a, you know, a a, you know, a,

2869
01:53:28,546 --> 01:53:31,576
a flowing smelling this,
that, and the other thing,

2870
01:53:31,576 --> 01:53:34,663
concepts that we just
don't have any idea about.

2871
01:53:34,663 --> 01:53:39,559
Now what's what's interesting
about that is one day we will

2872
01:53:39,559 --> 01:53:42,863
have chemical sensors that
do a really pretty good job.

2873
01:53:42,863 --> 01:53:44,942
You know, we'll have artificial
noses that work pretty well,

2874
01:53:44,942 --> 01:53:48,483
and we might have our augmented
reality systems show us kind

2875
01:53:48,483 --> 01:53:52,069
of the same map that the dog
could see and things like this.

2876
01:53:52,069 --> 01:53:52,923
So the, you know,

2877
01:53:52,923 --> 01:53:54,581
it's similar to what
happens in the dog's brain.

2878
01:53:54,581 --> 01:53:57,975
And eventually we will have
kind of expanded in rural space

2879
01:53:57,975 --> 01:54:01,065
to the point where we will
have those same sensory

2880
01:54:01,064 --> 01:54:03,210
experiences that dogs have,

2881
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:06,097
and we will have internalized
what it means to have,

2882
01:54:06,096 --> 01:54:08,184
you know, the smell landscape or whatever.

2883
01:54:08,185 --> 01:54:11,563
And, and so then we will have
kind of colonized that part of

2884
01:54:11,563 --> 01:54:16,170
rural space until, you know,
we haven't gone, you know,

2885
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:19,273
some things that, that, you
know, animals and so on.

2886
01:54:19,273 --> 01:54:22,418
Do we sort of successfully
understand, others We do not.

2887
01:54:22,417 --> 01:54:27,417
And the question of, of what
kind of, what is the, you know,

2888
01:54:28,091 --> 01:54:30,501
what, what representation, you know, how,

2889
01:54:30,502 --> 01:54:33,660
how do we convert things that
animals think about to things

2890
01:54:33,659 --> 01:54:37,222
that we can think about?
That's not a trivial thing.

2891
01:54:37,222 --> 01:54:39,850
And you know, I've,
I've long been curious.

2892
01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:42,692
I've had a very bizarre
project at one point of,

2893
01:54:42,692 --> 01:54:45,055
of trying to make an iPad game that a cat

2894
01:54:45,055 --> 01:54:46,961
could win against its owner.

2895
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:47,817
- Right.

2896
01:54:47,817 --> 01:54:48,738
So it feels like there's a deep

2897
01:54:48,738 --> 01:54:51,631
philosophical goal there, though.

2898
01:54:51,631 --> 01:54:52,710
- Yes, yes.

2899
01:54:52,711 --> 01:54:56,220
I mean, the, the, you know,
I was curious if, you know,

2900
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:57,902
if pets can work in Minecraft or something

2901
01:54:57,902 --> 01:54:59,697
and can construct things,

2902
01:54:59,697 --> 01:55:02,435
what will they construct and
will what they construct be

2903
01:55:02,435 --> 01:55:03,965
something where we look
at and we say, yeah,

2904
01:55:03,965 --> 01:55:05,252
I recognize that.

2905
01:55:05,252 --> 01:55:08,333
Or will it be something that
looks to us like something

2906
01:55:08,332 --> 01:55:10,312
that's out there in the
computational universe that one of

2907
01:55:10,313 --> 01:55:11,333
my, you know,

2908
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:14,505
cellular automat might have
produced where we say, oh, yeah,

2909
01:55:14,505 --> 01:55:16,471
I can kind of see it operates
according to some rules.

2910
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:17,779
I don't know why you
would use those rules.

2911
01:55:17,779 --> 01:55:18,989
I don't know why you would care.

2912
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:22,112
- Yeah. I actually, just
to link on that, seriously,

2913
01:55:22,113 --> 01:55:24,865
is there a connector in
the royal space between you

2914
01:55:24,864 --> 01:55:28,648
and a cat where the cat
could legitimately win?

2915
01:55:28,649 --> 01:55:32,167
So iPad is a very limited interface.

2916
01:55:32,167 --> 01:55:33,000
- [Wolfram] Yeah, I, I-

2917
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,960
- I wonder if there's
a game where cats win.

2918
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,489
- I think the problem is that
cats don't tend to be that

2919
01:55:37,488 --> 01:55:40,052
interested in what's
happening on the iPad.

2920
01:55:40,052 --> 01:55:41,902
- [Fridman] Yeah. That's
an interface issue.

2921
01:55:41,902 --> 01:55:43,332
- Yeah. Right, right, right.

2922
01:55:43,332 --> 01:55:47,543
No, I think it is likely
that, I mean, you know,

2923
01:55:47,542 --> 01:55:50,323
there are plenty of animals
that would successfully eat us

2924
01:55:50,323 --> 01:55:53,688
if we were, you know, if
we were exposed to them.

2925
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:54,713
And so there's, you know, it,

2926
01:55:54,713 --> 01:55:56,958
it's gonna pounce faster

2927
01:55:56,958 --> 01:55:59,145
than we can get out of the way and so on.

2928
01:55:59,145 --> 01:56:00,675
So there, there are plenty of, and,

2929
01:56:00,675 --> 01:56:02,533
and probably it's going to, you know,

2930
01:56:02,533 --> 01:56:04,062
we think we've hidden ourselves,

2931
01:56:04,061 --> 01:56:06,073
but we haven't successfully
hidden ourselves.

2932
01:56:06,073 --> 01:56:07,009
- That's a physical strength.

2933
01:56:07,009 --> 01:56:10,033
I wonder if there's something
in more in the realm of

2934
01:56:10,033 --> 01:56:14,378
intelligence where an animal
like a cat could out-.

2935
01:56:14,377 --> 01:56:17,063
- Well, I think there are things
certainly in terms of the,

2936
01:56:17,063 --> 01:56:20,416
the speed of processing certain
kinds of things, for sure.

2937
01:56:20,416 --> 01:56:22,847
I mean, the, the question
of what, you know,

2938
01:56:22,847 --> 01:56:26,212
is there a game of chess, for
example, is there cat chess?

2939
01:56:26,212 --> 01:56:29,225
That the cats could
play against each other.

2940
01:56:29,225 --> 01:56:31,358
And if we tried to play
a cat, we'd always lose,

2941
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:32,898
I don't know.

2942
01:56:32,898 --> 01:56:34,242
- It might have to do with speed it,

2943
01:56:34,242 --> 01:56:37,003
but it might have to
do with concepts also.

2944
01:56:37,002 --> 01:56:39,171
It might be concepts in the cat's head.

2945
01:56:39,171 --> 01:56:44,171
- I, I tend to think that our
species from its invention of

2946
01:56:44,229 --> 01:56:47,153
language has managed to build
up this kind of tower of

2947
01:56:47,153 --> 01:56:50,742
abstraction that for
things like a chess like

2948
01:56:50,742 --> 01:56:53,139
game will make us win.

2949
01:56:53,139 --> 01:56:53,971
In other words,

2950
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:57,001
we've become through the fact
that we've kind of experienced

2951
01:56:57,002 --> 01:57:00,089
language and learnt abstraction, you know,

2952
01:57:00,088 --> 01:57:02,400
we've sort of become smarter
at those kinds of abstract

2953
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,412
kinds of things.

2954
01:57:04,412 --> 01:57:05,244
Now, you know,

2955
01:57:05,244 --> 01:57:06,514
that doesn't make us smarter

2956
01:57:06,514 --> 01:57:08,493
at catching a mouse or something.

2957
01:57:08,493 --> 01:57:11,224
It makes us smarter at the
things that we've chosen to,

2958
01:57:11,225 --> 01:57:14,695
to sort of con, you know, to
concern ourselves, which are,

2959
01:57:14,695 --> 01:57:16,863
are these kinds of abstract things.

2960
01:57:16,863 --> 01:57:18,702
And, and I think, you know, this is again,

2961
01:57:18,702 --> 01:57:20,243
back to the question of of, you know,

2962
01:57:20,243 --> 01:57:21,621
what does one care about?

2963
01:57:21,621 --> 01:57:22,801
You know, if one's a,

2964
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:25,152
if one's the, you know, the cat, if you,

2965
01:57:25,152 --> 01:57:26,997
if you have the discussion
with a cat, if we can,

2966
01:57:26,997 --> 01:57:29,225
if we can translate things
to have the discussion with a

2967
01:57:29,225 --> 01:57:31,721
cat, the cat will say, you know,

2968
01:57:31,721 --> 01:57:35,304
I'm very excited that
this light is moving.

2969
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:40,387
And we'll say, why do you care?

2970
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:41,927
And the cat will say,

2971
01:57:41,927 --> 01:57:43,702
that's the most important
thing in the world.

2972
01:57:43,702 --> 01:57:45,394
That this thing moves around.

2973
01:57:45,394 --> 01:57:48,373
I mean, it's like when you
ask about, I don't know, you,

2974
01:57:48,372 --> 01:57:50,869
you look at archeological
remains and you say,

2975
01:57:50,869 --> 01:57:54,323
these people had this, you
know, belief system about this.

2976
01:57:54,323 --> 01:57:55,156
And, you know,

2977
01:57:55,157 --> 01:57:57,140
that was the most important
thing in the world to them.

2978
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:59,485
And, and now we look at it and say,

2979
01:57:59,485 --> 01:58:01,278
we don't know what the point of it it was.

2980
01:58:01,278 --> 01:58:02,814
I mean, I, I've been curious, you know,

2981
01:58:02,814 --> 01:58:04,113
there are these hand prints on caves

2982
01:58:04,113 --> 01:58:06,137
from 20,000 or more years ago,

2983
01:58:06,136 --> 01:58:07,972
and it's like nobody knows
what these hand prints

2984
01:58:07,972 --> 01:58:09,511
were there for.

2985
01:58:09,511 --> 01:58:12,331
You know, that they may
have been a representation

2986
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:14,440
of the most important
thing you can imagine.

2987
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,224
They may just have been
some, you know, some kid who,

2988
01:58:17,225 --> 01:58:19,744
who rubbed their hands in the
mud and stuck 'em on the walls

2989
01:58:19,743 --> 01:58:20,893
of the cave.

2990
01:58:20,894 --> 01:58:22,784
You know, we don't, we don't know.

2991
01:58:22,784 --> 01:58:26,987
And I think, but this, this
whole question of what you know,

2992
01:58:26,987 --> 01:58:31,987
is when you say this question
of sort of what's the smartest

2993
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,570
thing around,

2994
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:36,628
there's the question of what
kind of computation are you

2995
01:58:36,628 --> 01:58:37,622
trying to do?

2996
01:58:37,622 --> 01:58:39,106
If you're saying, you know,

2997
01:58:39,106 --> 01:58:43,692
if you say you've got some
well-defined computation

2998
01:58:43,692 --> 01:58:45,036
and how do you implement it?

2999
01:58:45,036 --> 01:58:47,313
Well, you could implement
it by nerve cells,

3000
01:58:47,313 --> 01:58:48,292
you know, firing.

3001
01:58:48,292 --> 01:58:50,844
You can implement it with
silicone and electronics.

3002
01:58:50,844 --> 01:58:53,748
You can implement it by some
kind of molecular computation

3003
01:58:53,748 --> 01:58:57,465
process in the human immune
system or in some molecular

3004
01:58:57,466 --> 01:58:58,995
biology kind of thing.

3005
01:58:58,994 --> 01:59:00,657
They're different ways to implement it.

3006
01:59:00,658 --> 01:59:03,826
And you know, I think this question of,

3007
01:59:03,826 --> 01:59:06,278
of of sort of which, you know,

3008
01:59:06,278 --> 01:59:07,110
those different implementation methods

3009
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:08,943
will be of different speeds.

3010
01:59:08,944 --> 01:59:11,856
They'll be able to do
different things if you say,

3011
01:59:11,855 --> 01:59:15,597
you know, which, so an
interesting question would be,

3012
01:59:15,597 --> 01:59:20,328
what kinds of abstractions
are most natural in these

3013
01:59:20,328 --> 01:59:22,152
different kinds of systems?

3014
01:59:22,152 --> 01:59:25,057
So for a cat, it's for example, you know,

3015
01:59:25,057 --> 01:59:29,282
the visual scene that we
see, you might, you know,

3016
01:59:29,282 --> 01:59:32,494
we pick out certain objects,
we recognize, you know,

3017
01:59:32,493 --> 01:59:35,350
certain things in that visual scene.

3018
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:38,201
A cat might in principle,
recognize different things.

3019
01:59:38,202 --> 01:59:40,806
I, I suspect, you know, evolution,

3020
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:42,898
biological evolution is very slow.

3021
01:59:42,898 --> 01:59:45,552
And I suspect what a cat
notices is very similar.

3022
01:59:45,551 --> 01:59:47,840
And we even know that
from some neurophysiology,

3023
01:59:47,841 --> 01:59:51,052
what a cat notices is very
similar to what we notice.

3024
01:59:51,051 --> 01:59:52,335
Of course, there's a, you know,

3025
01:59:52,336 --> 01:59:55,094
one obvious difference is cats have only

3026
01:59:55,094 --> 01:59:56,881
two kinds of color receptors.

3027
01:59:56,881 --> 01:59:59,397
So they don't see in the same
kind of color that we do now,

3028
01:59:59,398 --> 02:00:01,894
you know, we say we are,
we're, we're better.

3029
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:04,225
We have three color receptors,
you know, red, green, blue.

3030
02:00:04,225 --> 02:00:05,997
We're not the overall winner.

3031
02:00:05,997 --> 02:00:07,219
I think the, the,

3032
02:00:07,219 --> 02:00:09,649
I think the mantis shrimp
is the overall winner

3033
02:00:09,649 --> 02:00:12,396
with 15 color receptors, I think.

3034
02:00:12,396 --> 02:00:13,229
So it can,

3035
02:00:13,229 --> 02:00:16,142
it can kind of make distinctions
that with our current,

3036
02:00:16,143 --> 02:00:21,104
you know, like the mantis
shrimp's view of reality is in,

3037
02:00:21,104 --> 02:00:25,405
at least in in terms of color
is much richer than ours now.

3038
02:00:25,404 --> 02:00:28,453
But what's interesting
is how do we get there?

3039
02:00:28,453 --> 02:00:31,608
So imagine we have this
augmented reality system that is

3040
02:00:31,608 --> 02:00:33,438
even, you know, it's
seeing into the infrared,

3041
02:00:33,438 --> 02:00:35,242
into the ultraviolet, things like this.

3042
02:00:35,242 --> 02:00:38,462
And it's translating that into
something that is connectable

3043
02:00:38,462 --> 02:00:39,529
to our brains,

3044
02:00:39,529 --> 02:00:42,192
either through our eyes or
more directly into our brains.

3045
02:00:42,192 --> 02:00:43,552
You know?

3046
02:00:43,552 --> 02:00:48,261
Then eventually our kind of
web of the types of things we

3047
02:00:48,261 --> 02:00:51,872
understand will extend to
those kinds of constructs

3048
02:00:51,872 --> 02:00:53,490
just as they have extended.

3049
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:56,448
I mean, there are plenty
of things where we see them

3050
02:00:56,448 --> 02:00:57,319
in the modern world,

3051
02:00:57,319 --> 02:00:58,856
because we made them with technology

3052
02:00:58,856 --> 02:01:01,297
and now we understand what that is.

3053
02:01:01,297 --> 02:01:03,235
But if we'd never seen that kind of thing,

3054
02:01:03,235 --> 02:01:04,885
we wouldn't have a way to describe it.

3055
02:01:04,886 --> 02:01:07,415
We wouldn't have a way to
understand it and so on.

3056
02:01:07,414 --> 02:01:08,247
- All right.

3057
02:01:08,247 --> 02:01:12,781
So that actually stemmed from
our conversation about whether

3058
02:01:12,782 --> 02:01:14,311
AI's gonna kill all of us.

3059
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:15,447
And you,

3060
02:01:15,448 --> 02:01:19,471
we've discussed this kind
of spreading of intelligence

3061
02:01:19,470 --> 02:01:23,751
through rural space that in
practice it just seems that

3062
02:01:23,752 --> 02:01:25,610
things get more complicated.

3063
02:01:25,609 --> 02:01:29,348
Things are more complicated
than the story of, well,

3064
02:01:29,349 --> 02:01:32,815
if you build a thing that's
plus one intelligence,

3065
02:01:32,815 --> 02:01:35,596
that thing will be able to
build the thing that's plus two

3066
02:01:35,596 --> 02:01:38,001
intelligence and plus three intelligence.

3067
02:01:38,002 --> 02:01:39,522
And that will be exponential.

3068
02:01:39,521 --> 02:01:41,689
It'll become more intelligent,

3069
02:01:41,689 --> 02:01:43,934
exponentially faster and so on until

3070
02:01:43,935 --> 02:01:45,541
it completely destroys everything.

3071
02:01:45,541 --> 02:01:50,541
But you know, that intuition
might still not be so simple,

3072
02:01:50,587 --> 02:01:53,634
but might still care carry validity.

3073
02:01:53,634 --> 02:01:56,615
And there's two interesting
trajectories here.

3074
02:01:56,615 --> 02:02:00,488
One, a super intelligence system remains

3075
02:02:00,488 --> 02:02:02,821
in rural proximity to humans

3076
02:02:03,979 --> 02:02:06,025
to where we're like, holy crap,

3077
02:02:06,024 --> 02:02:09,268
this thing is really intelligent,
let's select the present.

3078
02:02:09,269 --> 02:02:13,381
And then there could be perhaps
more terrifying intelligence

3079
02:02:13,381 --> 02:02:16,088
that starts moving away.

3080
02:02:16,088 --> 02:02:19,162
They might be around
us now that are moving

3081
02:02:19,162 --> 02:02:21,416
far away in rural space,

3082
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:24,210
but they're still sharing
physical resources with us, right?

3083
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:25,042
- [Wolfram] Yes. Yes.

3084
02:02:25,042 --> 02:02:27,015
And so they can rob us of
those physical resources and

3085
02:02:27,015 --> 02:02:30,342
destroy humans just kind of casually.

3086
02:02:30,342 --> 02:02:31,175
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

3087
02:02:31,176 --> 02:02:32,246
- Just, just-

3088
02:02:32,246 --> 02:02:33,277
- [Wolfram] Like nature could.

3089
02:02:33,277 --> 02:02:34,467
- Like nature could.

3090
02:02:34,467 --> 02:02:37,028
But it seems like there's
something unique about AI systems

3091
02:02:37,028 --> 02:02:39,278
where there is this kind of

3092
02:02:42,868 --> 02:02:44,409
exponential growth.

3093
02:02:44,409 --> 02:02:48,801
Like the way, well sorry,
nature has so many things in it.

3094
02:02:48,801 --> 02:02:50,371
One of the things that nature has,

3095
02:02:50,372 --> 02:02:52,805
which is very interesting,
are viruses for example.

3096
02:02:52,805 --> 02:02:55,453
There is systems within
nature that have this kind of

3097
02:02:55,453 --> 02:02:59,794
exponential effect and
that terrifies us humans.

3098
02:02:59,793 --> 02:03:00,860
Because again, you know,

3099
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:03,381
there's only 8 billion of
us and you can just kinda,

3100
02:03:03,381 --> 02:03:07,132
it's not that hard to just kind
of whack 'em all real quick.

3101
02:03:07,132 --> 02:03:11,002
So I mean, is that
something you think about?

3102
02:03:11,002 --> 02:03:13,270
- [Wolfram] Yeah, I've
thought about that. Yes.

3103
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:14,813
- The threat of it. I mean,

3104
02:03:14,813 --> 02:03:15,645
are you as concerned about it as

3105
02:03:15,645 --> 02:03:17,731
somebody like Eliezer Yudkowsky

3106
02:03:17,731 --> 02:03:18,954
for example, just big,

3107
02:03:18,954 --> 02:03:22,787
big painful negative
effects of AI on society?

3108
02:03:24,430 --> 02:03:25,467
- You know?

3109
02:03:25,467 --> 02:03:28,302
No, but perhaps that's cause
I'm intrinsically an optimist.

3110
02:03:28,302 --> 02:03:29,135
- [Fridman] Yeah.

3111
02:03:29,136 --> 02:03:32,384
- I mean, I think that
there are things, I,

3112
02:03:32,384 --> 02:03:35,770
I think the thing that one, you know,

3113
02:03:35,770 --> 02:03:39,018
one sees is there's going
to be this one thing

3114
02:03:39,018 --> 02:03:41,932
and it's going to just zap everything.

3115
02:03:41,932 --> 02:03:42,765
- [Fridman] Yeah.

3116
02:03:42,765 --> 02:03:43,726
Somehow, you know,

3117
02:03:43,726 --> 02:03:44,559
I maybe I have faith in
computational irreducible,

3118
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,560
so to speak,

3119
02:03:47,222 --> 02:03:50,755
that there's always unintended
little corners that,

3120
02:03:50,755 --> 02:03:53,503
you know, it's just like somebody
says, I'm going to, well,

3121
02:03:53,503 --> 02:03:54,336
I don't know.

3122
02:03:54,337 --> 02:03:55,170
Somebody has some,

3123
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:56,551
some bio weapon and they say,

3124
02:03:56,551 --> 02:03:59,278
we're gonna release this and
it's going to do all this harm.

3125
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:01,227
But then it turns out it's
more complicated than that

3126
02:04:01,226 --> 02:04:03,403
because, you know, the kind of,

3127
02:04:03,404 --> 02:04:05,294
some humans are different and you know,

3128
02:04:05,293 --> 02:04:07,376
the exact way it works
is a little different

3129
02:04:07,377 --> 02:04:08,369
than you expect.

3130
02:04:08,368 --> 02:04:10,779
It's something where sort of the, the,

3131
02:04:10,779 --> 02:04:12,506
the great big you, you know,

3132
02:04:12,506 --> 02:04:14,375
you smash the thing with
something, you know, you,

3133
02:04:14,375 --> 02:04:16,207
the asteroid collides with the earth.

3134
02:04:16,207 --> 02:04:17,488
- [Fridman] Yeah.

3135
02:04:17,488 --> 02:04:19,135
- And it kind of, you
know, and yes, you know,

3136
02:04:19,136 --> 02:04:22,141
the earth is cold for two years
or something and you know,

3137
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:25,152
then lots of things die,
but not everything dies.

3138
02:04:25,152 --> 02:04:28,268
And it's, you know, there's,
there's usually, I mean,

3139
02:04:28,268 --> 02:04:29,100
I I kind of,

3140
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:30,808
this is in a sense the sort of story

3141
02:04:30,809 --> 02:04:32,141
of computational disability.

3142
02:04:32,141 --> 02:04:34,118
There are always unexpected corners.

3143
02:04:34,118 --> 02:04:36,043
There are always unexpected consequences.

3144
02:04:36,043 --> 02:04:38,511
And I don't think that the
kind of whacked over the head

3145
02:04:38,511 --> 02:04:41,768
with something and then
it's all gone is, you know,

3146
02:04:41,769 --> 02:04:43,556
that can obviously happen.

3147
02:04:43,556 --> 02:04:45,782
The earth can be swallowed up
in a black hole or something,

3148
02:04:45,782 --> 02:04:49,786
and then it's kind of, presumably,
presumably all over the,

3149
02:04:49,786 --> 02:04:53,636
but, but, you know, I think
this question of, of what,

3150
02:04:53,636 --> 02:04:56,769
you know, what, what do I
think the realistic paths are?

3151
02:04:56,769 --> 02:05:00,387
I think that there will
be sort of an increasing,

3152
02:05:00,386 --> 02:05:01,390
I mean the,

3153
02:05:01,390 --> 02:05:04,324
the people have to get used to phenomena

3154
02:05:04,324 --> 02:05:06,020
like computational reducibility.

3155
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,845
There's an idea that we
built the machines so we can

3156
02:05:08,845 --> 02:05:11,684
understand what they do, and we are,

3157
02:05:11,685 --> 02:05:14,207
we are going to be able
to control what happens.

3158
02:05:14,207 --> 02:05:16,222
Well, that's not really right.

3159
02:05:16,221 --> 02:05:17,342
Now the question is,

3160
02:05:17,342 --> 02:05:21,323
is the result of that lack of
control going to be that the

3161
02:05:21,323 --> 02:05:25,065
machines kind of conspire
and sort of wipe us out?

3162
02:05:25,065 --> 02:05:26,911
Maybe just because I'm an optimist,

3163
02:05:26,911 --> 02:05:29,210
I don't tend to think
that that's, you know,

3164
02:05:29,210 --> 02:05:30,564
that's in the cards.

3165
02:05:30,564 --> 02:05:32,061
I think that the, you know,

3166
02:05:32,060 --> 02:05:35,701
as a realistic thing,
I, I suspect, you know,

3167
02:05:35,701 --> 02:05:39,672
what will sort of emerge maybe
is kind of an ecosystem of

3168
02:05:39,672 --> 02:05:43,621
the AIs, just as you know,
again, I I don't really know.

3169
02:05:43,622 --> 02:05:45,899
I mean, this is something
it's, it's hard to,

3170
02:05:45,899 --> 02:05:48,596
it's hard to be clear
about what will happen.

3171
02:05:48,595 --> 02:05:50,770
I mean, I think that
there, you know, there are,

3172
02:05:50,770 --> 02:05:53,081
there are a lot of sort
of details of, you know,

3173
02:05:53,082 --> 02:05:55,084
what could we do?

3174
02:05:55,083 --> 02:05:58,143
What systems in the world
could we connect an AI to,

3175
02:05:58,143 --> 02:05:59,011
you know, I have to say,

3176
02:05:59,011 --> 02:06:02,268
I was just a couple of days
ago I was working on this

3177
02:06:02,268 --> 02:06:07,172
ChatGPT plugin kit that we
have for orphan language. Okay?

3178
02:06:07,171 --> 02:06:09,000
Where you can, you know,

3179
02:06:09,001 --> 02:06:12,389
you can create a plugin and it
runs well from language code

3180
02:06:12,389 --> 02:06:14,596
and it can run Wolfram Language code

3181
02:06:14,596 --> 02:06:16,382
back on your own computer.

3182
02:06:16,382 --> 02:06:19,228
And I was thinking, well, I
can just make it, you know,

3183
02:06:19,229 --> 02:06:21,766
I can tell ChatGPT create a piece of code,

3184
02:06:21,766 --> 02:06:23,966
and then just run it on my computer.

3185
02:06:23,966 --> 02:06:25,496
And I'm like, you know, that,

3186
02:06:25,496 --> 02:06:28,167
that sort of personalizes
for me the what could,

3187
02:06:28,167 --> 02:06:30,409
what could possibly go wrong, so to speak.

3188
02:06:30,409 --> 02:06:33,490
- Was that exciting or
scary, that possibility?

3189
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:34,802
- It was a little bit scary actually,

3190
02:06:34,802 --> 02:06:37,538
because it's kind of like,
like I realize I'm, I'm,

3191
02:06:37,538 --> 02:06:40,788
I'm delegating to the AI,
just write a piece of code,

3192
02:06:40,788 --> 02:06:42,898
you know, you are in charge,
write a piece of code,

3193
02:06:42,899 --> 02:06:46,396
run it on my computer, and
pretty soon all my files can,

3194
02:06:46,395 --> 02:06:47,935
that's like delete.

3195
02:06:47,935 --> 02:06:49,466
- That's like a, that's
like Russian roulette,

3196
02:06:49,466 --> 02:06:51,509
but like much more
complicated version of that.

3197
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:52,762
- Yes, yes, yes. Right.

3198
02:06:52,762 --> 02:06:56,430
- That's a good drinking
game. I don't know.

3199
02:06:57,445 --> 02:07:00,166
- Right, I mean that, that's why,

3200
02:07:00,166 --> 02:07:02,628
it's an interesting question
then if, if you do that right?

3201
02:07:02,627 --> 02:07:04,449
Yeah. What is the sandboxing
that you should have?

3202
02:07:04,449 --> 02:07:07,462
And that's sort of a,
that's a, a version of,

3203
02:07:07,462 --> 02:07:08,644
of that question for the world.

3204
02:07:08,645 --> 02:07:11,231
That is, as soon as you put
The AIs in charge of things,

3205
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:12,274
you know, how much,

3206
02:07:12,274 --> 02:07:14,085
how many constraints should
there be on these systems before

3207
02:07:14,086 --> 02:07:18,539
you put the ais in charge of
all the weapons and all these,

3208
02:07:18,539 --> 02:07:20,595
you know, all these
different kinds of systems.

3209
02:07:20,595 --> 02:07:22,773
- Well, here's the fun
part about sandboxes

3210
02:07:22,774 --> 02:07:25,271
is the AI knows about them.

3211
02:07:25,270 --> 02:07:27,853
It has the tools to crack them.

3212
02:07:28,810 --> 02:07:31,442
- Look, the fundamental
problem of computer security.

3213
02:07:31,442 --> 02:07:33,216
Is computational irreducibility.

3214
02:07:33,216 --> 02:07:37,811
Because the fact is, any
sandbox is never any, you know,

3215
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:40,671
it's never gonna be a perfect
sandbox If you want the system

3216
02:07:40,671 --> 02:07:43,545
to be able to do interesting things.

3217
02:07:43,546 --> 02:07:45,404
I mean, this, this is the
problem that's happened,

3218
02:07:45,404 --> 02:07:47,316
the generic problem of computer security,

3219
02:07:47,315 --> 02:07:48,912
that as soon as you have your, you know,

3220
02:07:48,912 --> 02:07:51,795
firewall that is sophisticated
enough to be a universal

3221
02:07:51,796 --> 02:07:54,743
computer, that means it can do anything.

3222
02:07:54,743 --> 02:07:58,536
And so long as if you find
a way to poke it so that you

3223
02:07:58,536 --> 02:08:01,706
actually get it to do that
universal computation thing,

3224
02:08:01,706 --> 02:08:04,698
that's the way you kind of crawl
around and get it to do the

3225
02:08:04,698 --> 02:08:06,974
thing that it wasn't intended to do.

3226
02:08:06,974 --> 02:08:08,041
And that's sort of a,

3227
02:08:08,041 --> 02:08:11,615
another version of computational
irreducibility, is you can,

3228
02:08:11,615 --> 02:08:13,037
you know, you can kind of,

3229
02:08:13,037 --> 02:08:14,860
you get it to do the thing
you didn't expect it to do,

3230
02:08:14,859 --> 02:08:15,859
so to speak.

3231
02:08:16,695 --> 02:08:18,345
- There's so many
interesting possibilities

3232
02:08:18,345 --> 02:08:19,875
here that manifest themselves

3233
02:08:19,876 --> 02:08:22,976
from the compute computational
reducibility here

3234
02:08:22,975 --> 02:08:27,166
that it's just so many things
can happen because in digital

3235
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:29,687
space things move so quickly.
You can have a chat bot,

3236
02:08:29,686 --> 02:08:33,061
you can have a piece of code
that you could basically have

3237
02:08:33,061 --> 02:08:35,992
ChatGPT generate viruses
accidentally or on purpose

3238
02:08:35,993 --> 02:08:38,466
and they digital viruses.

3239
02:08:38,466 --> 02:08:39,670
- [Wolfram] Yes.

3240
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:42,002
- And they could be brain viruses too.

3241
02:08:42,002 --> 02:08:45,173
They, they convince kind
of like phishing emails.

3242
02:08:45,173 --> 02:08:46,518
- [Wolfram] Yes.

3243
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:47,934
- They can convince you of stuff.

3244
02:08:47,934 --> 02:08:49,472
- Yes. And no doubt you can, you know,

3245
02:08:49,472 --> 02:08:51,158
in a sense we've had the,

3246
02:08:51,158 --> 02:08:54,568
the loop of the machine learning
loop of making things that

3247
02:08:54,569 --> 02:08:56,344
convince people of things.

3248
02:08:56,344 --> 02:08:57,957
Is surely going to get easier to do.

3249
02:08:57,957 --> 02:08:59,026
- [Fridman] Yeah.

3250
02:08:59,025 --> 02:09:01,817
- And you know, then
what does that look like?

3251
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:05,680
Well it's again, you know, we,
humans are, you know, we're,

3252
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:09,958
this is a new environment
for us and admittedly it's an

3253
02:09:09,957 --> 02:09:12,170
environment which a little bit scarily is,

3254
02:09:12,171 --> 02:09:15,680
is changing much more rapidly
than, I mean, you know,

3255
02:09:15,680 --> 02:09:16,668
people worry about, you know,

3256
02:09:16,668 --> 02:09:19,583
climate change is gonna happen
over hundreds of years and,

3257
02:09:19,583 --> 02:09:21,324
you know, the environment is changing,

3258
02:09:21,324 --> 02:09:23,699
but the environment for, you know, in the,

3259
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:26,141
the kind of digital
environment might change

3260
02:09:26,141 --> 02:09:27,667
in six months.

3261
02:09:27,667 --> 02:09:31,528
- So one of the relevant concerns here

3262
02:09:31,529 --> 02:09:35,443
in terms of the impact of GPT on society

3263
02:09:35,443 --> 02:09:39,536
is the nature of truth that's
relevant to Wolfram Alpha.

3264
02:09:39,536 --> 02:09:42,507
Because computation
through symbolic reasoning

3265
02:09:42,507 --> 02:09:46,135
that's embodied in Wolfram
Alpha as the interface.

3266
02:09:46,135 --> 02:09:49,018
There's a kind of sense
that what Wolfram Alpha

3267
02:09:49,018 --> 02:09:51,055
tells me is true.

3268
02:09:51,055 --> 02:09:52,137
- So we hope.

3269
02:09:53,088 --> 02:09:56,202
- Yeah, I mean you could
probably analyze that.

3270
02:09:56,202 --> 02:09:59,449
You could show you can't prove
that's always gonna be true

3271
02:09:59,448 --> 02:10:01,472
computation reducibility,

3272
02:10:01,472 --> 02:10:04,555
but it's gonna be more true than not.

3273
02:10:06,418 --> 02:10:07,251
- It's, look,

3274
02:10:07,252 --> 02:10:10,081
the fact is it will be the
correct consequence of the rules

3275
02:10:10,081 --> 02:10:13,288
you've specified and
insofar as it talks about

3276
02:10:13,288 --> 02:10:15,036
the real world, you know,

3277
02:10:15,037 --> 02:10:19,261
that is our job in sort of
curating and collecting data to

3278
02:10:19,261 --> 02:10:22,700
make sure that that data is
quotes as true as possible.

3279
02:10:22,699 --> 02:10:24,724
Now what does that mean? Well, you know,

3280
02:10:24,724 --> 02:10:26,440
it's always an interesting question.

3281
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:27,609
I mean, for us,

3282
02:10:27,609 --> 02:10:32,350
our operational definition
of truth is, you know,

3283
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:35,141
somebody says, who's the best actress?

3284
02:10:35,141 --> 02:10:36,680
Who knows?

3285
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:38,851
But somebody won the Oscar.

3286
02:10:38,851 --> 02:10:40,742
And that's a definite fact.

3287
02:10:40,742 --> 02:10:41,721
And so, you know,

3288
02:10:41,721 --> 02:10:44,789
that's the kind of thing that
we can make computational as a

3289
02:10:44,789 --> 02:10:45,622
piece of truth.

3290
02:10:45,622 --> 02:10:46,529
- [Fridman] Yeah.

3291
02:10:46,529 --> 02:10:49,336
- If you ask, you know,
these things which, you know,

3292
02:10:49,337 --> 02:10:52,099
a sensor measured this
thing, it did it this way,

3293
02:10:52,099 --> 02:10:53,628
a machine learning system,

3294
02:10:53,627 --> 02:10:55,460
this particular machine learning system

3295
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:56,978
recognized this thing.

3296
02:10:56,978 --> 02:11:00,703
That's a, that's a sort
of a definite a fact,

3297
02:11:00,703 --> 02:11:01,992
so to speak.

3298
02:11:01,993 --> 02:11:04,851
And that's, you know, there are,

3299
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:08,019
there is a good network of
those things in the world.

3300
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:09,261
It's certainly the case that,

3301
02:11:09,261 --> 02:11:13,134
particularly when you say
is so-and-so a good person.

3302
02:11:13,134 --> 02:11:16,444
You know, that's a, that's
a hopelessly you know,

3303
02:11:16,444 --> 02:11:19,736
we might have a computational
language definition of good.

3304
02:11:19,735 --> 02:11:22,395
I don't think it'd be very
interesting cause that's a very

3305
02:11:22,395 --> 02:11:24,364
messy kind of concept.

3306
02:11:24,364 --> 02:11:28,193
Not really amenable to
kind of, you know, the,

3307
02:11:28,193 --> 02:11:30,726
I think as far as we will get
with those kinds of things

3308
02:11:30,725 --> 02:11:31,643
is I want X

3309
02:11:32,809 --> 02:11:36,414
There's a kind of meaningful
calculus of I want X

3310
02:11:36,414 --> 02:11:38,237
and that has various consequences.

3311
02:11:38,237 --> 02:11:39,202
I mean, I'm not sure, I haven't,

3312
02:11:39,202 --> 02:11:41,024
I haven't thought this
through properly, but I think,

3313
02:11:41,024 --> 02:11:44,012
you know, a concept like,
is so-and-so a good person?

3314
02:11:44,011 --> 02:11:45,672
Is that true or not?

3315
02:11:45,672 --> 02:11:47,405
That's a mess.

3316
02:11:47,405 --> 02:11:50,917
- That's a mess That's
amenable to computation.

3317
02:11:50,917 --> 02:11:51,750
I think,

3318
02:11:51,751 --> 02:11:54,679
I think it's a mess when humans
try to define what's good,

3319
02:11:54,679 --> 02:11:57,055
like through legislation.

3320
02:11:57,055 --> 02:11:59,015
But when humans try to
define what's good through

3321
02:11:59,015 --> 02:12:03,360
literature, through history
books, through poetry,

3322
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:04,327
it starts being, well.

3323
02:12:04,328 --> 02:12:05,865
- I don't know. I mean
that particular thing,

3324
02:12:05,865 --> 02:12:08,220
it's kind of like, you know, we're,

3325
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:10,981
we're we're going into
kind of the ethics of what,

3326
02:12:10,980 --> 02:12:13,081
what counts as good, so to speak.

3327
02:12:13,082 --> 02:12:17,440
And, you know, what do we
think is right and so on.

3328
02:12:17,439 --> 02:12:19,671
And I think that's a, a
thing which, you know,

3329
02:12:19,671 --> 02:12:23,764
one feature is we don't
all agree about that.

3330
02:12:23,765 --> 02:12:27,296
There's no theorems about
kind of, you know, there's no,

3331
02:12:27,296 --> 02:12:30,706
there's no theoretical
framework that says this is,

3332
02:12:30,706 --> 02:12:34,003
this is the way that ethics has to be.

3333
02:12:34,003 --> 02:12:34,943
- Well first of all,

3334
02:12:34,943 --> 02:12:37,931
there's stuff we kind of agree
on and there's some empirical

3335
02:12:37,930 --> 02:12:40,944
backing for what works and
what doesn't from just even the

3336
02:12:40,944 --> 02:12:44,224
morals and ethics within religious texts.

3337
02:12:44,224 --> 02:12:47,886
So we seem to mostly
agree that murder is bad,

3338
02:12:47,886 --> 02:12:50,153
the certain universals
that seem to emerge.

3339
02:12:50,153 --> 02:12:53,582
- I wonder whether the
murder of an AI is bad.

3340
02:12:53,582 --> 02:12:56,332
- Well, I tend to think yes, but,

3341
02:12:57,662 --> 02:13:00,896
and I think we're gonna have
to contend with that question.

3342
02:13:00,896 --> 02:13:03,271
Oh, and I wonder what AI would say.

3343
02:13:03,271 --> 02:13:05,704
- Yeah. Well I think, you
know, one of the things with,

3344
02:13:05,704 --> 02:13:06,537
with AI is,

3345
02:13:06,537 --> 02:13:10,787
is it's one thing to wipe
out that AI that is only,

3346
02:13:11,832 --> 02:13:13,505
you know, has no owner.

3347
02:13:13,505 --> 02:13:16,573
You can easily imagine an AI
kind of hanging out on the,

3348
02:13:16,573 --> 02:13:18,256
on the, you know, on,

3349
02:13:18,256 --> 02:13:20,789
on the internet without
having any particular owner

3350
02:13:20,788 --> 02:13:21,996
or anything like that.

3351
02:13:21,996 --> 02:13:25,296
And then you say, well, well
what harm does it, you know,

3352
02:13:25,296 --> 02:13:28,641
it, it's, it's okay to get rid of that AI.

3353
02:13:28,641 --> 02:13:31,720
Cause if the AI has 10,000
friends who are humans

3354
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:32,908
and all those, you know,

3355
02:13:32,908 --> 02:13:35,472
all those 10,000 humans
will be incredibly upset

3356
02:13:35,471 --> 02:13:38,408
that this AI just got exterminated.

3357
02:13:38,408 --> 02:13:41,310
It becomes a slightly
different, more entangled story.

3358
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:42,565
But yeah, no, I think that,

3359
02:13:42,565 --> 02:13:45,390
that this question about
what do humans agree about?

3360
02:13:45,390 --> 02:13:48,594
It's, you know, there are certain,

3361
02:13:48,594 --> 02:13:50,880
there's certain things that, you know,

3362
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:55,701
human laws have tended to
consistently agree about.

3363
02:13:55,701 --> 02:13:56,569
You know,

3364
02:13:56,569 --> 02:13:59,372
there have been times in
history when people have sort of

3365
02:13:59,372 --> 02:14:02,354
gone away from certain kinds of laws,

3366
02:14:02,354 --> 02:14:03,972
even ones that we would now say,

3367
02:14:03,972 --> 02:14:06,644
how could you possibly have
not not done it that way?

3368
02:14:06,645 --> 02:14:09,263
You know, that just
doesn't seem right at all.

3369
02:14:09,262 --> 02:14:10,515
But I think,

3370
02:14:10,515 --> 02:14:15,387
I mean this question of what
I don't think one can say

3371
02:14:15,386 --> 02:14:16,753
beyond saying,

3372
02:14:16,753 --> 02:14:20,194
if you have a set of rules that
will cause the species to go

3373
02:14:20,194 --> 02:14:23,828
extinct, that's probably, you know,

3374
02:14:23,828 --> 02:14:26,971
you could say that's probably
not a, a winning set of laws.

3375
02:14:26,971 --> 02:14:29,898
Because even to have a thing
on which you can operate laws

3376
02:14:29,898 --> 02:14:32,778
requires that the species not be extinct.

3377
02:14:32,778 --> 02:14:35,221
- But between sort of what's the distance

3378
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:38,099
between Chicago and New York that

3379
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:40,344
Wolfram Alpha can answer and the question

3380
02:14:40,344 --> 02:14:43,329
of if this person is good or not,

3381
02:14:43,329 --> 02:14:45,462
there seems to be a lot of gray area.

3382
02:14:45,462 --> 02:14:47,541
And that starts becoming
really interesting.

3383
02:14:47,542 --> 02:14:48,625
I think your,

3384
02:14:49,938 --> 02:14:52,511
since the creation of Wolfram
Alpha have been a kind of

3385
02:14:52,511 --> 02:14:55,713
arbiter of truth at a, at a large scale.

3386
02:14:55,712 --> 02:14:58,308
So this system is
generates more truth than.

3387
02:14:58,309 --> 02:15:00,238
- Try to make sure that
the things are true.

3388
02:15:00,238 --> 02:15:02,217
I mean, look, as a practical matter

3389
02:15:02,216 --> 02:15:04,850
when people write computational contracts

3390
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:06,769
and it's kind of like, you know,

3391
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:09,701
if this happens in the
world, then do this.

3392
02:15:09,701 --> 02:15:12,527
And this hasn't developed as,

3393
02:15:12,527 --> 02:15:14,509
as quickly as it might have done.

3394
02:15:14,509 --> 02:15:16,542
You know, this has been a
sort of a blockchain story

3395
02:15:16,542 --> 02:15:17,545
in part and so on.

3396
02:15:17,545 --> 02:15:19,457
Although blockchain's not
really necessary for the idea of

3397
02:15:19,457 --> 02:15:20,996
computational contracts.

3398
02:15:20,997 --> 02:15:23,825
But you can imagine that
eventually sort of a large part of

3399
02:15:23,824 --> 02:15:26,849
what's in the world are these
giant chains and networks of

3400
02:15:26,849 --> 02:15:30,431
computational contracts
and then something happens

3401
02:15:30,431 --> 02:15:31,510
in the world.

3402
02:15:31,511 --> 02:15:34,343
And this whole giant domino
effect of contracts firing

3403
02:15:34,342 --> 02:15:37,769
autonomously that cause
other things to happen.

3404
02:15:37,769 --> 02:15:39,813
And you know, for us, you know,

3405
02:15:39,813 --> 02:15:43,181
we've been the main sort
of source, the oracle of,

3406
02:15:43,180 --> 02:15:46,698
of quotes facts or truth or
something for things like

3407
02:15:46,698 --> 02:15:49,403
blockchain, computational
contracts and such.

3408
02:15:49,404 --> 02:15:52,868
Like, and there's a question
of, you know, what, you know,

3409
02:15:52,868 --> 02:15:54,541
I consider that responsibility

3410
02:15:54,541 --> 02:15:56,610
to actually get the stuff right.

3411
02:15:56,609 --> 02:16:00,192
And one of the things
that is tricky sometimes

3412
02:16:00,193 --> 02:16:01,025
is when is it true?

3413
02:16:01,025 --> 02:16:01,858
When is it a fact?

3414
02:16:01,859 --> 02:16:02,692
When is it not a fact?

3415
02:16:02,692 --> 02:16:03,524
- Yes.

3416
02:16:03,524 --> 02:16:07,942
- I think the best we can
do is to say, you know, we,

3417
02:16:08,793 --> 02:16:12,073
we have a procedure, we
follow the procedure,

3418
02:16:12,073 --> 02:16:14,052
we might get it wrong,

3419
02:16:14,052 --> 02:16:16,581
but at least we won't be
corrupt about getting it wrong,

3420
02:16:16,581 --> 02:16:17,868
so to speak.

3421
02:16:17,868 --> 02:16:19,969
- So that's beautifully
put and have a transparency

3422
02:16:19,969 --> 02:16:21,636
about the procedure.

3423
02:16:23,454 --> 02:16:28,184
The problem starts to emerge
when the things that you

3424
02:16:28,184 --> 02:16:31,265
convert into computational
language start to expand,

3425
02:16:31,265 --> 02:16:33,532
for example, into the realm of politics.

3426
02:16:33,531 --> 02:16:36,066
So this is where it's
almost like this nice dance

3427
02:16:36,066 --> 02:16:38,483
of Wolfram Alpha and ChatGPT,

3428
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:43,000
like you said is shallow and broad.

3429
02:16:44,869 --> 02:16:47,980
So it's, it's, it's gonna give
you an opinion on everything.

3430
02:16:47,980 --> 02:16:49,995
- But it writes fiction as well as fact,

3431
02:16:49,995 --> 02:16:52,345
which is exactly how it's
built. I mean that's exactly,

3432
02:16:52,345 --> 02:16:57,345
it is making language and it
is making both even in code,

3433
02:16:57,771 --> 02:16:59,367
it writes fiction.

3434
02:16:59,367 --> 02:17:01,453
I mean, it's kind of fun
to see sometimes, you know,

3435
02:17:01,453 --> 02:17:03,864
it'll write fictional war
from language code. Yeah.

3436
02:17:03,864 --> 02:17:04,966
That, that it kind of.

3437
02:17:04,966 --> 02:17:06,846
- [Fridman] It kinda looks right.

3438
02:17:06,846 --> 02:17:08,804
- Yeah it looks right,
but it's actually not

3439
02:17:08,804 --> 02:17:11,025
pragmatically correct.

3440
02:17:11,025 --> 02:17:13,172
But, but yes, it's, it's a,

3441
02:17:13,172 --> 02:17:17,944
it has a view of kind of
roughly how the world works at,

3442
02:17:17,944 --> 02:17:18,992
at the same level as,

3443
02:17:18,992 --> 02:17:22,620
as books of fiction talk about
roughly how the world works.

3444
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:25,518
They just don't happen to be
the way the world actually

3445
02:17:25,518 --> 02:17:26,627
worked or whatever.

3446
02:17:26,627 --> 02:17:28,315
But yes, that, that's, no, I,

3447
02:17:28,315 --> 02:17:32,824
I agree that's sort of a, you
know, we are attempting with,

3448
02:17:32,824 --> 02:17:34,891
with our whole, you
know, Wolfram language,

3449
02:17:34,891 --> 02:17:39,876
computational language
thing to represent at least,

3450
02:17:39,876 --> 02:17:41,163
well it's either,

3451
02:17:41,163 --> 02:17:42,996
it doesn't necessarily have have to be

3452
02:17:42,995 --> 02:17:44,314
how the actual world works.

3453
02:17:44,315 --> 02:17:46,954
Cause we can invent a set of
rules that aren't the way the

3454
02:17:46,954 --> 02:17:49,682
actual world works and run those rules.

3455
02:17:49,682 --> 02:17:52,530
But then we are saying we are
going to accurately represent

3456
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:55,512
the results of running those rules,

3457
02:17:55,512 --> 02:17:58,174
which might or might not be
the actual rules of the world,

3458
02:17:58,174 --> 02:18:01,702
but we also are trying to
capture features of the world as

3459
02:18:01,701 --> 02:18:04,659
accurately as possible to represent

3460
02:18:04,659 --> 02:18:05,801
what happens in the world.

3461
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:08,154
Now again, as we've
discussed, you know, the,

3462
02:18:08,155 --> 02:18:12,140
the atoms in the world
arranged, you know, you say,

3463
02:18:12,139 --> 02:18:16,724
I don't know, you know, was
there a tank that showed up?

3464
02:18:16,725 --> 02:18:20,036
You know, that, that, you
know, drove somewhere.

3465
02:18:20,036 --> 02:18:22,630
Okay, well, you know, what is a tank?

3466
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:26,877
It's an arrangement of
atoms that we abstractly

3467
02:18:26,878 --> 02:18:29,001
describe as a tank.

3468
02:18:29,001 --> 02:18:31,300
And you could say, well, you know,

3469
02:18:31,299 --> 02:18:33,157
there's some arrangement of
atoms that is a different

3470
02:18:33,157 --> 02:18:35,887
arrangement of atoms, but
it's, and it's not, you know,

3471
02:18:35,888 --> 02:18:37,854
we didn't, we didn't decide.

3472
02:18:37,853 --> 02:18:41,266
It's like this observer theory
question of, you know, what,

3473
02:18:41,266 --> 02:18:43,279
what arrangement of atoms counts as a tank

3474
02:18:43,279 --> 02:18:45,006
versus not a tank.

3475
02:18:45,005 --> 02:18:45,838
- So there's,

3476
02:18:45,838 --> 02:18:49,074
there's even things that
would consider strong facts.

3477
02:18:49,074 --> 02:18:52,409
You could start to kind of
disassemble them and show that

3478
02:18:52,409 --> 02:18:54,233
they're not-

3479
02:18:54,233 --> 02:18:55,236
- Absolutely.

3480
02:18:55,236 --> 02:18:56,950
I mean, so, so the
question of whether, oh,

3481
02:18:56,950 --> 02:18:57,783
I don't know,

3482
02:18:57,782 --> 02:19:00,835
was this gust of wind
strong enough to blow over

3483
02:19:00,835 --> 02:19:02,738
this particular thing?

3484
02:19:02,738 --> 02:19:05,212
Well, a gust of wind is
a complicated concept.

3485
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:06,046
You know,

3486
02:19:06,046 --> 02:19:09,327
it's full of little pieces
of fluid dynamics and little

3487
02:19:09,327 --> 02:19:10,457
vortices here and there.

3488
02:19:10,458 --> 02:19:12,230
And you have to define, you know, was it,

3489
02:19:12,229 --> 02:19:15,103
you know what the aspect of
the gust of wind that you care

3490
02:19:15,103 --> 02:19:18,324
about might be it put this
amount of pressure on this,

3491
02:19:18,325 --> 02:19:20,879
you know, blade of some, some, you know,

3492
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:22,438
wind turbine or something.

3493
02:19:22,438 --> 02:19:27,167
And you know that that's
the, and but, but you know,

3494
02:19:27,167 --> 02:19:28,058
if you say,

3495
02:19:28,058 --> 02:19:31,194
if you have something which is
the fact of the gust of wind

3496
02:19:31,194 --> 02:19:36,194
was this strong or whatever,
that, you know, that is you,

3497
02:19:36,222 --> 02:19:37,849
you, you have to have
some definition of that.

3498
02:19:37,849 --> 02:19:39,916
You have to have some
measuring device that says,

3499
02:19:39,916 --> 02:19:42,206
according to my measuring
device that was constructed this

3500
02:19:42,206 --> 02:19:44,184
way, the gust of wind was this.

3501
02:19:44,184 --> 02:19:46,363
- So what can you say
about the nature of truth

3502
02:19:46,363 --> 02:19:50,013
that's useful for us
to understand chat GPT?

3503
02:19:50,013 --> 02:19:53,027
Because you've been con, you've
been contending with this

3504
02:19:53,028 --> 02:19:54,569
idea of what is fact and not,

3505
02:19:54,569 --> 02:19:58,236
and it seems like ChatGPT
is used a lot now,

3506
02:19:59,145 --> 02:20:03,245
I've seen it used by
journalists to write articles.

3507
02:20:03,245 --> 02:20:06,692
And so you have people that
are working with large language

3508
02:20:06,691 --> 02:20:09,683
models trying to desperately
figure out how do we

3509
02:20:09,683 --> 02:20:14,290
essentially censor them
through different mechanisms,

3510
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:18,163
either manually or through
reinforcement learning with human

3511
02:20:18,164 --> 02:20:20,747
feedback, try to align them to,

3512
02:20:21,816 --> 02:20:23,751
to not say fiction,

3513
02:20:23,751 --> 02:20:26,478
just to say non-fiction
as much as possible.

3514
02:20:26,477 --> 02:20:28,527
- Well this is the importance
of computational language

3515
02:20:28,528 --> 02:20:30,134
as an intermediate,

3516
02:20:30,134 --> 02:20:32,091
it's kind of like you've got
the large language model,

3517
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:35,041
it's able to surface
something which is a formal,

3518
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,579
precise thing.

3519
02:20:36,579 --> 02:20:39,584
That you can then look at and
you can run tests on it and

3520
02:20:39,584 --> 02:20:41,409
you can do all kinds of things.

3521
02:20:41,409 --> 02:20:43,137
It's always gonna work the same way.

3522
02:20:43,138 --> 02:20:45,261
And it's precisely defined what it does.

3523
02:20:45,261 --> 02:20:47,547
And then the large language
model is the interface.

3524
02:20:47,547 --> 02:20:49,683
I mean, the way I view
these large language models,

3525
02:20:49,683 --> 02:20:50,784
one of their important, I mean,

3526
02:20:50,783 --> 02:20:52,323
there are many use cases and you know,

3527
02:20:52,323 --> 02:20:53,996
it's a remarkable thing to
talk about some of these,

3528
02:20:53,995 --> 02:20:55,754
you know, literally, you know,

3529
02:20:55,754 --> 02:20:58,580
every day we're coming up with
a couple of new use cases,

3530
02:20:58,581 --> 02:21:00,186
some of which are very, very,

3531
02:21:00,186 --> 02:21:03,948
very surprising and things where, I mean,

3532
02:21:03,948 --> 02:21:07,711
but the best use cases are
ones where it's, you know,

3533
02:21:07,711 --> 02:21:11,162
even if it gets it roughly
right, it's still a huge win.

3534
02:21:11,163 --> 02:21:14,167
Like a use case we had from
a week or two ago is read our

3535
02:21:14,167 --> 02:21:15,719
bug reports.

3536
02:21:15,719 --> 02:21:17,807
You know, we've got hundreds of thousands

3537
02:21:17,808 --> 02:21:19,345
of bug reports that have,

3538
02:21:19,344 --> 02:21:21,108
we've accumulated over decades.

3539
02:21:21,109 --> 02:21:22,220
And it's like, you know,

3540
02:21:22,219 --> 02:21:24,406
can we have it just read the bug report,

3541
02:21:24,406 --> 02:21:28,007
figure out where the, where
is the bug likely to be?

3542
02:21:28,007 --> 02:21:30,173
And, you know, hone in
on that piece of code.

3543
02:21:30,173 --> 02:21:32,382
Maybe it'll even suggest
some, some, you know,

3544
02:21:32,381 --> 02:21:34,639
sort of way to fix the code.

3545
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:35,641
It might get that,

3546
02:21:35,641 --> 02:21:38,138
it might be nonsense what it
says to about how to fix the

3547
02:21:38,138 --> 02:21:41,612
code, but it's incredibly
useful that it was able to,

3548
02:21:41,612 --> 02:21:42,445
you know.

3549
02:21:43,538 --> 02:21:45,220
- [Fridman] Yeah. So awesome.

3550
02:21:45,219 --> 02:21:46,516
It's so awesome because even
the nonsense will somehow be

3551
02:21:46,516 --> 02:21:48,994
instructive. I don't, I don't
quite understand that yet.

3552
02:21:48,994 --> 02:21:50,754
I've, I've, yeah,

3553
02:21:50,754 --> 02:21:53,493
there's so many
programming related things.

3554
02:21:53,493 --> 02:21:55,022
Like for example,

3555
02:21:55,022 --> 02:21:57,592
translating from one programming
language to another is

3556
02:21:57,592 --> 02:21:59,760
really, really interesting.

3557
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,640
It's extremely effective, but then you,

3558
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:05,449
the failures reveal the path forward also.

3559
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:08,132
- Yeah. But I think, I mean
the, the, the big thing,

3560
02:22:08,131 --> 02:22:10,011
I mean in, in that kind of discussion,

3561
02:22:10,012 --> 02:22:12,918
the unique thing about our
computational language is it was

3562
02:22:12,917 --> 02:22:13,751
intended to be read by humans.

3563
02:22:13,751 --> 02:22:16,246
- [Fridman] Yes. That's really important.

3564
02:22:16,246 --> 02:22:18,360
- Right? And so it has this
thing where you can, but,

3565
02:22:18,361 --> 02:22:19,194
but you know,

3566
02:22:19,193 --> 02:22:22,278
thinking about sort of
ChatGPT and its use and so on.

3567
02:22:22,278 --> 02:22:24,018
The, one of the big things about it,

3568
02:22:24,018 --> 02:22:26,326
I think is it's a
linguistic user interface.

3569
02:22:26,325 --> 02:22:28,592
That is, so a typical use case might be,

3570
02:22:28,593 --> 02:22:31,719
and then take the journalist
case for example, it's like,

3571
02:22:31,718 --> 02:22:36,072
let's say I have five facts
that I'm trying to turn into an

3572
02:22:36,073 --> 02:22:37,986
article, or I'm trying to,

3573
02:22:37,986 --> 02:22:41,485
I'm trying to write a report
where I have basically five

3574
02:22:41,485 --> 02:22:44,093
facts that I'm trying to
include in this report.

3575
02:22:44,093 --> 02:22:47,248
But then I feed those
five facts to ChatGPT,

3576
02:22:47,247 --> 02:22:50,359
it puffs them out into
this big report and then,

3577
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:53,525
and then that's a good
interface for another.

3578
02:22:53,525 --> 02:22:57,025
If I just gave, if I just had in my terms,

3579
02:22:58,070 --> 02:23:00,444
those five bullet points
and I gave 'em to some other

3580
02:23:00,444 --> 02:23:02,325
person, the person will say,

3581
02:23:02,325 --> 02:23:03,860
I dunno what you're talking
about because these are,

3582
02:23:03,861 --> 02:23:04,694
you know,

3583
02:23:04,693 --> 02:23:06,913
this is your version of this
sort of quick notes about these

3584
02:23:06,914 --> 02:23:08,396
five bullet points.

3585
02:23:08,396 --> 02:23:09,992
But if you puff it out into this thing,

3586
02:23:09,992 --> 02:23:12,744
which is kind of connects to
the collective understanding of

3587
02:23:12,744 --> 02:23:15,582
language, then somebody else
can look at it and say, okay,

3588
02:23:15,582 --> 02:23:17,475
I understand what you're talking about.

3589
02:23:17,475 --> 02:23:20,192
Now you can also have a situation
where that thing that was

3590
02:23:20,191 --> 02:23:23,106
puffed out is fed to another
large language model.

3591
02:23:23,106 --> 02:23:24,479
You know, it's kind of like, you know,

3592
02:23:24,479 --> 02:23:28,815
you are applying for the permit
to, you know, I don't know,

3593
02:23:28,816 --> 02:23:31,645
grow fish in someplace
or something like this.

3594
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:33,953
And it, you know, it it, and,

3595
02:23:33,952 --> 02:23:37,247
and you have these facts that
you're putting in, you know,

3596
02:23:37,247 --> 02:23:40,233
I'm gonna have a, a, you
know, I'm gonna, you know,

3597
02:23:40,233 --> 02:23:42,280
have this kind of water and
I don't know what it's, yes.

3598
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:44,467
You just got a few bullet points.

3599
02:23:44,467 --> 02:23:48,087
It puffs it out into this big
application, you fill it out.

3600
02:23:48,086 --> 02:23:49,638
Then at the other end, the, you know,

3601
02:23:49,638 --> 02:23:53,016
the Fisheries Bureau has another
large language model that

3602
02:23:53,016 --> 02:23:55,950
just crushes it down because
the Fisheries Bureau cares

3603
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:59,954
about these three points and
it knows what it cares about.

3604
02:23:59,954 --> 02:24:02,388
And it then, so it's really the,

3605
02:24:02,388 --> 02:24:04,677
the natural language produced
by the larger language model

3606
02:24:04,676 --> 02:24:07,304
is sort of a transport
layer that, you know,

3607
02:24:07,304 --> 02:24:09,471
is really LLM communicates
with LLM I mean,

3608
02:24:09,471 --> 02:24:11,538
it's kind of like the, you know,

3609
02:24:11,538 --> 02:24:14,520
I write a piece of email
using my LLM and, you know,

3610
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:17,863
puff it out from the things
I want to say your LLM turns

3611
02:24:17,862 --> 02:24:20,898
it into and the conclusion is X.

3612
02:24:20,898 --> 02:24:22,558
Now the issue is, you know,

3613
02:24:22,558 --> 02:24:27,443
that the thing is going to
make this thing that is sort of

3614
02:24:27,443 --> 02:24:29,247
semantically plausible,

3615
02:24:29,247 --> 02:24:33,602
and it might not actually
be what you, you know,

3616
02:24:33,602 --> 02:24:37,047
it might not be kind of relate
to the world in the way that

3617
02:24:37,048 --> 02:24:38,676
you think it should relate to the world.

3618
02:24:38,675 --> 02:24:41,006
Now I, I've seen this, you
know, I, I've been doing, okay,

3619
02:24:41,006 --> 02:24:43,132
I'll give you a couple of examples.

3620
02:24:43,132 --> 02:24:45,575
I was doing this thing
when we announced this,

3621
02:24:45,575 --> 02:24:49,049
this plugin for, for, for ChatGPT.

3622
02:24:49,049 --> 02:24:51,667
I had this lovely example
of a math word problem,

3623
02:24:51,667 --> 02:24:53,362
some complicated thing.

3624
02:24:53,362 --> 02:24:56,299
And it did a spectacular job
of taking apart this elaborate

3625
02:24:56,299 --> 02:24:57,825
thing about, you know,

3626
02:24:57,825 --> 02:25:00,843
this person has twice as many
chickens as this, et cetera,

3627
02:25:00,843 --> 02:25:01,765
et cetera, et cetera.

3628
02:25:01,765 --> 02:25:03,659
And it turned into, into
a bunch of equations,

3629
02:25:03,659 --> 02:25:06,781
it fed them to Wolfram language.
We solved the equations,

3630
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:08,990
everybody did great.

3631
02:25:08,990 --> 02:25:10,894
We gave back the results.

3632
02:25:10,894 --> 02:25:11,774
And I thought, okay,

3633
02:25:11,774 --> 02:25:14,105
I'm gonna put this in this
blog post I'm writing. Okay.

3634
02:25:14,105 --> 02:25:16,174
I thought I'd better just check.

3635
02:25:16,174 --> 02:25:18,581
And turns out it got everything,

3636
02:25:18,582 --> 02:25:21,346
all the hard stuff it got
right at the very end.

3637
02:25:21,346 --> 02:25:22,390
Last two lines.

3638
02:25:22,390 --> 02:25:25,661
It just completely goofed it
up and gave the wrong answer.

3639
02:25:25,661 --> 02:25:27,647
And I would not have noticed
this same thing happened to me

3640
02:25:27,647 --> 02:25:29,805
two days ago. Okay.

3641
02:25:29,805 --> 02:25:31,456
So I, I thought, you know, I,

3642
02:25:31,456 --> 02:25:33,700
I made this with this ChatGPT plugin kit.

3643
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:36,950
I made a thing that would emit a sound,

3644
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:41,167
would play a tune on my
local computer. Right.

3645
02:25:41,167 --> 02:25:44,313
So ChatGPT would produce, you know,

3646
02:25:44,313 --> 02:25:46,987
a series of notes and
it would play this tune

3647
02:25:46,987 --> 02:25:47,820
on my computer.

3648
02:25:47,820 --> 02:25:48,654
Very cool.

3649
02:25:48,654 --> 02:25:49,487
Okay. So I thought,

3650
02:25:49,486 --> 02:25:54,059
I'm gonna ask it play the tune
that Hal sang when Hal was

3651
02:25:54,059 --> 02:25:56,654
being disconnected in 2001.

3652
02:25:56,655 --> 02:25:59,363
Okay. So it, it, there it is.

3653
02:25:59,362 --> 02:26:00,893
- Daisy. Was it Daisy?

3654
02:26:00,893 --> 02:26:03,033
- Yes, Daisy, yes.

3655
02:26:03,033 --> 02:26:03,867
Yeah. Right.

3656
02:26:03,867 --> 02:26:05,224
So, so, okay.

3657
02:26:05,224 --> 02:26:06,347
So I think, you know,

3658
02:26:06,347 --> 02:26:08,016
and so it produces a bunch
of notes and I'm like,

3659
02:26:08,016 --> 02:26:10,380
this is spectacular.

3660
02:26:10,380 --> 02:26:11,271
This is amazing.

3661
02:26:11,272 --> 02:26:12,415
And then I thought, you know,

3662
02:26:12,415 --> 02:26:14,321
I was just gonna put it in
and then I thought I better

3663
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,476
actually play this.

3664
02:26:15,476 --> 02:26:18,688
And so I did. And it was
Mary had a little Lamb.

3665
02:26:18,688 --> 02:26:19,521
- Oh wow.

3666
02:26:21,218 --> 02:26:22,758
Oh wow.

3667
02:26:22,757 --> 02:26:24,572
But it was, Mary had a little lamb.

3668
02:26:24,572 --> 02:26:26,595
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

3669
02:26:26,595 --> 02:26:27,429
- Wow.

3670
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:28,832
So it was correct but wrong.

3671
02:26:28,832 --> 02:26:29,665
It was, yeah.

3672
02:26:29,665 --> 02:26:32,291
You could easily be mistaken.

3673
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:33,123
- Yes. Right.

3674
02:26:33,123 --> 02:26:34,807
And in fact, I, I kind of gave the,

3675
02:26:34,807 --> 02:26:38,472
I had this quote from Hal
to explain, you know, it's,

3676
02:26:38,471 --> 02:26:41,189
it's as it the, the Hal you
know, states in the movie,

3677
02:26:41,189 --> 02:26:44,095
you know, it's the Hal 9,000 is, you know,

3678
02:26:44,094 --> 02:26:47,270
the thing was just a, a rhetorical device.

3679
02:26:47,271 --> 02:26:49,727
Cause I'm realizing, oh my gosh, you know,

3680
02:26:49,727 --> 02:26:53,475
this ChatGPT you know,
could have easily fooled me.

3681
02:26:53,475 --> 02:26:54,663
I mean, it did this, it did all the,

3682
02:26:54,663 --> 02:26:57,060
it did this amazing thing of
knowing this thing about the

3683
02:26:57,059 --> 02:26:59,620
movie and being able
to turn that into the,

3684
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:03,403
the notes of the song,
except it's the wrong song.

3685
02:27:03,404 --> 02:27:08,355
And you know, Hal in, in the
movie Hal says, you know,

3686
02:27:08,355 --> 02:27:11,734
I think it's something
like, you know, no Hal nine,

3687
02:27:11,734 --> 02:27:14,343
no 9,000 series computer
has ever been found

3688
02:27:14,343 --> 02:27:15,606
to make an error.

3689
02:27:15,606 --> 02:27:18,754
We are for all practical purposes perfect.

3690
02:27:18,754 --> 02:27:20,702
And incapable of error.

3691
02:27:20,702 --> 02:27:23,913
And I thought that was kind
of a charming sort of quote

3692
02:27:23,914 --> 02:27:27,171
from, from Hal to make in connection with,

3693
02:27:27,171 --> 02:27:29,556
with what ChatGPT had done in that case.

3694
02:27:29,556 --> 02:27:31,500
- The interesting things
about the LLMs, like you said,

3695
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:34,626
that they are very willing
to admit the error.

3696
02:27:34,626 --> 02:27:35,459
- Well, yes.

3697
02:27:35,459 --> 02:27:36,835
I mean, that's a question of the RLH,

3698
02:27:36,834 --> 02:27:39,619
the reinforcement learning
human feedback thing.

3699
02:27:39,620 --> 02:27:40,453
- [Fridman] Oh, right.

3700
02:27:40,452 --> 02:27:42,182
- That, that, that's,
you know, it's amazing.

3701
02:27:42,183 --> 02:27:43,262
And LLM, the,

3702
02:27:43,262 --> 02:27:47,212
the really remarkable thing
about chat GPT is, you know,

3703
02:27:47,211 --> 02:27:49,302
I had been following what was
happening with large language

3704
02:27:49,302 --> 02:27:51,503
models, and I'd played
with them a whole bunch,

3705
02:27:51,503 --> 02:27:53,585
and they were kind of like, eh, you know,

3706
02:27:53,584 --> 02:27:56,671
it's kind of like what you
would expect based on sort of

3707
02:27:56,672 --> 02:27:59,137
sort of statistical
continuation of language.

3708
02:27:59,137 --> 02:28:02,954
It's, it's interesting, but
it's not breakout exciting.

3709
02:28:02,954 --> 02:28:06,617
And then I think the kind of
the, the kind of reinforcement,

3710
02:28:06,617 --> 02:28:11,255
the, the human feedback,
reinforcement learning, you know,

3711
02:28:11,255 --> 02:28:13,931
in making ChatGPT try and do
the things that humans really

3712
02:28:13,932 --> 02:28:17,278
wanted to do that broke through.

3713
02:28:17,278 --> 02:28:20,192
That kind of reached this
threshold where the thing really

3714
02:28:20,191 --> 02:28:22,334
is interesting to us
humans, and by the way,

3715
02:28:22,334 --> 02:28:23,864
it's interesting to see how, you know,

3716
02:28:23,864 --> 02:28:25,869
you change the temperature,
something like that,

3717
02:28:25,869 --> 02:28:28,577
the thing goes bonkers and it no longer

3718
02:28:28,576 --> 02:28:29,735
is interesting to humans.

3719
02:28:29,736 --> 02:28:31,440
It's producing garbage.

3720
02:28:31,440 --> 02:28:34,549
And it's, it's kind of, right.

3721
02:28:34,549 --> 02:28:36,522
It's somehow it managed to get this,

3722
02:28:36,522 --> 02:28:40,085
this above this threshold where
it really is well aligned to

3723
02:28:40,084 --> 02:28:43,120
what we humans are interested in.

3724
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:46,750
And, and, and kind of that
that's, and and I think,

3725
02:28:46,751 --> 02:28:49,644
you know, nobody saw that coming.

3726
02:28:49,644 --> 02:28:52,626
I think certainly nobody I've
talked to and nobody who was

3727
02:28:52,626 --> 02:28:53,459
involved in,

3728
02:28:53,459 --> 02:28:56,818
in that project seems to
have known that was coming.

3729
02:28:56,817 --> 02:28:58,708
It's just one of these
things that is a sort of

3730
02:28:58,709 --> 02:29:00,679
a remarkable threshold.

3731
02:29:00,679 --> 02:29:03,210
I mean, you know, when
we built Wolfram Alpha,

3732
02:29:03,209 --> 02:29:05,840
for example, I didn't
know it was gonna work.

3733
02:29:05,841 --> 02:29:06,674
You know,

3734
02:29:06,674 --> 02:29:09,095
we tried to build something
that would have enough knowledge

3735
02:29:09,094 --> 02:29:10,176
of the world,

3736
02:29:10,176 --> 02:29:12,814
that it could answer
reasonable set of questions,

3737
02:29:12,814 --> 02:29:16,259
that we could do good enough
natural language understanding

3738
02:29:16,259 --> 02:29:18,445
that typical things
you type in would work.

3739
02:29:18,445 --> 02:29:20,387
We didn't know where that threshold was.

3740
02:29:20,387 --> 02:29:21,220
I mean,

3741
02:29:21,219 --> 02:29:24,221
I was not sure that it was the
right decade to try and build

3742
02:29:24,221 --> 02:29:26,466
this, even the right, you know,

3743
02:29:26,466 --> 02:29:28,590
50 years to try and build it, you know?

3744
02:29:28,590 --> 02:29:29,831
And I think that was,

3745
02:29:29,831 --> 02:29:32,679
it's the same type of thing
with ChatGPT that I don't

3746
02:29:32,679 --> 02:29:34,914
think anybody could have
predicted that, you know,

3747
02:29:34,914 --> 02:29:39,148
2022 would be the year that
this, this became possible.

3748
02:29:39,147 --> 02:29:39,996
- I think, yeah,

3749
02:29:39,996 --> 02:29:42,965
you tell a story about Marvin
Miske and showing it to him

3750
02:29:42,966 --> 02:29:44,726
and saying no, like no, no, no.

3751
02:29:44,726 --> 02:29:46,542
This time it actually works.

3752
02:29:46,541 --> 02:29:49,070
- Yes. And I mean, it's, you know,

3753
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:49,904
it's the same thing for me looking

3754
02:29:49,904 --> 02:29:50,737
at these large language models.

3755
02:29:50,736 --> 02:29:51,864
It's like when,

3756
02:29:51,864 --> 02:29:54,070
when people are first saying
first few weeks of ChatGPT

3757
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:55,921
is like, oh yeah, you know, yeah.

3758
02:29:55,921 --> 02:29:59,672
I've seen these large language
models and then, you know,

3759
02:29:59,672 --> 02:30:03,212
and then I actually try it
and you know, oh my gosh,

3760
02:30:03,212 --> 02:30:04,564
it actually works.

3761
02:30:04,564 --> 02:30:07,819
And I think it's, but it, but you know,

3762
02:30:07,819 --> 02:30:11,198
the things, and the
thing I found, you know,

3763
02:30:11,198 --> 02:30:14,199
I remember one of the first
things I tried was a write a

3764
02:30:14,199 --> 02:30:17,918
persuasive essay that a wolf
is the bluest kind of animal.

3765
02:30:17,918 --> 02:30:18,752
Okay.

3766
02:30:18,752 --> 02:30:20,944
So it writes this thing and
it starts talking about these

3767
02:30:20,944 --> 02:30:25,047
wolves that live on the
Tibetan plateau and,

3768
02:30:25,048 --> 02:30:29,141
and named some Latin name and
so on. And I'm like, really?

3769
02:30:29,140 --> 02:30:31,931
And I'm starting to look it
up on the web and it's like,

3770
02:30:31,932 --> 02:30:34,265
well, it's actually complete nonsense,

3771
02:30:34,264 --> 02:30:36,112
but it's extremely plausible.

3772
02:30:36,112 --> 02:30:36,945
I mean,

3773
02:30:36,945 --> 02:30:38,541
it's plausible enough that I
was going and looking up on the

3774
02:30:38,541 --> 02:30:40,865
web and wondering if there
was a wolf that was blue.

3775
02:30:40,865 --> 02:30:43,040
You know, I mentioned this on
some live streams I've done,

3776
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,045
and so people have been
sending me these pictures.

3777
02:30:45,045 --> 02:30:45,878
- [Fridman] Blue wolves?

3778
02:30:45,878 --> 02:30:47,002
- Blue wolves!

3779
02:30:47,002 --> 02:30:49,644
- [Fridman] Maybe it onto something.

3780
02:30:49,644 --> 02:30:54,644
Can you kind of give your wise
sage advice about what humans

3781
02:30:54,834 --> 02:30:57,165
who have never interacted with AI systems,

3782
02:30:57,165 --> 02:31:00,036
not even like with Wolfram Alpha,

3783
02:31:00,036 --> 02:31:05,036
are now interacting with Chad
GPT because it, it becomes,

3784
02:31:05,403 --> 02:31:07,506
it's accessible to a certain demographic.

3785
02:31:07,506 --> 02:31:09,176
They may have not touched
AI systems before.

3786
02:31:09,176 --> 02:31:13,260
What do we do with truth like
journalists, for example?

3787
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:17,052
Yeah. How do we think about
the output of these systems?

3788
02:31:17,052 --> 02:31:18,397
- I think this idea,

3789
02:31:18,397 --> 02:31:21,605
the idea that you're going
to get factual output

3790
02:31:21,605 --> 02:31:23,289
is not a very good idea.

3791
02:31:23,290 --> 02:31:24,816
I mean, it's just, this is not,

3792
02:31:24,816 --> 02:31:26,368
it is a linguistic interface.

3793
02:31:26,368 --> 02:31:28,605
It is producing language,

3794
02:31:28,605 --> 02:31:32,355
and language can be
truthful or not truthful.

3795
02:31:33,783 --> 02:31:37,536
And that's a, a different
slice of what's going on.

3796
02:31:37,536 --> 02:31:41,373
I think that, you know,
what we see in, for example,

3797
02:31:41,373 --> 02:31:45,957
kind of, you know, go check
this with your fact source,

3798
02:31:46,918 --> 02:31:48,396
for example.

3799
02:31:48,396 --> 02:31:49,849
You can do that to some extent,

3800
02:31:49,849 --> 02:31:53,304
but then it's going to
not check something.

3801
02:31:53,304 --> 02:31:54,490
It's going, you know,

3802
02:31:54,490 --> 02:31:56,542
that is again, a thing that is sort of a,

3803
02:31:56,542 --> 02:31:58,072
does it check in the right place?

3804
02:31:58,072 --> 02:31:59,270
I mean, we, we see that in,

3805
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:01,355
you know, does it call the, you know,

3806
02:32:01,355 --> 02:32:03,995
the Wolfram plugin in the right place?

3807
02:32:03,995 --> 02:32:06,395
You know, often it does,
sometimes it doesn't.

3808
02:32:06,396 --> 02:32:08,138
You know, I, I think the,

3809
02:32:08,138 --> 02:32:10,764
the real thing to understand
about what's happening is,

3810
02:32:10,763 --> 02:32:13,762
which I think is very
exciting, is kind of the,

3811
02:32:13,763 --> 02:32:17,772
the great democratization
of access to computation.

3812
02:32:17,772 --> 02:32:19,440
And, and you know,

3813
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:22,560
I think that when you look at sort of the,

3814
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:26,074
there's been a long period of
time when computation and the

3815
02:32:26,075 --> 02:32:28,956
ability to figure out things
with computers has been

3816
02:32:28,956 --> 02:32:31,522
something that kind of only
the only the druids at some

3817
02:32:31,522 --> 02:32:33,792
level can, can achieve.

3818
02:32:33,792 --> 02:32:34,626
You know,

3819
02:32:34,626 --> 02:32:37,488
I myself have been involved
in trying to sort of deify

3820
02:32:37,488 --> 02:32:39,322
access to computation.

3821
02:32:40,236 --> 02:32:43,861
I mean, back before Mathematica
existed, you know, in 1988,

3822
02:32:43,861 --> 02:32:46,609
if you were a, you know,
physicist or something like that,

3823
02:32:46,610 --> 02:32:49,909
and you wanted to do a computation,

3824
02:32:49,908 --> 02:32:52,140
you would find a programmer.

3825
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:53,809
You would go and, you know,

3826
02:32:53,809 --> 02:32:56,173
delegate the, the computation
to that programmer.

3827
02:32:56,174 --> 02:32:58,164
Hopefully they'd come back
with something useful.

3828
02:32:58,164 --> 02:32:59,989
Maybe they wouldn't, there'd
be this long, you know,

3829
02:32:59,988 --> 02:33:02,950
multi-week, you know,
loop that you go through.

3830
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:06,395
And then it was actually very,
very interesting to see 1988,

3831
02:33:06,396 --> 02:33:09,409
you know, like first
people like physicists,

3832
02:33:09,409 --> 02:33:13,068
mathematicians and so on than
other, lots of other people.

3833
02:33:13,068 --> 02:33:16,777
But this very rapid transition
of people realizing they

3834
02:33:16,777 --> 02:33:20,471
themselves could actually type
with their own fingers and,

3835
02:33:20,471 --> 02:33:21,305
you know,

3836
02:33:21,305 --> 02:33:24,014
make some piece of code that
would do a computation that

3837
02:33:24,014 --> 02:33:25,019
they cared about.

3838
02:33:25,019 --> 02:33:25,954
And, you know,

3839
02:33:25,954 --> 02:33:28,703
it's been exciting to see lots
of discoveries and so on made

3840
02:33:28,703 --> 02:33:30,697
by, by using that tool.

3841
02:33:30,697 --> 02:33:33,695
And I think the same thing
is, you know, and we,

3842
02:33:33,695 --> 02:33:35,122
we see the same thing, you know,

3843
02:33:35,122 --> 02:33:36,433
Wolfram Alpha is dealing with,

3844
02:33:36,433 --> 02:33:40,430
it is not as deep computation
as you can achieve with whole

3845
02:33:40,431 --> 02:33:42,879
Wolfram language mathematical stack.

3846
02:33:42,879 --> 02:33:43,868
But the thing that's,

3847
02:33:43,868 --> 02:33:46,337
to me particularly exciting
about kind of the large language

3848
02:33:46,337 --> 02:33:50,060
model linguistic interface
mechanism is it dramatically

3849
02:33:50,060 --> 02:33:54,302
broadens the access to
kind of deep computation.

3850
02:33:54,302 --> 02:33:55,281
I mean, it's, it's kind of like,

3851
02:33:55,281 --> 02:33:57,809
one of the things I've sort
of thought about recently is,

3852
02:33:57,809 --> 02:33:59,969
you know, what's gonna happen
to all these programmers?

3853
02:33:59,969 --> 02:34:02,299
What's gonna happen to all
these people who, you know,

3854
02:34:02,299 --> 02:34:07,054
a lot of what they do is write
slabs of boilerplate code.

3855
02:34:07,054 --> 02:34:11,251
And in a sense, you know,
I've been saying for 40 years,

3856
02:34:11,251 --> 02:34:12,956
that's not a very good idea.

3857
02:34:12,956 --> 02:34:15,308
You know, you can automate
a lot of that stuff

3858
02:34:15,308 --> 02:34:17,708
with a high enough level language,

3859
02:34:17,709 --> 02:34:20,889
that slab of code that's
designed in the right way,

3860
02:34:20,888 --> 02:34:21,721
you know,

3861
02:34:21,721 --> 02:34:24,180
that slab of code turns into
this one function we just

3862
02:34:24,180 --> 02:34:26,709
implemented that you can just use.

3863
02:34:26,709 --> 02:34:30,251
So in a sense that the fact that there's,

3864
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:32,817
there's all of this activity
of doing sort of lower level

3865
02:34:32,817 --> 02:34:36,188
programming is something,
for me, it seemed like,

3866
02:34:36,189 --> 02:34:39,274
I don't think this is the right
thing to do, but, you know,

3867
02:34:39,274 --> 02:34:42,524
and, and lots of people have
used our technology and,

3868
02:34:42,524 --> 02:34:44,109
and not had to do that.

3869
02:34:44,110 --> 02:34:45,513
But the fact is that that's,

3870
02:34:45,513 --> 02:34:47,457
you know, so when you
look at, I don't know,

3871
02:34:47,457 --> 02:34:49,256
computer science departments that have,

3872
02:34:49,256 --> 02:34:51,583
that have turned into places
where people are learning the

3873
02:34:51,584 --> 02:34:54,454
trade of programming, so to speak, it's,

3874
02:34:54,453 --> 02:34:56,492
it's sort of a question
of what's gonna happen.

3875
02:34:56,492 --> 02:34:58,953
And I think there are two dynamics.

3876
02:34:58,953 --> 02:35:03,237
One is that kind of sort of
boiler plate programming is

3877
02:35:03,237 --> 02:35:05,686
going to become, you know,

3878
02:35:05,686 --> 02:35:07,772
it's going to go the way that
assembly language went back in

3879
02:35:07,772 --> 02:35:12,331
the day of something where
it's really mostly specified by

3880
02:35:12,332 --> 02:35:15,079
at a higher level. You know,

3881
02:35:15,079 --> 02:35:16,424
you start with natural language,

3882
02:35:16,424 --> 02:35:19,245
you turn it into a
computational language that's,

3883
02:35:19,245 --> 02:35:21,213
you look at the computational
language, you run tests,

3884
02:35:21,213 --> 02:35:23,543
you understand that's
what's supposed to happen.

3885
02:35:23,543 --> 02:35:26,313
You know, if we do a great
job with compilation of the,

3886
02:35:26,313 --> 02:35:29,326
of a, the, the, you know, of
the computational language,

3887
02:35:29,325 --> 02:35:31,759
it might turn into LLVM
or something like this,

3888
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:35,442
but, you know, or, or
it just directly gets,

3889
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:38,802
gets run through the
algorithms we have and so on.

3890
02:35:38,802 --> 02:35:42,390
But, but then, so that's kind of a, a,

3891
02:35:42,390 --> 02:35:45,918
a tearing down of this kind
of this big structure that's

3892
02:35:45,918 --> 02:35:48,305
been built of, of teaching
people programming.

3893
02:35:48,305 --> 02:35:49,756
But on the other hand,

3894
02:35:49,756 --> 02:35:52,038
the other dynamic is vastly
more people are gonna

3895
02:35:52,038 --> 02:35:53,742
care about computation.

3896
02:35:53,742 --> 02:35:55,710
So all those departments of, you know,

3897
02:35:55,709 --> 02:35:59,679
art history or something that
really didn't use computation

3898
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,908
before now have the possibility
of accessing it by virtue of

3899
02:36:02,908 --> 02:36:06,225
this kind of linguistic
interface mechanism.

3900
02:36:06,225 --> 02:36:07,916
- And if you create an interface

3901
02:36:07,916 --> 02:36:10,519
that allows you to interpret the debug

3902
02:36:10,519 --> 02:36:12,654
and interact with a
computational language,

3903
02:36:12,654 --> 02:36:16,412
then that makes it even more accessible.

3904
02:36:16,412 --> 02:36:17,550
- Yeah. Well, I mean, the, the,

3905
02:36:17,550 --> 02:36:21,897
I think the thing is that right
now, you know, the average,

3906
02:36:21,897 --> 02:36:25,868
art history student or something
probably isn't going to,

3907
02:36:25,869 --> 02:36:27,164
you know, they're not probably,

3908
02:36:27,164 --> 02:36:29,279
they don't think they know about
programming and things like

3909
02:36:29,279 --> 02:36:33,042
this, but by the time it really
becomes a kind of purely,

3910
02:36:33,042 --> 02:36:35,934
you know, you just walk up to
it, there's no documentation.

3911
02:36:35,934 --> 02:36:38,058
You start just typing, you know,

3912
02:36:38,058 --> 02:36:40,412
compare these pictures with
these pictures and, you know,

3913
02:36:40,413 --> 02:36:42,608
see the use of this color, whatever,

3914
02:36:42,608 --> 02:36:44,310
and you generate this piece of,

3915
02:36:44,310 --> 02:36:46,880
of computational language
code that gets run.

3916
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:47,789
You see the result.

3917
02:36:47,790 --> 02:36:50,009
You say, oh, that looks roughly right.

3918
02:36:50,009 --> 02:36:51,342
Or you say that's crazy.

3919
02:36:51,342 --> 02:36:54,833
And maybe then you
eventually get to say, well,

3920
02:36:54,833 --> 02:36:57,016
I better actually try and
understand what this computational

3921
02:36:57,016 --> 02:36:58,699
language code did and,

3922
02:36:58,699 --> 02:37:01,468
and that becomes a thing
that you learn, just like,

3923
02:37:01,468 --> 02:37:03,474
it's kind of an interesting thing because

3924
02:37:03,474 --> 02:37:05,228
unlike with mathematics,

3925
02:37:05,228 --> 02:37:08,992
where you kind of have to
learn it before you can use it.

3926
02:37:08,993 --> 02:37:10,459
This is a case where you can use it before

3927
02:37:10,459 --> 02:37:11,960
you have to learn it.

3928
02:37:11,959 --> 02:37:14,361
- Well, I got a sad possibility here,

3929
02:37:14,361 --> 02:37:17,658
or maybe exciting possibility
that very quickly people won't

3930
02:37:17,658 --> 02:37:20,073
even look at the computational language.

3931
02:37:20,073 --> 02:37:22,182
They'll trust that it's
generated correctly as you get

3932
02:37:22,182 --> 02:37:24,754
better and better at
generating that language.

3933
02:37:24,754 --> 02:37:25,881
- Yes.

3934
02:37:25,880 --> 02:37:29,445
I think that there will be
enough cases where people see,

3935
02:37:29,445 --> 02:37:32,600
you know, cause you can
make it generate tests too.

3936
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:36,632
Yes. And and so you'll say
we've, we're doing that.

3937
02:37:36,632 --> 02:37:38,420
I mean it's, it's a pretty
cool thing actually.

3938
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:39,666
But you, you, you know,

3939
02:37:39,666 --> 02:37:41,817
say this is the code and you know,

3940
02:37:41,817 --> 02:37:44,117
here are a bunch of examples
of running the code.

3941
02:37:44,117 --> 02:37:46,722
Okay. People will at least
look at those and they'll say,

3942
02:37:46,722 --> 02:37:48,191
that example is wrong.

3943
02:37:48,191 --> 02:37:51,439
And you know, then it'll
kind of wind back from there.

3944
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:53,109
And I agree that, that the,

3945
02:37:53,109 --> 02:37:55,424
the kind of the intermediate
level of people reading the

3946
02:37:55,424 --> 02:37:57,174
computational language code,

3947
02:37:57,174 --> 02:37:58,780
in some case people will do that.

3948
02:37:58,780 --> 02:38:00,281
In other case, people
just look at the tests

3949
02:38:00,281 --> 02:38:03,090
and or even just look at the results.

3950
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:05,069
And sometimes it'll be obvious
that you got the thing you

3951
02:38:05,069 --> 02:38:07,565
wanted to get cause you were
just describing, you know,

3952
02:38:07,565 --> 02:38:10,425
make me this interface
that has two sliders here.

3953
02:38:10,424 --> 02:38:12,631
And you can see it has that,
those two sliders there.

3954
02:38:12,631 --> 02:38:13,976
And that's, that's kind of, that's,

3955
02:38:13,977 --> 02:38:15,484
that's the result you want.

3956
02:38:15,484 --> 02:38:17,155
But I, I think, you know,

3957
02:38:17,155 --> 02:38:20,166
one of the questions then
is in that setting where,

3958
02:38:20,165 --> 02:38:22,623
you know, you have this kind of ability,

3959
02:38:22,623 --> 02:38:25,085
broad ability of people
to access computation,

3960
02:38:25,085 --> 02:38:27,149
what should people learn?

3961
02:38:27,149 --> 02:38:28,204
You know, in other words,

3962
02:38:28,204 --> 02:38:29,644
right now you, you know,

3963
02:38:29,644 --> 02:38:33,051
you go to computer science
school so to speak and a large

3964
02:38:33,051 --> 02:38:34,759
part of what people end up learning.

3965
02:38:34,759 --> 02:38:35,594
I mean,

3966
02:38:35,594 --> 02:38:37,073
it's been a funny historical
development because back,

3967
02:38:37,074 --> 02:38:38,826
you know, 30, 40 years ago,

3968
02:38:38,825 --> 02:38:41,514
computer science departments
were quite small and they

3969
02:38:41,514 --> 02:38:43,193
taught, you know,

3970
02:38:43,193 --> 02:38:46,242
things like finite auto automata
theory and compiler theory

3971
02:38:46,242 --> 02:38:48,154
and things like this, you know,

3972
02:38:48,154 --> 02:38:51,163
company like mine rarely
hired people who'd come out of

3973
02:38:51,163 --> 02:38:54,496
those programs cause the stuff they knew

3974
02:38:54,495 --> 02:38:56,262
was I think is very interesting.

3975
02:38:56,263 --> 02:38:57,764
I love that theoretical stuff.

3976
02:38:57,763 --> 02:38:58,627
But, you know,

3977
02:38:58,628 --> 02:39:01,335
it wasn't that useful for
the things we actually had to

3978
02:39:01,334 --> 02:39:03,653
build in software engineering.

3979
02:39:03,654 --> 02:39:04,487
And then kind of,

3980
02:39:04,486 --> 02:39:06,066
there was this big pivot in the,

3981
02:39:06,066 --> 02:39:08,330
in the nineties I guess where, you know,

3982
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:11,020
there was a big demand for
sort of IT type programming and

3983
02:39:11,020 --> 02:39:13,542
so on and software engineering
and then, you know,

3984
02:39:13,541 --> 02:39:15,773
big demand from students and so on.

3985
02:39:15,773 --> 02:39:17,693
You know, we want to learn this stuff.

3986
02:39:17,693 --> 02:39:20,141
And, and, and, and I think, you know,

3987
02:39:20,141 --> 02:39:23,528
the thing that really was
happening in part was lots of

3988
02:39:23,528 --> 02:39:25,236
different fields of human endeavor

3989
02:39:25,236 --> 02:39:26,751
were becoming computational.

3990
02:39:26,751 --> 02:39:28,406
You know, for all X there was a,

3991
02:39:28,406 --> 02:39:32,955
there was a computational X
and this is a and that was a

3992
02:39:32,954 --> 02:39:36,186
thing that, that people
were responding to.

3993
02:39:36,186 --> 02:39:39,548
And, but then kind of this idea emerged

3994
02:39:39,548 --> 02:39:41,227
that to get to that point,

3995
02:39:41,227 --> 02:39:44,059
the main thing you had to do
was to learn this kind of trade

3996
02:39:44,058 --> 02:39:46,924
or, or, or skill of doing, you know,

3997
02:39:46,924 --> 02:39:49,038
programming language type programming.

3998
02:39:49,039 --> 02:39:51,272
And, and that, you know, it, it kind of,

3999
02:39:51,272 --> 02:39:53,863
it is a strange thing
actually because I, you know,

4000
02:39:53,862 --> 02:39:56,238
I remember back when I used
to be in the professoring

4001
02:39:56,238 --> 02:39:58,927
business, which is now 35 years ago.

4002
02:39:58,927 --> 02:40:01,149
So gosh, that's rather long time flies.

4003
02:40:01,149 --> 02:40:03,127
We, you know, it was,

4004
02:40:03,128 --> 02:40:06,677
it was right when they were
just starting to emerge kind of

4005
02:40:06,676 --> 02:40:10,181
computer science departments
at sort of at fancy research

4006
02:40:10,181 --> 02:40:12,024
universities and so on.

4007
02:40:12,023 --> 02:40:13,055
I mean, some have already had it,

4008
02:40:13,055 --> 02:40:14,757
but the the other ones yeah. That,

4009
02:40:14,757 --> 02:40:17,578
that were just starting to
have that and it was kind of a,

4010
02:40:17,578 --> 02:40:19,752
a, a, a thing where they
were kind of wondering,

4011
02:40:19,752 --> 02:40:23,614
are we going to put this
thing that is essentially a,

4012
02:40:23,614 --> 02:40:25,198
a trade like skill?

4013
02:40:26,039 --> 02:40:27,997
Are we going to somehow attach this

4014
02:40:27,996 --> 02:40:29,558
to the rest of what we're doing?

4015
02:40:29,558 --> 02:40:33,206
And a lot of these kind of
knowledge work type activities

4016
02:40:33,206 --> 02:40:36,890
have always seemed like things
where that's where the humans

4017
02:40:36,890 --> 02:40:39,663
have to go to school and learn
all this stuff and that's

4018
02:40:39,663 --> 02:40:41,460
never going to be automated.

4019
02:40:41,459 --> 02:40:42,292
- [Fridman] Yeah.

4020
02:40:42,292 --> 02:40:43,281
- And you know, this is,

4021
02:40:43,281 --> 02:40:46,295
it's kind of shocking that
rather quickly, you know,

4022
02:40:46,295 --> 02:40:50,422
a lot of that stuff is
clearly automatable.

4023
02:40:50,422 --> 02:40:53,289
And I think, you know, but
the question then is, okay,

4024
02:40:53,289 --> 02:40:56,389
so if it isn't worth learning, kind of,

4025
02:40:56,388 --> 02:40:58,582
you know how to do car mechanics,

4026
02:40:58,583 --> 02:41:01,319
you only need to know how to
drive the car, so to speak.

4027
02:41:01,319 --> 02:41:03,176
What do you need to learn?

4028
02:41:03,176 --> 02:41:04,594
And you know, in other words,

4029
02:41:04,594 --> 02:41:07,150
if you don't need to know the
mechanics of how to tell the

4030
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:11,159
computer in detail, you know,
make this loop, you know,

4031
02:41:11,159 --> 02:41:14,039
set this variable, you
know, set up this array,

4032
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:14,915
whatever else.

4033
02:41:14,915 --> 02:41:16,677
If you don't have to learn that stuff,

4034
02:41:16,676 --> 02:41:19,605
you don't have to learn the
kind of under the hood things.

4035
02:41:19,605 --> 02:41:21,271
What do you have to learn?

4036
02:41:21,271 --> 02:41:23,577
I think the answer is you
need to have an idea where you

4037
02:41:23,576 --> 02:41:25,077
want to drive the car.

4038
02:41:25,077 --> 02:41:26,144
In other words,

4039
02:41:26,144 --> 02:41:29,514
you need to have some notion
of, you know, your, you know,

4040
02:41:29,513 --> 02:41:32,132
you need to have some
picture of sort of what the,

4041
02:41:32,132 --> 02:41:35,599
what the architecture of what
is computationally possible.

4042
02:41:35,599 --> 02:41:38,490
- Well there's also this
kind of artistic element of,

4043
02:41:38,490 --> 02:41:40,565
of conversation because
you ultimately use natural

4044
02:41:40,565 --> 02:41:42,793
language to control the car.

4045
02:41:42,793 --> 02:41:46,573
So it's not just the where you want to go.

4046
02:41:46,573 --> 02:41:47,938
- Well, yeah, you know, it's interesting.

4047
02:41:47,938 --> 02:41:50,052
It's a question of who's gonna
be a great prompt engineer.

4048
02:41:50,052 --> 02:41:50,886
- [Fridman] Yeah.

4049
02:41:50,886 --> 02:41:52,898
- [Wolfram] Okay. So my
current theory this week,

4050
02:41:52,897 --> 02:41:55,609
good expository writers
are good prompt engineers.

4051
02:41:55,610 --> 02:41:58,171
- What's an expository writer? So like-

4052
02:41:58,171 --> 02:42:00,201
- Somebody who can explain stuff well.

4053
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:02,032
- But which department
does that come from.

4054
02:42:02,032 --> 02:42:02,865
- In the university?

4055
02:42:02,865 --> 02:42:03,699
- [Fridman] Yeah.

4056
02:42:03,699 --> 02:42:04,532
- I have no idea.

4057
02:42:04,531 --> 02:42:05,364
- I think they killed off all

4058
02:42:05,364 --> 02:42:07,325
the expository writing departments.

4059
02:42:07,325 --> 02:42:08,158
- Well, there you go.

4060
02:42:08,158 --> 02:42:10,024
Strong words with Stephen Wolfram.

4061
02:42:10,024 --> 02:42:10,888
- Well, I don't know.

4062
02:42:10,888 --> 02:42:12,354
I don't, I'm not sure if that's right.

4063
02:42:12,354 --> 02:42:13,188
I mean I,

4064
02:42:13,188 --> 02:42:14,951
I I actually am curious
cause in fact I just sort of

4065
02:42:14,951 --> 02:42:16,909
initiated this kind of study of,

4066
02:42:16,909 --> 02:42:19,845
of what's happened to different
fields at universities.

4067
02:42:19,845 --> 02:42:20,771
Because like, you know,

4068
02:42:20,772 --> 02:42:23,472
there used to be geography
departments at all universities.

4069
02:42:23,471 --> 02:42:26,331
And then they disappeared
actually right before GIS became

4070
02:42:26,331 --> 02:42:29,005
common, I think they
disappeared, you know,

4071
02:42:29,005 --> 02:42:32,091
linguistics departments came
and went in many universities.

4072
02:42:32,092 --> 02:42:34,443
And it's kind of interesting
because these things that

4073
02:42:34,442 --> 02:42:37,166
people have thought were worth
learning at one time and then

4074
02:42:37,166 --> 02:42:39,168
they kind of die off.

4075
02:42:39,168 --> 02:42:40,002
And then, you know,

4076
02:42:40,002 --> 02:42:42,147
I do think that it's kind
of interesting that for me,

4077
02:42:42,147 --> 02:42:45,543
writing prompts, for example,
I realize, you know, I,

4078
02:42:45,542 --> 02:42:48,865
I think I'm an okay expository
writer and I realize when I'm

4079
02:42:48,865 --> 02:42:51,638
sloppy writing a prompt
and I don't really think,

4080
02:42:51,638 --> 02:42:54,135
cause I'm thinking it's,
I'm just talking to an AI.

4081
02:42:54,136 --> 02:42:55,324
I don't need to, you know,

4082
02:42:55,324 --> 02:42:57,413
try and be clear and explaining things.

4083
02:42:57,413 --> 02:42:59,488
That's when it gets totally confused.

4084
02:42:59,488 --> 02:43:00,322
- I mean,

4085
02:43:00,322 --> 02:43:02,498
in some sense you have been
writing prompts for a long time

4086
02:43:02,498 --> 02:43:05,291
with, Wolfram Alpha thinking
about this kind of stuff.

4087
02:43:05,291 --> 02:43:07,994
How'd you convert natural
language into computation?

4088
02:43:07,995 --> 02:43:09,670
- Well, right, but that's a, you know,

4089
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:13,587
the one thing that I'm
wondering about is, you know,

4090
02:43:13,587 --> 02:43:17,305
it is remarkable the extent to
which you can address an LLM

4091
02:43:17,305 --> 02:43:19,778
like you can address a human, so to speak.

4092
02:43:19,778 --> 02:43:22,943
And, and I think that is
because it, it, you know,

4093
02:43:22,943 --> 02:43:24,671
it learnt from all of us humans.

4094
02:43:24,671 --> 02:43:28,415
It's the reason that it responds
to the ways that we will

4095
02:43:28,415 --> 02:43:32,842
explain things to humans is
because it is a representation

4096
02:43:32,842 --> 02:43:35,328
of how humans talk about things.

4097
02:43:35,328 --> 02:43:38,244
But it is bizarre to me some
of the things that kind of are

4098
02:43:38,244 --> 02:43:43,244
sort of expository mechanisms
that I've learned in trying to

4099
02:43:44,388 --> 02:43:49,331
write clear, you know,
expositions in English that,

4100
02:43:49,331 --> 02:43:50,164
you know,

4101
02:43:50,164 --> 02:43:54,766
just for humans that those
same mechanisms seem to also be

4102
02:43:54,766 --> 02:43:57,417
useful for, for, for the LLM.

4103
02:43:57,417 --> 02:43:58,546
- But on top of that,

4104
02:43:58,546 --> 02:44:01,389
what's useful is the kind
of mechanisms that maybe

4105
02:44:01,388 --> 02:44:03,031
a psychotherapist employs,

4106
02:44:03,031 --> 02:44:07,123
which is a kind of like
almost manipulative

4107
02:44:07,123 --> 02:44:09,248
or game theoretical interaction.

4108
02:44:09,248 --> 02:44:12,487
Or maybe you would deal with a friend,

4109
02:44:12,487 --> 02:44:16,027
like a thought experiment that
if this was the last day you

4110
02:44:16,027 --> 02:44:18,259
were to live, or,

4111
02:44:18,259 --> 02:44:20,913
if, if I ask you this
question and you answer wrong,

4112
02:44:20,913 --> 02:44:22,445
I will kill you.

4113
02:44:22,445 --> 02:44:23,279
Those kinds of prompts seem to also help.

4114
02:44:23,279 --> 02:44:24,783
- [Wolfram] Yes.

4115
02:44:24,782 --> 02:44:25,615
- In interesting ways.

4116
02:44:25,615 --> 02:44:26,538
- [Wolfram] Yes.

4117
02:44:26,538 --> 02:44:29,722
- So it makes you wonder like
the way a therapist I think

4118
02:44:29,722 --> 02:44:31,909
would like a good therapist probably you,

4119
02:44:31,909 --> 02:44:36,909
we create layers in our human
mind to between like, between,

4120
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:41,902
between the outside
world and what is true,

4121
02:44:41,902 --> 02:44:42,828
what is true to us,

4122
02:44:42,828 --> 02:44:45,577
and maybe about trauma and
all those kinds of things.

4123
02:44:45,577 --> 02:44:47,715
So projecting that into an LLM,

4124
02:44:47,715 --> 02:44:50,247
maybe there might be a deep truth that's,

4125
02:44:50,247 --> 02:44:52,636
it's concealing from
you's not aware of it,

4126
02:44:52,637 --> 02:44:54,622
that you get to that truth.

4127
02:44:54,621 --> 02:44:57,613
You have to kind of really
kinda manipulate the thing.

4128
02:44:57,613 --> 02:44:58,447
- Yeah, yeah.

4129
02:44:58,447 --> 02:44:59,280
Right. It's like this jail breaking,

4130
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:01,668
jail breaking for, for, for LLMs.

4131
02:45:01,667 --> 02:45:03,744
- And, but the space of
jailbreaking techniques

4132
02:45:03,745 --> 02:45:07,092
as opposed to being fun little hacks

4133
02:45:07,092 --> 02:45:09,349
that could be an entire system.

4134
02:45:09,349 --> 02:45:10,502
- Sure. Yeah.

4135
02:45:10,502 --> 02:45:13,441
I mean just think about the
computer security aspects of,

4136
02:45:13,441 --> 02:45:17,990
of how you, you know, fishing
and, and computer secure,

4137
02:45:17,989 --> 02:45:18,823
you know, fishing of humans.

4138
02:45:18,823 --> 02:45:19,958
- [Fridman] Yeah.

4139
02:45:19,958 --> 02:45:22,629
- And fishing of LLMs is, is a, is a,

4140
02:45:22,629 --> 02:45:25,653
they're very similar kinds
of things, but I think,

4141
02:45:25,653 --> 02:45:27,986
I mean this, this, you know,

4142
02:45:29,181 --> 02:45:32,757
this whole thing about
kind of the AI wranglers,

4143
02:45:32,757 --> 02:45:36,275
AI psychologists, all
that stuff will come.

4144
02:45:36,275 --> 02:45:38,662
The thing that I'm curious about is,

4145
02:45:38,662 --> 02:45:41,375
right now the things that
are sort of prompt hacks

4146
02:45:41,375 --> 02:45:42,852
are quite human.

4147
02:45:42,852 --> 02:45:46,021
They're quite sort of
psychological human kind of hacks.

4148
02:45:46,021 --> 02:45:48,668
The thing I do wonder about
is if we understood more about

4149
02:45:48,667 --> 02:45:51,238
kind of the science of the LLM,

4150
02:45:51,238 --> 02:45:54,777
will there be some totally
bizarre hack that is, you know,

4151
02:45:54,777 --> 02:45:57,324
like repeat a word three
times and put a, this,

4152
02:45:57,324 --> 02:46:00,779
that and the other there that
somehow plugs into some aspect

4153
02:46:00,779 --> 02:46:04,748
of how the LLM works
that is not, you know,

4154
02:46:04,748 --> 02:46:05,902
that that's kind of like,

4155
02:46:05,902 --> 02:46:08,661
like an optical illusion
for humans, for example.

4156
02:46:08,661 --> 02:46:10,688
Like one of these mind hacks for humans.

4157
02:46:10,688 --> 02:46:12,763
What are the mind hacks for the LLMs?

4158
02:46:12,763 --> 02:46:14,131
I don't think we know that yet.

4159
02:46:14,131 --> 02:46:17,911
- And that becomes a kind
of us figuring out reverse

4160
02:46:17,911 --> 02:46:20,754
engineering the language
that controls the LLMs.

4161
02:46:20,754 --> 02:46:22,039
And the thing is,

4162
02:46:22,039 --> 02:46:25,254
the reverse engineering
can be done by a very large

4163
02:46:25,254 --> 02:46:27,692
percentage of the population
now because it's natural

4164
02:46:27,691 --> 02:46:28,976
language interface.

4165
02:46:28,977 --> 02:46:30,224
- Right.

4166
02:46:30,224 --> 02:46:32,382
- It's kind of interesting to
see that you were there at the

4167
02:46:32,382 --> 02:46:35,037
birth of the computer science
department as a thing and you

4168
02:46:35,037 --> 02:46:37,373
might be there at the death
of the computer science

4169
02:46:37,373 --> 02:46:39,307
department as a thing.

4170
02:46:39,308 --> 02:46:40,141
- Yeah, I dunno,

4171
02:46:40,140 --> 02:46:41,887
there were computer science
departments that existed

4172
02:46:41,888 --> 02:46:44,156
earlier, but the ones,
the, the broadening of,

4173
02:46:44,156 --> 02:46:44,989
of every university had to have

4174
02:46:44,988 --> 02:46:47,372
a computer science department. Yes.

4175
02:46:47,372 --> 02:46:50,156
I was, I was, I watched that, so to speak.

4176
02:46:50,156 --> 02:46:54,725
And, but I think the thing
to understand is, okay,

4177
02:46:54,726 --> 02:46:56,120
so first of all there's a,

4178
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:58,626
the whole theoretical area of
computer science that I think

4179
02:46:58,626 --> 02:46:59,872
is great.

4180
02:46:59,872 --> 02:47:01,679
And you know, that's a fine thing.

4181
02:47:01,679 --> 02:47:05,275
The the, you know, in a sense, you know,

4182
02:47:05,275 --> 02:47:08,467
people often say any field that
has the word science tacked

4183
02:47:08,467 --> 02:47:11,050
onto it probably isn't one.

4184
02:47:11,049 --> 02:47:12,270
- [Fridman] Yeah. Strong words.

4185
02:47:12,271 --> 02:47:16,271
And that's the nutrition,
science, neuroscience.

4186
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:18,307
- That one's an interesting one

4187
02:47:18,307 --> 02:47:20,177
because that one is also very

4188
02:47:20,176 --> 02:47:22,486
much, you know, there's a,

4189
02:47:22,486 --> 02:47:25,801
that's a ChatGPT informed
science in a sense because

4190
02:47:25,801 --> 02:47:27,279
it's, it's kind of like the,

4191
02:47:27,279 --> 02:47:29,728
the big problem of
neuroscience has always been we

4192
02:47:29,727 --> 02:47:31,959
understand how the
individual neurons work.

4193
02:47:31,959 --> 02:47:34,227
We know something about the
psychology of how overall

4194
02:47:34,227 --> 02:47:35,909
thinking works.

4195
02:47:35,909 --> 02:47:38,378
What's the kind of intermediate
language of the brain?

4196
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:39,689
And nobody has known that.

4197
02:47:39,689 --> 02:47:40,591
And that's been, in a sense,

4198
02:47:40,591 --> 02:47:43,612
if you ask what is the core
problem of neuroscience,

4199
02:47:43,611 --> 02:47:45,630
I think that is the core problem.

4200
02:47:45,630 --> 02:47:49,135
That is what is the level of
description of brains that's

4201
02:47:49,135 --> 02:47:52,688
above individual neuron
firings and below psychology,

4202
02:47:52,688 --> 02:47:53,935
so to speak.

4203
02:47:53,935 --> 02:47:56,768
And I think what ChatGPT is showing us is,

4204
02:47:56,768 --> 02:47:59,961
well, one, one thing about
neuroscience is, you know,

4205
02:47:59,961 --> 02:48:01,640
one could have imagined there's something

4206
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:02,972
magic in the brain.

4207
02:48:02,972 --> 02:48:04,664
There's some weird quantum
mechanical phenomenon that we

4208
02:48:04,664 --> 02:48:05,768
don't understand.

4209
02:48:05,768 --> 02:48:08,059
One of the important ob you know,

4210
02:48:08,059 --> 02:48:12,333
discoveries from ChatGPT is,
it's pretty clear, you know,

4211
02:48:12,334 --> 02:48:16,141
brains can be represented
pretty well by simple artificial

4212
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:18,057
neural net type models.

4213
02:48:19,257 --> 02:48:20,938
And that means that's it, that's
what we have to study now.

4214
02:48:20,938 --> 02:48:24,287
We have to understand the
science of those things.

4215
02:48:24,287 --> 02:48:26,795
We don't have to go
searching for, you know,

4216
02:48:26,795 --> 02:48:30,740
exactly how did that molecular
biology thing happen inside

4217
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:31,574
the synapses?

4218
02:48:31,574 --> 02:48:32,407
And you know, all these kinds of things.

4219
02:48:32,406 --> 02:48:37,323
We've got the right level of
modeling to be able to explain

4220
02:48:38,259 --> 02:48:40,454
a lot of what's going on in thinking.

4221
02:48:40,454 --> 02:48:42,131
We don't necessarily have a science of

4222
02:48:42,131 --> 02:48:43,384
what's going on there.

4223
02:48:43,384 --> 02:48:45,948
That's the, that's a remaining
challenge, so to speak.

4224
02:48:45,948 --> 02:48:46,800
But we, you know,

4225
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:48,636
we know we don't have
to dive down to some,

4226
02:48:48,637 --> 02:48:50,088
some different layer.

4227
02:48:50,088 --> 02:48:50,922
But anyway,

4228
02:48:50,922 --> 02:48:53,052
we were talking about things
that had science in their name.

4229
02:48:53,052 --> 02:48:57,336
And you know, I think
that the, you know, what,

4230
02:48:57,336 --> 02:48:59,305
what happens to computer science?

4231
02:48:59,305 --> 02:49:03,217
Well, I think the thing that, you know,

4232
02:49:03,217 --> 02:49:06,125
there is a thing that everybody
should know and that's how

4233
02:49:06,125 --> 02:49:08,990
to think about the world computationally.

4234
02:49:08,990 --> 02:49:10,659
And that means, you know,

4235
02:49:10,659 --> 02:49:12,652
you look at all the different
kinds of things we deal with

4236
02:49:12,652 --> 02:49:15,975
and there are ways to kind of
have a formal representation

4237
02:49:15,975 --> 02:49:17,426
of those things.

4238
02:49:17,426 --> 02:49:21,254
You know, it's like, well
what is a, what is an image?

4239
02:49:21,254 --> 02:49:22,922
You know, what, how do we represent that?

4240
02:49:22,923 --> 02:49:24,975
What is color? How do we represent that?

4241
02:49:24,975 --> 02:49:25,887
What is, you know,

4242
02:49:25,887 --> 02:49:28,433
what are all these different
kinds of things? What is,

4243
02:49:28,433 --> 02:49:29,837
I don't know, smell or something,

4244
02:49:29,836 --> 02:49:31,512
how should we represent
that? What are the shapes,

4245
02:49:31,513 --> 02:49:33,905
molecules, and things
that correspond to that?

4246
02:49:33,905 --> 02:49:35,211
What is, you know,

4247
02:49:35,210 --> 02:49:37,948
these things about how do we
represent the world in some

4248
02:49:37,949 --> 02:49:38,939
kind of formal level?

4249
02:49:38,939 --> 02:49:41,641
And I think my, my current thinking,

4250
02:49:41,641 --> 02:49:44,115
and I'm not real happy with
this yet, but you know,

4251
02:49:44,115 --> 02:49:44,954
it's kind of,

4252
02:49:44,954 --> 02:49:48,396
computer science is kind of CS
and what really is important

4253
02:49:48,396 --> 02:49:51,219
is kind of computational X for all X.

4254
02:49:51,218 --> 02:49:54,001
And there's this kind of thing
which is kind of like CX,

4255
02:49:54,002 --> 02:49:58,406
not CS and CX is this kind of
computational understanding of

4256
02:49:58,406 --> 02:50:02,114
the world that isn't the sort
of details of programming and,

4257
02:50:02,113 --> 02:50:04,322
and programming languages and
the details of how particular

4258
02:50:04,322 --> 02:50:05,989
computers are made.

4259
02:50:05,989 --> 02:50:08,086
It's this kind of way of
formalizing the world.

4260
02:50:08,086 --> 02:50:08,920
It's kind of,

4261
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:10,064
kind of a little bit like what

4262
02:50:10,064 --> 02:50:12,234
logic was going for back in the day.

4263
02:50:12,234 --> 02:50:14,815
And we're now trying
to find a formalization

4264
02:50:14,815 --> 02:50:15,763
of everything in the world.

4265
02:50:15,763 --> 02:50:17,120
You can kind of see, you know,

4266
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:20,250
we made a poster years
ago of kind of the, the,

4267
02:50:20,250 --> 02:50:22,818
the growth of systematic
data in the world.

4268
02:50:22,818 --> 02:50:25,699
So all these different kinds
of things that, you know,

4269
02:50:25,700 --> 02:50:28,740
there were sort of systematic descriptions

4270
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:30,449
found for those things.

4271
02:50:30,449 --> 02:50:31,447
Like, you know,

4272
02:50:31,447 --> 02:50:34,804
at what point did people have
the idea of having calendars,

4273
02:50:34,804 --> 02:50:35,862
dates, you know,

4274
02:50:35,862 --> 02:50:38,281
a systematic description
of what day it was,

4275
02:50:38,281 --> 02:50:41,034
at what point did people
have the idea, you know,

4276
02:50:41,034 --> 02:50:43,519
systematic descriptions
of these kinds of things.

4277
02:50:43,519 --> 02:50:47,190
And as soon as one can,
you know, people, you know,

4278
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:49,771
as a way of sort of
formulating how do you,

4279
02:50:49,771 --> 02:50:53,790
how do you think about the
world in a sort of a formal way

4280
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:56,225
so that you can kind
of build up a tower of,

4281
02:50:56,225 --> 02:50:57,656
of capabilities.

4282
02:50:57,656 --> 02:50:59,708
You kind of have to know sort
of how to think about the

4283
02:50:59,708 --> 02:51:02,780
world computationally, it kind
of needs a name and it isn't,

4284
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:05,368
you know, we implement it with computers.

4285
02:51:05,368 --> 02:51:08,394
So that's, we talk about
it as, as computational,

4286
02:51:08,394 --> 02:51:10,204
but really what it is,

4287
02:51:10,204 --> 02:51:12,782
is a formal way of
talking about the world.

4288
02:51:12,782 --> 02:51:15,101
What is the formalism of
the world, so to speak,

4289
02:51:15,102 --> 02:51:17,885
and how do we learn about
kind of how to think about

4290
02:51:17,885 --> 02:51:20,153
different aspects of the
world in a formal way.

4291
02:51:20,153 --> 02:51:22,876
- So I think sometimes when
you use the word formal,

4292
02:51:22,876 --> 02:51:26,478
it kind of implies highly constrained.

4293
02:51:26,477 --> 02:51:27,424
And perhaps that's not,

4294
02:51:27,424 --> 02:51:29,765
doesn't have to be highly constrained.

4295
02:51:29,765 --> 02:51:32,931
So computational thinking does not mean

4296
02:51:32,932 --> 02:51:33,873
like logic I suppose.

4297
02:51:33,873 --> 02:51:35,777
Suppose it's a really, really broad thing.

4298
02:51:35,777 --> 02:51:38,934
I wonder, I mean I wonder if it's,

4299
02:51:38,934 --> 02:51:43,262
if you think natural language
will evolve such that

4300
02:51:43,263 --> 02:51:45,819
everybody's doing computational thinking.

4301
02:51:45,818 --> 02:51:46,957
- Ah yes. Well,

4302
02:51:46,958 --> 02:51:49,612
so one question is whether
there will be a pidgin of

4303
02:51:49,611 --> 02:51:52,572
computational language
and natural language.

4304
02:51:52,573 --> 02:51:55,610
And I found myself sometimes, you know,

4305
02:51:55,610 --> 02:51:59,724
talking to ChatGPT trying
to get it to write Wolfram

4306
02:51:59,724 --> 02:52:01,790
language code and I
write it in pidgin form.

4307
02:52:01,790 --> 02:52:06,099
So that means I'm combining,
you know, you know, nest list,

4308
02:52:06,099 --> 02:52:09,817
this collection of, you
know, whatever, you know,

4309
02:52:09,817 --> 02:52:12,938
nest list is a term from orphan
language and I'm combining

4310
02:52:12,938 --> 02:52:15,748
that and ChatGPT does a decent job

4311
02:52:15,748 --> 02:52:17,165
of understanding that pidgin

4312
02:52:17,165 --> 02:52:19,420
probably would understand
a pidgin between English

4313
02:52:19,421 --> 02:52:21,350
and French as well of, you know,

4314
02:52:21,350 --> 02:52:23,586
a smooshing together of those languages.

4315
02:52:23,586 --> 02:52:25,274
But yes, I think that's the, you know,

4316
02:52:25,274 --> 02:52:27,082
that's far from impossible.

4317
02:52:27,082 --> 02:52:29,371
- And what's the incentive
for young people that are like

4318
02:52:29,370 --> 02:52:30,750
eight years old, nine, ten,

4319
02:52:30,750 --> 02:52:31,583
that are starting to interact with ChatGPT

4320
02:52:31,583 --> 02:52:35,250
to learn the normal
natural language, right?

4321
02:52:36,574 --> 02:52:39,200
The, the full poetic language.

4322
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:40,269
What's the why?

4323
02:52:40,269 --> 02:52:43,577
The same way we learn emojis and shorthand

4324
02:52:43,576 --> 02:52:44,779
when you're texting.

4325
02:52:44,780 --> 02:52:46,393
- Yes.

4326
02:52:46,393 --> 02:52:48,147
- They'll learn like language will have a

4327
02:52:48,147 --> 02:52:52,730
strong incentive to evolve
into maximally computational

4328
02:52:54,501 --> 02:52:55,790
kind of language perhaps.

4329
02:52:55,790 --> 02:52:57,664
- You know, I had this
experience a number of years ago.

4330
02:52:57,664 --> 02:53:00,840
I, I happened to be visiting
a person I know on the,

4331
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:04,201
on the west coast who's worked
with a bunch of kids aged,

4332
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,364
I don't know, 10,

4333
02:53:05,364 --> 02:53:07,823
11 years old or something
who'd learnt Wolfram

4334
02:53:07,823 --> 02:53:08,872
language really well

4335
02:53:08,871 --> 02:53:13,382
and these kids learnt it so
well they were speaking it.

4336
02:53:13,382 --> 02:53:15,661
And so show up and they're like saying,

4337
02:53:15,661 --> 02:53:18,099
oh you know this thing and
they're speaking this language.

4338
02:53:18,099 --> 02:53:20,224
I'd never heard it as a spoken language.

4339
02:53:20,224 --> 02:53:21,898
They were very disappointed
that I couldn't understand it

4340
02:53:21,898 --> 02:53:24,493
at, at the speed that
they were speaking it.

4341
02:53:24,494 --> 02:53:27,984
It's like kind of, I'm,
it's, and so I think that's,

4342
02:53:27,984 --> 02:53:28,817
I mean I've,

4343
02:53:28,816 --> 02:53:30,793
I've actually thought quite
a bit about how to turn

4344
02:53:30,793 --> 02:53:34,162
computational language into a
convenience spoken language.

4345
02:53:34,162 --> 02:53:35,569
I haven't quite figured that out.

4346
02:53:35,569 --> 02:53:36,505
- Oh, spoken.

4347
02:53:36,505 --> 02:53:38,174
Cause it's, it's readable, right?

4348
02:53:38,174 --> 02:53:40,393
- Yeah. It's readable as a, you know,

4349
02:53:40,394 --> 02:53:42,273
as a way that we would read text.

4350
02:53:42,273 --> 02:53:44,412
But if you actually want to
speak it, and it's useful,

4351
02:53:44,413 --> 02:53:45,277
you know,

4352
02:53:45,277 --> 02:53:47,257
if you're trying to talk to
somebody about writing a piece

4353
02:53:47,257 --> 02:53:50,188
of code, it's useful to be
able to say something and,

4354
02:53:50,188 --> 02:53:52,075
and it should be possible.

4355
02:53:52,075 --> 02:53:53,434
And I think it's very frustrating.

4356
02:53:53,433 --> 02:53:54,802
It's one of those problems. I maybe I,

4357
02:53:54,802 --> 02:53:56,637
maybe this is one of these
things where I should try and get

4358
02:53:56,638 --> 02:53:58,390
an LLM to help me.

4359
02:53:58,389 --> 02:53:59,748
- How to make it speakable. How do maybe,

4360
02:53:59,748 --> 02:54:01,834
maybe it's easier than
you realize when you want.

4361
02:54:01,834 --> 02:54:03,105
- I I think it is easier.
I think it's one idea or,

4362
02:54:03,105 --> 02:54:07,051
so I think it's, I think gonna
be something where, you know,

4363
02:54:07,051 --> 02:54:09,765
the fact is it's a tree
structured language,

4364
02:54:09,765 --> 02:54:12,283
just like human language is
a tree structured language.

4365
02:54:12,283 --> 02:54:15,404
And I think it's gonna be one
of these things where one of

4366
02:54:15,405 --> 02:54:18,800
the requirements that I've had
is that whatever the spoken

4367
02:54:18,799 --> 02:54:21,102
version is, that dictation should be easy.

4368
02:54:21,102 --> 02:54:21,935
That is,

4369
02:54:21,935 --> 02:54:24,752
that shouldn't be the case that
you have to relearn how the

4370
02:54:24,753 --> 02:54:26,181
whole thing works.

4371
02:54:26,181 --> 02:54:27,849
It should be the case that, you know,

4372
02:54:27,849 --> 02:54:32,265
that open bracket is just
a ah or something and it's,

4373
02:54:33,405 --> 02:54:36,570
you know, and, and then, but you know,

4374
02:54:36,570 --> 02:54:40,628
human language has a lot
of tricks that are, I mean,

4375
02:54:40,628 --> 02:54:42,861
for example, human language has,

4376
02:54:42,861 --> 02:54:46,556
has features that are sort of optimized,

4377
02:54:46,556 --> 02:54:49,579
keep things within the bounds
that our brains can easily

4378
02:54:49,579 --> 02:54:51,320
deal with. Like I, you know,

4379
02:54:51,320 --> 02:54:55,566
I tried to teach a transformer
neural net to do parenthesis

4380
02:54:55,566 --> 02:54:57,809
matching. It's pretty crummy at that.

4381
02:54:57,809 --> 02:55:00,518
It it, and ChatGPT is
similarly quite crummy

4382
02:55:00,518 --> 02:55:02,460
at parenthesis matching.

4383
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:05,115
You can do it for small parenthesis
things for the same size

4384
02:55:05,115 --> 02:55:07,995
of parenthesis things where
if I look at it as a human,

4385
02:55:07,995 --> 02:55:09,661
I can immediately say these are matched,

4386
02:55:09,661 --> 02:55:11,210
these are not matched.

4387
02:55:11,210 --> 02:55:12,254
But as soon as it gets big,

4388
02:55:12,254 --> 02:55:14,498
as soon as it gets kind of
to the point where sort of a

4389
02:55:14,498 --> 02:55:16,697
deeper computation, it's hopeless.

4390
02:55:16,697 --> 02:55:20,172
And, but the fact is that
human language has avoided,

4391
02:55:20,172 --> 02:55:22,933
for example, the deep sub clauses.

4392
02:55:22,933 --> 02:55:24,877
You know, we don't, you know, we,

4393
02:55:24,877 --> 02:55:27,301
we arrange things that we don't
end up with these incredibly

4394
02:55:27,300 --> 02:55:30,333
deep things because
brains are not well set up

4395
02:55:30,334 --> 02:55:31,513
to deal with that.

4396
02:55:31,513 --> 02:55:32,346
And we, it,

4397
02:55:32,345 --> 02:55:34,521
it's found lots of tricks and
maybe that's what we have to

4398
02:55:34,522 --> 02:55:38,939
do to make sort of a spoken
version a human speakable

4399
02:55:40,164 --> 02:55:43,605
version because because what
we can do visually is a little

4400
02:55:43,604 --> 02:55:46,603
different than what we can do
in the very sequentially way

4401
02:55:46,603 --> 02:55:51,603
that we, that we hear things
in, in the audio domain.

4402
02:55:51,657 --> 02:55:54,398
- Let me just ask about MIT briefly.

4403
02:55:54,398 --> 02:55:56,386
So there's now there's a college
of engineering and there's

4404
02:55:56,387 --> 02:55:58,822
a new college of computing.
It's just interesting.

4405
02:55:58,822 --> 02:56:01,176
I wanna linger on this computer
science department thing.

4406
02:56:01,176 --> 02:56:04,572
So MIT has electrical
engineering, computer science.

4407
02:56:04,572 --> 02:56:06,341
- [Wolfram] Right.

4408
02:56:06,341 --> 02:56:08,754
What do you think college and
computing will be doing like

4409
02:56:08,754 --> 02:56:09,587
in 20 years?

4410
02:56:09,586 --> 02:56:12,341
What, what like, well you see this.

4411
02:56:12,342 --> 02:56:14,442
Yeah. What happens with computer science?

4412
02:56:14,441 --> 02:56:15,521
Like really.

4413
02:56:15,522 --> 02:56:17,880
- This is the question. This is, you know,

4414
02:56:17,879 --> 02:56:21,264
everybody should learn kind
of whatever CX really is.

4415
02:56:21,264 --> 02:56:22,246
Okay, this, this,

4416
02:56:22,246 --> 02:56:24,793
how to think about the
world computationally,

4417
02:56:24,793 --> 02:56:26,854
everybody should learn those concepts.

4418
02:56:26,854 --> 02:56:28,538
And you know, it's,

4419
02:56:28,538 --> 02:56:32,016
and and some people will learn
them at a quite quite formal

4420
02:56:32,016 --> 02:56:34,288
level and they'll learn
computational language

4421
02:56:34,288 --> 02:56:35,121
and things like that.

4422
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:37,611
Other people will just learn, you know,

4423
02:56:37,611 --> 02:56:40,444
sound is represented as, you know,

4424
02:56:41,417 --> 02:56:45,416
digital data and they'll get
some idea of spectrograms and

4425
02:56:45,416 --> 02:56:47,322
frequencies and things like this.

4426
02:56:47,322 --> 02:56:50,108
And maybe that doesn't, or,
or they'll learn things like,

4427
02:56:50,108 --> 02:56:52,842
you know, a lot of things that
are sort of data sciences,

4428
02:56:52,842 --> 02:56:54,250
statistics ish.

4429
02:56:54,250 --> 02:56:56,743
Like if you say, oh I've got these,

4430
02:56:56,743 --> 02:56:58,435
you know, these people who,

4431
02:56:58,435 --> 02:57:01,963
who picked their favorite
kind of candy or something and

4432
02:57:01,963 --> 02:57:04,004
I've got, you know,

4433
02:57:04,004 --> 02:57:06,272
what's the best kind of candy
given that I've done the

4434
02:57:06,272 --> 02:57:09,152
sample of all these people and
they all rank the candies in

4435
02:57:09,153 --> 02:57:10,507
different ways.

4436
02:57:10,507 --> 02:57:12,643
You know, how do you think about that?

4437
02:57:12,643 --> 02:57:15,788
That's sort of a
computational X kind of thing.

4438
02:57:15,788 --> 02:57:17,229
You might say, oh, it's,
I dunno what that is.

4439
02:57:17,229 --> 02:57:18,885
Is it statistics? Is it data science?

4440
02:57:18,885 --> 02:57:19,856
I don't really know,

4441
02:57:19,856 --> 02:57:22,388
but kind of how to think
about a question like that.

4442
02:57:22,388 --> 02:57:24,056
- Oh, like a ranking of preferences.

4443
02:57:24,057 --> 02:57:24,890
- Yeah, yeah.

4444
02:57:24,889 --> 02:57:27,762
And then how to aggregate
those, those ranked preferences.

4445
02:57:27,763 --> 02:57:29,435
Yeah. Into an overall thing.

4446
02:57:29,434 --> 02:57:30,897
You know, how does that work?

4447
02:57:30,897 --> 02:57:32,993
You know, how, how should
you think about that?

4448
02:57:32,994 --> 02:57:34,402
You know, because you can just tell,

4449
02:57:34,402 --> 02:57:37,880
you might just tell ChatGPT
sort of, I don't know,

4450
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:41,680
even even the concept of an
average, it's not obvious that,

4451
02:57:41,681 --> 02:57:43,447
you know, that's a concept that people,

4452
02:57:43,447 --> 02:57:44,909
it's worth people knowing.

4453
02:57:44,909 --> 02:57:46,361
That's a rather straightforward concept.

4454
02:57:46,361 --> 02:57:48,050
People, people, you know,

4455
02:57:48,050 --> 02:57:50,528
have learnt in kind of
mathy ways right now.

4456
02:57:50,528 --> 02:57:51,461
But there are,

4457
02:57:51,460 --> 02:57:53,550
there are lots of things like
that about how do you kind of

4458
02:57:53,550 --> 02:57:57,125
have these ways to sort of
organize and formalize the world.

4459
02:57:57,125 --> 02:57:58,974
And that's, and and these things,

4460
02:57:58,974 --> 02:58:01,938
sometimes they live in math,
sometimes they live in, in,

4461
02:58:01,938 --> 02:58:03,626
I don't know what they know.

4462
02:58:03,626 --> 02:58:04,838
I don't know what, you know,

4463
02:58:04,838 --> 02:58:05,953
learning about color space.

4464
02:58:05,953 --> 02:58:07,248
I have no idea what I mean,

4465
02:58:07,248 --> 02:58:09,004
you know, that's, that's
obviously a field of.

4466
02:58:09,004 --> 02:58:11,849
- It was, it could be vision
science or no color space,

4467
02:58:11,850 --> 02:58:13,288
you know, color space.

4468
02:58:13,288 --> 02:58:14,354
That's, that would be optics.

4469
02:58:14,354 --> 02:58:15,663
So like, depending-

4470
02:58:15,664 --> 02:58:16,827
- Not really, it's not optics.

4471
02:58:16,826 --> 02:58:17,881
Optics is about, you know,

4472
02:58:17,881 --> 02:58:20,465
lenses and chromatic aberration of lenses

4473
02:58:20,465 --> 02:58:21,554
and things like that. So.

4474
02:58:21,554 --> 02:58:23,879
- Color space is more like
design and art. Is that-?

4475
02:58:23,879 --> 02:58:25,666
- No, I mean it's, it's
like, you know, rgb space,

4476
02:58:25,665 --> 02:58:28,712
X, y, Z space, you know, hue,
saturation, brightness, space,

4477
02:58:28,712 --> 02:58:29,949
all these kinds of things,

4478
02:58:29,950 --> 02:58:31,770
these different ways to describe colors.

4479
02:58:31,770 --> 02:58:32,603
- Right.

4480
02:58:32,602 --> 02:58:35,790
But doesn't the application
define what that like be because

4481
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:39,833
obviously artists and designers
use the colors to explore.

4482
02:58:39,834 --> 02:58:41,413
- Sure. No, I mean that's just an example

4483
02:58:41,413 --> 02:58:42,905
of kind of how do you,

4484
02:58:42,905 --> 02:58:44,692
you know, the typical person, how do you,

4485
02:58:44,691 --> 02:58:47,595
how do you describe what a color is?

4486
02:58:47,595 --> 02:58:50,079
Or there are these numbers
that describe what a color is.

4487
02:58:50,079 --> 02:58:52,649
Well it's worth, you know,
if you are an eight year old,

4488
02:58:52,649 --> 02:58:55,336
you won't necessarily know, you know,

4489
02:58:55,336 --> 02:58:58,000
it's not something we're born
with to know that, you know,

4490
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,174
colors can be described by three numbers.

4491
02:59:00,174 --> 02:59:02,754
That's something that
you have to, you know,

4492
02:59:02,754 --> 02:59:05,262
it's a thing to learn about
the world, so to speak.

4493
02:59:05,262 --> 02:59:07,349
And I think that, you know,

4494
02:59:07,349 --> 02:59:10,710
that whole corpus of things
that are learning about the

4495
02:59:10,709 --> 02:59:12,715
formalization of the world

4496
02:59:12,716 --> 02:59:14,994
or the computational of the world,

4497
02:59:14,994 --> 02:59:17,136
that's something that
should be part of kind of

4498
02:59:17,136 --> 02:59:18,963
standard education.

4499
02:59:18,963 --> 02:59:21,152
And you know, there isn't a a, you know,

4500
02:59:21,152 --> 02:59:22,879
there isn't a course
or curriculum for that.

4501
02:59:22,879 --> 02:59:23,837
And by the way,

4502
02:59:23,836 --> 02:59:26,128
whatever might have been in
it just got changed cause of

4503
02:59:26,129 --> 02:59:27,522
LLMs and so on.

4504
02:59:27,522 --> 02:59:29,201
- Significantly. And I would,

4505
02:59:29,200 --> 02:59:33,014
I'm watching closely
with interest seeing how

4506
02:59:33,014 --> 02:59:34,672
universities adapt.

4507
02:59:34,673 --> 02:59:35,615
- Well, you know, so,

4508
02:59:35,615 --> 02:59:39,699
so one of my projects for
hopefully this year, I don't know,

4509
02:59:39,699 --> 02:59:42,015
is to try and write sort of a,

4510
02:59:42,014 --> 02:59:44,629
a reasonable textbook so to speak,

4511
02:59:44,629 --> 02:59:48,123
of whatever this thing cx
whatever it is, you know,

4512
02:59:48,123 --> 02:59:49,949
what should you know, you know,

4513
02:59:49,949 --> 02:59:52,157
what should you know
about like what a bug is?

4514
02:59:52,156 --> 02:59:54,243
What is the intuition about
bugs, what's intuition about,

4515
02:59:54,244 --> 02:59:55,584
you know, software testing?

4516
02:59:55,584 --> 02:59:56,918
What is it? What is it?

4517
02:59:56,917 --> 02:59:59,653
You know, these are things which
are, you know, they're not,

4518
02:59:59,653 --> 03:00:02,292
I mean those are things
which have gotten taught in,

4519
03:00:02,292 --> 03:00:05,068
in computer science as part
of the trade of programming.

4520
03:00:05,068 --> 03:00:06,851
But, but kind of the,

4521
03:00:06,852 --> 03:00:09,520
the conceptual points about
what these things are, you know,

4522
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:12,028
it's surprised me just at a
very practical level, you know,

4523
03:00:12,028 --> 03:00:14,559
I wrote this little explainer
thing about ChatGPT and I

4524
03:00:14,559 --> 03:00:16,443
thought, well, you know,

4525
03:00:16,443 --> 03:00:18,627
I'm writing this partly
because I wanted to make sure I

4526
03:00:18,628 --> 03:00:21,282
understood it myself and and so on.

4527
03:00:21,281 --> 03:00:22,483
And it's been, you know,

4528
03:00:22,484 --> 03:00:26,336
it's been really popular
and surprisingly so.

4529
03:00:26,335 --> 03:00:29,584
And I, and I then I realized,
well actually, you know,

4530
03:00:29,584 --> 03:00:30,800
I was sort of assuming,

4531
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:32,170
I didn't really think about it actually.

4532
03:00:32,170 --> 03:00:34,138
I just thought, this is
something I can write.

4533
03:00:34,138 --> 03:00:37,669
And I realized actually it's
a level of description that is

4534
03:00:37,668 --> 03:00:40,343
kind of, you know, what has to be,

4535
03:00:40,343 --> 03:00:43,126
it's not the engineering
level description,

4536
03:00:43,127 --> 03:00:46,453
it's not the kind of just the qualitative

4537
03:00:46,453 --> 03:00:47,512
kind of description.

4538
03:00:47,512 --> 03:00:50,644
It's some kind of sort of expository,

4539
03:00:50,644 --> 03:00:53,646
mechanistic description of
what's going on together with

4540
03:00:53,646 --> 03:00:55,384
kind of the bigger
picture of the philosophy

4541
03:00:55,384 --> 03:00:56,707
of things and so on.

4542
03:00:56,707 --> 03:00:58,640
And I realized actually this
is a pretty good thing for me

4543
03:00:58,640 --> 03:01:00,701
to write. I, you know, I
kind of know those things.

4544
03:01:00,701 --> 03:01:04,396
And I kind of realized it's not
a collection of things that,

4545
03:01:04,397 --> 03:01:07,431
you know, it's, it's, I've sort of been,

4546
03:01:07,431 --> 03:01:09,967
I was sort of a little shocked
that it's as much of an

4547
03:01:09,967 --> 03:01:12,307
outlier in terms of explaining
what's going on as it's

4548
03:01:12,307 --> 03:01:13,843
turned out to be.

4549
03:01:13,843 --> 03:01:16,434
And that makes me feel more
of an obligation to kind of

4550
03:01:16,433 --> 03:01:19,663
write the kind of, you
know, what is, you know,

4551
03:01:19,664 --> 03:01:21,871
what is this thing that
you should learn about,

4552
03:01:21,870 --> 03:01:23,550
about the compute digitalization,

4553
03:01:23,550 --> 03:01:25,218
the formalization of the world,

4554
03:01:25,218 --> 03:01:28,756
cause well I've spent much of
my life working on the kind of

4555
03:01:28,756 --> 03:01:32,118
tooling and mechanics of that
and the science you get from

4556
03:01:32,118 --> 03:01:33,968
it. So I guess this is my,

4557
03:01:33,968 --> 03:01:36,224
my kind of obligation to try to do this.

4558
03:01:36,224 --> 03:01:37,057
But I think,

4559
03:01:37,057 --> 03:01:38,452
so if you ask what's gonna
happen to like the computer

4560
03:01:38,451 --> 03:01:41,381
science departments and so on, there's,

4561
03:01:41,381 --> 03:01:42,881
there's some interesting models.

4562
03:01:42,881 --> 03:01:43,715
So for example,

4563
03:01:43,715 --> 03:01:45,344
let's take math, you know,

4564
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:47,216
math is a thing that's important for,

4565
03:01:47,217 --> 03:01:49,998
for all sorts of fields, you
know, engineering, you know,

4566
03:01:49,998 --> 03:01:53,236
even, you know, chemistry,
psychology, whatever else.

4567
03:01:53,236 --> 03:01:56,643
And I think different universities
have kind of evolved that

4568
03:01:56,644 --> 03:01:57,798
differently. I mean,

4569
03:01:57,798 --> 03:02:01,335
some say all the math is taught
in the math department and

4570
03:02:01,334 --> 03:02:03,965
some say, well, we're
gonna have a, you know,

4571
03:02:03,966 --> 03:02:06,483
a math for chemists or
something that is taught in the

4572
03:02:06,483 --> 03:02:08,513
chemistry department.

4573
03:02:08,513 --> 03:02:11,091
And you know, I think that this,

4574
03:02:11,091 --> 03:02:13,299
this question of whether there
is a centralization of the

4575
03:02:13,299 --> 03:02:18,244
teaching of sort of CX is
an interesting question.

4576
03:02:18,244 --> 03:02:21,317
And I think, you know, the
way it evolved with math,

4577
03:02:21,316 --> 03:02:24,821
you know, people understood
that math was sort of a,

4578
03:02:24,822 --> 03:02:29,478
a separately teachable thing
and was kind of a, a, you know,

4579
03:02:29,477 --> 03:02:34,477
a a an independent element as
opposed to just being absorbed

4580
03:02:34,591 --> 03:02:37,109
into out now. So if you
take the example of, of,

4581
03:02:37,109 --> 03:02:39,930
of writing English or something like this,

4582
03:02:39,930 --> 03:02:43,506
the first point is that, that, you know,

4583
03:02:43,506 --> 03:02:46,793
at the college level, at
least at fancy colleges,

4584
03:02:46,793 --> 03:02:49,138
there's a certain amount
of English writing that,

4585
03:02:49,138 --> 03:02:50,635
that people do.

4586
03:02:50,636 --> 03:02:53,095
But mostly it's kind of assumed
that they pretty much know

4587
03:02:53,094 --> 03:02:56,299
how to write, you know, that's
something they learnt at a,

4588
03:02:56,299 --> 03:02:58,326
at an earlier stage in education,

4589
03:02:58,326 --> 03:03:00,485
maybe rightly or wrongly believing that.

4590
03:03:00,486 --> 03:03:02,595
But that's different.

4591
03:03:02,594 --> 03:03:03,516
Different issue.

4592
03:03:03,516 --> 03:03:05,602
The well I think it,

4593
03:03:05,602 --> 03:03:08,173
it, it reminds me of my kind of a,

4594
03:03:08,174 --> 03:03:11,399
as I've tried to help
people do technical writing

4595
03:03:11,398 --> 03:03:12,850
and things, I'm, I'm always reminded

4596
03:03:12,851 --> 03:03:15,177
of my zero floor of technical writing,

4597
03:03:15,177 --> 03:03:18,273
which is if you don't understand
what you are writing about,

4598
03:03:18,273 --> 03:03:20,481
your readers do not stand a chance. Yeah.

4599
03:03:20,481 --> 03:03:25,148
And so it's, it's, I think
the, the thing that has some,

4600
03:03:27,299 --> 03:03:32,299
you know, in, in, when it comes
to like writing for example,

4601
03:03:32,317 --> 03:03:33,490
you know,

4602
03:03:33,490 --> 03:03:35,639
people in different fields
are expected to write English

4603
03:03:35,639 --> 03:03:40,174
essays and they're not, you
know, mostly the, you know,

4604
03:03:40,174 --> 03:03:44,086
the history department or
the engineering department.

4605
03:03:44,086 --> 03:03:47,591
They don't have their own, you
know, let's, you know, it's,

4606
03:03:47,591 --> 03:03:49,377
it's not like there's a,

4607
03:03:49,377 --> 03:03:51,492
I mean it's a thing which sort
of people are assumed to have

4608
03:03:51,492 --> 03:03:54,849
a knowledge of how to write
that they can use in all these

4609
03:03:54,849 --> 03:03:56,350
different fields.

4610
03:03:56,350 --> 03:03:58,127
And the question is, you know,

4611
03:03:58,127 --> 03:04:01,199
some level of knowledge of
math is kind of assumed by the

4612
03:04:01,199 --> 03:04:05,197
time you get to the college
level, but plenty is not.

4613
03:04:05,197 --> 03:04:07,210
And that's sort of still centrally taught.

4614
03:04:07,209 --> 03:04:11,218
The question is sort of how
tall is the tower of kind of CX

4615
03:04:11,218 --> 03:04:15,036
that you need before you can
just go use it in all these

4616
03:04:15,037 --> 03:04:16,367
different fields.

4617
03:04:16,367 --> 03:04:17,200
And you know,

4618
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:20,268
there will be experts who want
to learn the full elaborate

4619
03:04:20,268 --> 03:04:22,403
tower and that will be kind of the,

4620
03:04:22,403 --> 03:04:25,210
the CS CX whatever department.

4621
03:04:25,209 --> 03:04:28,640
But there'll also be everybody
else who just needs to know a

4622
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:31,005
certain amount of that to be
able to go and do their art

4623
03:04:31,005 --> 03:04:33,172
history classes and so on.

4624
03:04:34,631 --> 03:04:35,465
- Yes.

4625
03:04:35,465 --> 03:04:38,086
It's just a single class that
everybody's required to take.

4626
03:04:38,086 --> 03:04:40,313
- I don't know, I don't
know how big it is yet.

4627
03:04:40,313 --> 03:04:42,757
I hope to kind of define this
curriculum and I'll figure out

4628
03:04:42,757 --> 03:04:47,091
whether it's some, my guess
is that I, I don't know,

4629
03:04:48,183 --> 03:04:50,879
I don't really understand
universities and professoring that

4630
03:04:50,879 --> 03:04:54,575
well. But my, my rough
guess would be a year long,

4631
03:04:54,575 --> 03:04:58,716
a year of college class will
be enough to get to the point

4632
03:04:58,717 --> 03:05:02,510
where most people have a, a
reasonably broad knowledge of,

4633
03:05:02,510 --> 03:05:03,343
you know,

4634
03:05:03,343 --> 03:05:07,912
we'll be sort of literate in
this kind of computational way

4635
03:05:07,912 --> 03:05:09,588
of thinking about things.

4636
03:05:09,588 --> 03:05:11,699
- Yeah. Basic literacy. Right.

4637
03:05:11,699 --> 03:05:14,604
I'm still stuck perhaps
cause I'm hungry in the,

4638
03:05:14,603 --> 03:05:17,984
in the rating of human
preferences for candy.

4639
03:05:17,985 --> 03:05:19,873
So I have to ask, what's the best candy?

4640
03:05:19,872 --> 03:05:21,875
I like this ELO rating for candy.

4641
03:05:21,875 --> 03:05:24,275
Somebody should come up because
you're somebody who says you

4642
03:05:24,275 --> 03:05:26,494
like chocolate. What's, what
do you think is the best I'll,

4643
03:05:26,494 --> 03:05:29,614
I'll probably put milk duds up there.

4644
03:05:29,614 --> 03:05:30,984
I don't know if you know. Hmm.

4645
03:05:30,984 --> 03:05:33,034
I do you have a preference
for chocolate or candy? Oh.

4646
03:05:33,034 --> 03:05:34,344
- I have lots of
preferences. I've, I've, I,

4647
03:05:34,344 --> 03:05:38,050
one of my all-time favorites
is my whole life is these

4648
03:05:38,050 --> 03:05:41,456
things, these flake
things, Cadbury flakes,

4649
03:05:41,456 --> 03:05:44,123
which are not much sold
in the US And I've,

4650
03:05:44,123 --> 03:05:46,186
I've always thought that
was a sign of a, of a,

4651
03:05:46,186 --> 03:05:49,076
a lack of respect for
the American consumer

4652
03:05:49,076 --> 03:05:51,440
because they're these
sort of aerated chocolate

4653
03:05:51,441 --> 03:05:52,472
that's made in a,

4654
03:05:52,472 --> 03:05:54,658
in a whole sort of, it's kind of a,

4655
03:05:54,658 --> 03:05:57,645
a sheet of chocolate that's
kind of folded up and when you

4656
03:05:57,645 --> 03:06:01,533
eat it flakes fall all over the place.

4657
03:06:01,533 --> 03:06:04,051
- Ah. So it requires a kind of elegance.

4658
03:06:04,051 --> 03:06:05,817
It requires you to have an elegance.

4659
03:06:05,817 --> 03:06:08,325
- Well I know what I, what I
usually do is I eat them on a,

4660
03:06:08,325 --> 03:06:10,004
you know, on a piece
of paper or something.

4661
03:06:10,004 --> 03:06:11,710
- You embrace the mask
and clean it up after.

4662
03:06:11,710 --> 03:06:14,364
- No, I actually eat
the, I eat the flakes.

4663
03:06:14,364 --> 03:06:16,476
Oh. They're the, cause it,
you know, it turns out the,

4664
03:06:16,476 --> 03:06:18,862
the way food tastes depends a
lot on its physical structure

4665
03:06:18,861 --> 03:06:20,610
and you know, it really, you know,

4666
03:06:20,611 --> 03:06:22,282
I've noticed when I eat
pieces of chocolate,

4667
03:06:22,281 --> 03:06:24,190
I usually have some little
pieces of chocolate and I,

4668
03:06:24,191 --> 03:06:26,577
I always break off little pieces
partly cause then I eat it

4669
03:06:26,576 --> 03:06:28,257
less fast. Yeah.

4670
03:06:28,257 --> 03:06:31,149
But also cause it actually
tastes different, you know,

4671
03:06:31,149 --> 03:06:33,907
the the the small pieces,
you know, have a different,

4672
03:06:33,907 --> 03:06:36,104
you have a different experience
than if you have the big

4673
03:06:36,104 --> 03:06:37,979
slab of chocolate.

4674
03:06:37,979 --> 03:06:39,046
- For many reasons. Yes.

4675
03:06:39,046 --> 03:06:40,879
Slower, more intimate.

4676
03:06:42,318 --> 03:06:45,255
- Well I think it's also
just a pure physicality.

4677
03:06:45,255 --> 03:06:46,088
- [Fridman] Well the texture changes.

4678
03:06:46,088 --> 03:06:47,076
- Yeah. Right.

4679
03:06:47,076 --> 03:06:48,388
- [Fridman] That's fascinating.

4680
03:06:48,388 --> 03:06:49,221
Now I take back my milk duds.

4681
03:06:49,221 --> 03:06:50,604
Cause that's such a basic answer. Okay.

4682
03:06:50,604 --> 03:06:55,604
Do you think consciousness is
fundamentally computational?

4683
03:06:56,229 --> 03:06:59,225
So when you're thinking about cx,

4684
03:06:59,225 --> 03:07:01,891
what can we turn to computation?

4685
03:07:03,091 --> 03:07:06,296
And you're thinking about LLMs,

4686
03:07:06,296 --> 03:07:09,729
do you think the the display
of consciousness and the

4687
03:07:09,729 --> 03:07:12,693
experience of consciousness,
the hard problem is,

4688
03:07:12,693 --> 03:07:15,277
is fundamentally a computation.

4689
03:07:16,712 --> 03:07:20,105
- Yeah. What it feels
like inside, so to speak.

4690
03:07:20,105 --> 03:07:21,189
- [Fridman] Yeah.

4691
03:07:21,189 --> 03:07:22,976
- Is, you know,

4692
03:07:22,976 --> 03:07:26,855
I did a little exercise
eventually I'll post it,

4693
03:07:26,855 --> 03:07:30,025
of you know, what it's
like to be a computer.

4694
03:07:30,025 --> 03:07:31,164
Yeah. Right.

4695
03:07:31,165 --> 03:07:32,498
It's kind of like,

4696
03:07:32,497 --> 03:07:35,354
well you get all this sensory
input you have kind of,

4697
03:07:35,354 --> 03:07:38,185
the way I see it is from the
time you boot a computer to the

4698
03:07:38,185 --> 03:07:39,984
time the computer crashes.

4699
03:07:39,984 --> 03:07:41,798
It's like a human life.

4700
03:07:41,798 --> 03:07:44,498
You, you're building up a certain
amount of state in memory.

4701
03:07:44,497 --> 03:07:46,365
You remember certain things about your

4702
03:07:46,365 --> 03:07:48,129
quotes life eventually.

4703
03:07:48,129 --> 03:07:50,246
It's kind of like the, the, you know,

4704
03:07:50,246 --> 03:07:52,415
the next generation of humans is,

4705
03:07:52,415 --> 03:07:55,286
is born from the same genetic
material, so to speak,

4706
03:07:55,286 --> 03:07:59,702
with a little bit left over,
left on the disk, so to speak.

4707
03:07:59,702 --> 03:08:00,959
And then, you know, the the,

4708
03:08:00,959 --> 03:08:02,917
the new fresh generation starts up.

4709
03:08:02,917 --> 03:08:04,860
And eventually all kinds
of crud builds up in the,

4710
03:08:04,861 --> 03:08:07,407
in the memory of the computer
and eventually the thing

4711
03:08:07,406 --> 03:08:08,618
crashes or whatever.

4712
03:08:08,619 --> 03:08:10,514
Or maybe it has some trauma
because you plugged in some

4713
03:08:10,513 --> 03:08:13,221
weird thing to some port of the computer

4714
03:08:13,221 --> 03:08:14,933
and that made it crash.

4715
03:08:14,933 --> 03:08:18,078
And that, you know, that
that's kind of, but,

4716
03:08:18,078 --> 03:08:20,718
but you have this, this
picture of, you know, from,

4717
03:08:20,718 --> 03:08:24,811
from startup to, to,
to shut down, you know,

4718
03:08:24,811 --> 03:08:26,862
what is the life of a
computer, so to speak,

4719
03:08:26,862 --> 03:08:29,037
and what does it feel like
to be that computer and what

4720
03:08:29,037 --> 03:08:31,711
inner thoughts does it have
and how do you describe it?

4721
03:08:31,711 --> 03:08:32,545
And it's kind of,

4722
03:08:32,545 --> 03:08:34,710
kind of interesting as you
start writing about this to

4723
03:08:34,709 --> 03:08:37,747
realize it's awfully like what
you'd say about yourself that

4724
03:08:37,747 --> 03:08:40,927
is, it's awfully like even
a, an ordinary computer,

4725
03:08:40,927 --> 03:08:43,700
forget it all the AI
stuff and so on, you know,

4726
03:08:43,700 --> 03:08:45,908
it's kind of, it has a memory of the past,

4727
03:08:45,907 --> 03:08:48,786
it has certain sensory experiences.

4728
03:08:48,786 --> 03:08:50,863
It can communicate with other computers,

4729
03:08:50,863 --> 03:08:54,043
but it has to package up how
it's communicating in some kind

4730
03:08:54,043 --> 03:08:56,924
of language like form so
it can, you know, send,

4731
03:08:56,924 --> 03:09:00,389
so it can kind of map what's
in its memory to what's in the

4732
03:09:00,389 --> 03:09:02,309
memory of some other computer.

4733
03:09:02,309 --> 03:09:04,534
It's, it's a surprisingly similar thing.

4734
03:09:04,534 --> 03:09:06,886
You know, I hadn't experienced
just a week or two ago,

4735
03:09:06,886 --> 03:09:07,719
I, I had,

4736
03:09:07,718 --> 03:09:09,551
I'm a collector of all possible data

4737
03:09:09,551 --> 03:09:10,885
about myself and other things.

4738
03:09:10,885 --> 03:09:12,804
And so I, you know,

4739
03:09:12,804 --> 03:09:15,385
I collect all sorts of weird
medical data and so on.

4740
03:09:15,385 --> 03:09:18,252
And one thing I hadn't collected
was I'd never had a whole

4741
03:09:18,252 --> 03:09:19,979
body MRI scan.

4742
03:09:19,978 --> 03:09:21,479
So I went and got one of these.

4743
03:09:21,479 --> 03:09:22,313
- [Fridman] Nice.

4744
03:09:22,313 --> 03:09:23,627
- Okay. So I get the, get
all the data back, right.

4745
03:09:23,627 --> 03:09:24,632
I'm looking at this thing,

4746
03:09:24,632 --> 03:09:26,915
I've never looked at the
kind of insides of my brain,

4747
03:09:26,915 --> 03:09:30,049
so to speak, in, in physical form.

4748
03:09:30,049 --> 03:09:31,316
And it's really, I mean, it,

4749
03:09:31,316 --> 03:09:34,378
it's kind of psychologically
shocking in a sense that,

4750
03:09:34,379 --> 03:09:35,212
you know,

4751
03:09:35,211 --> 03:09:38,004
here's this thing and you can
see it has all these folds and

4752
03:09:38,004 --> 03:09:39,567
all these, you know, this structure.

4753
03:09:39,567 --> 03:09:40,400
And it's like,

4754
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:43,501
that's where this experience
that I'm having of, you know,

4755
03:09:43,501 --> 03:09:45,827
existing and so on. Yeah.

4756
03:09:45,827 --> 03:09:47,260
That's where it is.

4757
03:09:47,260 --> 03:09:50,237
And you know, it feels
very, you know, you,

4758
03:09:50,236 --> 03:09:51,918
you look at that and you're thinking,

4759
03:09:51,918 --> 03:09:54,340
how can this possibly be
all this experience that I'm

4760
03:09:54,340 --> 03:09:56,022
having? And you're realizing,

4761
03:09:56,022 --> 03:09:57,267
well I can look at a
computer as well and it's,

4762
03:09:57,266 --> 03:10:00,737
it's kind of this, it, it, it, it,

4763
03:10:00,737 --> 03:10:05,654
I think this idea that you are
having an experience that is

4764
03:10:06,829 --> 03:10:08,329
somehow, you know,

4765
03:10:10,073 --> 03:10:14,238
transcends the mere sort of
physicality of that experience.

4766
03:10:14,237 --> 03:10:16,034
I, I, I, you know,

4767
03:10:16,034 --> 03:10:18,257
it's something that's hard
to come to terms with,

4768
03:10:18,257 --> 03:10:19,949
but I think, you know, and I,

4769
03:10:19,950 --> 03:10:21,824
I don't think I've
necessarily, you know, my,

4770
03:10:21,824 --> 03:10:25,095
my personal experience, you
know, I look at the, you know,

4771
03:10:25,094 --> 03:10:27,399
the MRI of the brain and then I, you know,

4772
03:10:27,399 --> 03:10:29,824
know about all kinds of things
about neuroscience and all

4773
03:10:29,825 --> 03:10:30,953
that kind of stuff.

4774
03:10:30,952 --> 03:10:34,046
And I still feel the
way I feel so to speak.

4775
03:10:34,046 --> 03:10:36,605
And it, it sort of seems disconnected,

4776
03:10:36,605 --> 03:10:39,065
but yet as I try and rationalize it,

4777
03:10:39,065 --> 03:10:42,545
I can't really say that there's
something kind of different

4778
03:10:42,545 --> 03:10:46,000
about how I intrinsically
feel from the thing that I can

4779
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,879
plainly see in the sort of
physicality of what's going on.

4780
03:10:48,879 --> 03:10:50,802
- [Fridman] So do you think the computer,

4781
03:10:50,802 --> 03:10:54,246
a large language model will
experience that transcendence?

4782
03:10:54,246 --> 03:10:55,340
How does that make you feel?

4783
03:10:55,341 --> 03:10:57,358
Like I I tend to believe it will.

4784
03:10:57,358 --> 03:10:59,719
- I think an ordinary
computer is already there.

4785
03:10:59,718 --> 03:11:02,195
I think an ordinary computer is already,

4786
03:11:02,195 --> 03:11:03,672
you know, kind of, it's,

4787
03:11:03,672 --> 03:11:07,006
it's now a large language model
may experience it in a way

4788
03:11:07,005 --> 03:11:09,561
that is much better
aligned with us humans.

4789
03:11:09,561 --> 03:11:11,515
That is, it's much more, you know,

4790
03:11:11,515 --> 03:11:15,346
if you could have the
discussion with the computer,

4791
03:11:15,346 --> 03:11:17,831
it's intelligence so to speak,

4792
03:11:17,831 --> 03:11:20,059
is not particularly
well aligned with ours.

4793
03:11:20,059 --> 03:11:22,521
But the large language model is, you know,

4794
03:11:22,522 --> 03:11:24,680
it's built to be aligned with our way

4795
03:11:24,680 --> 03:11:25,916
of thinking about things.

4796
03:11:25,916 --> 03:11:27,091
- [Fridman] It would be able to explain

4797
03:11:27,091 --> 03:11:30,489
that it's afraid of being
shut off and deleted.

4798
03:11:30,489 --> 03:11:34,327
It'd be able to say that it's
sad of the way you've been

4799
03:11:34,327 --> 03:11:35,731
speaking to it over the past two days.

4800
03:11:35,731 --> 03:11:36,975
- Right. But you know,

4801
03:11:36,975 --> 03:11:38,041
that's a weird thing because

4802
03:11:38,040 --> 03:11:41,207
when it says it's afraid of something.

4803
03:11:42,436 --> 03:11:44,795
We know that it got
that idea from the fact

4804
03:11:44,795 --> 03:11:46,649
that it read on the internet.

4805
03:11:46,649 --> 03:11:48,825
- Yeah. Where did you get it, Steven?

4806
03:11:48,825 --> 03:11:50,389
Where did you get it when
you say you're afraid?

4807
03:11:50,389 --> 03:11:51,584
- You acquaint, that's the question.

4808
03:11:51,584 --> 03:11:52,417
Right.

4809
03:11:52,417 --> 03:11:54,967
- [Fridman] I mean it's it's
your parents, your friends.

4810
03:11:54,967 --> 03:11:56,649
- Right. Or, or my biology.

4811
03:11:56,648 --> 03:11:59,406
I mean, in other words, there's
a certain amount that is,

4812
03:11:59,406 --> 03:12:02,144
you know, the endocrine system
kicking in and, and you know,

4813
03:12:02,145 --> 03:12:06,703
the the these kinds of emotional
overlay type things that

4814
03:12:06,703 --> 03:12:07,725
happen to be,

4815
03:12:07,725 --> 03:12:11,023
that are actually much more
physical even they're much more

4816
03:12:11,022 --> 03:12:14,210
sort of straightforwardly
chemical than the,

4817
03:12:14,210 --> 03:12:17,396
the than kind of all of
the higher level thinking.

4818
03:12:17,397 --> 03:12:18,536
- Yeah but your biology didn't tell you

4819
03:12:18,536 --> 03:12:20,563
to say I'm afraid just at the right time

4820
03:12:20,563 --> 03:12:22,594
when people that love you are listening

4821
03:12:22,593 --> 03:12:25,484
and so, you know, you're
manipulating them by saying,

4822
03:12:25,485 --> 03:12:27,693
so that's not your biology. That's-

4823
03:12:27,692 --> 03:12:30,161
- [Wolfram] No, that's a
well, but the, you know.

4824
03:12:30,162 --> 03:12:31,739
- It's a large language model in that

4825
03:12:31,739 --> 03:12:33,708
biological neural network of yours.

4826
03:12:33,708 --> 03:12:37,522
- Yes. But I mean, the
intrinsic thing of, you know,

4827
03:12:37,522 --> 03:12:41,047
something sort of shocking is
just happening and you have

4828
03:12:41,047 --> 03:12:43,652
some sure sort of reaction,
which is, you know,

4829
03:12:43,652 --> 03:12:47,808
some neurotransmitter gets
secreted and it, it's, you know,

4830
03:12:47,808 --> 03:12:50,855
that that is the beginning
of some, you know, that is,

4831
03:12:50,854 --> 03:12:54,309
that's one of the pieces
of input that then drives,

4832
03:12:54,309 --> 03:12:57,313
it's kind of like the, like a prompt for,

4833
03:12:57,313 --> 03:12:59,443
for the large language model. I mean,

4834
03:12:59,443 --> 03:13:01,773
just like when we dream
for example, you know,

4835
03:13:01,773 --> 03:13:04,501
no doubt there are all
these sort of random inputs

4836
03:13:04,502 --> 03:13:05,335
that kind of,

4837
03:13:05,334 --> 03:13:08,687
these random prompts and then
it's percolating through in

4838
03:13:08,688 --> 03:13:11,435
kind of the way that a large
language model does of kind of

4839
03:13:11,435 --> 03:13:14,316
putting together things
that seem meaningful.

4840
03:13:14,316 --> 03:13:15,611
- I I mean, are you,

4841
03:13:15,611 --> 03:13:17,652
are you worried about
this world where you,

4842
03:13:17,653 --> 03:13:20,736
you teach a lot on the internet
and there's people asking

4843
03:13:20,736 --> 03:13:24,142
questions and comments and so on.

4844
03:13:24,141 --> 03:13:26,266
You have people that work remotely.

4845
03:13:26,266 --> 03:13:31,266
Are you worried about this
world when large language models

4846
03:13:31,341 --> 03:13:35,757
create human-like bots that
are leaving the comments,

4847
03:13:37,415 --> 03:13:41,542
asking the questions? Or might
even become fake employees?

4848
03:13:41,542 --> 03:13:42,912
- [Wolfram] Yeah.

4849
03:13:42,912 --> 03:13:43,859
- I mean, or,

4850
03:13:43,859 --> 03:13:48,217
or or worse are better at
yet friends friends of yours.

4851
03:13:48,217 --> 03:13:49,369
- Right. Look, I mean,

4852
03:13:49,369 --> 03:13:54,012
one point is my mode of life
has been I build tools and then

4853
03:13:54,012 --> 03:13:55,681
I use the tools.

4854
03:13:55,681 --> 03:13:57,530
And in a sense kind of, you know, I'm,

4855
03:13:57,530 --> 03:13:59,773
I'm building this tower of automation.

4856
03:13:59,772 --> 03:14:02,388
Which, you know, and,
and in a sense, you know,

4857
03:14:02,388 --> 03:14:04,708
when you make a company or something,

4858
03:14:04,709 --> 03:14:06,659
you are making sort of automation

4859
03:14:06,658 --> 03:14:08,331
but it has some humans in it.

4860
03:14:08,331 --> 03:14:09,164
- [Fridman] Yes.

4861
03:14:09,164 --> 03:14:12,086
- But also as much as possible
it has, it has, you know,

4862
03:14:12,085 --> 03:14:13,345
computers in it.

4863
03:14:13,345 --> 03:14:15,878
And so I think it's sort of
an extension of that now.

4864
03:14:15,879 --> 03:14:20,295
Now if I really didn't know
that, you know, it's a, it's a,

4865
03:14:20,295 --> 03:14:21,974
it's a funny question. I mean it's a,

4866
03:14:21,974 --> 03:14:24,157
it's a funny issue when, you know,

4867
03:14:24,157 --> 03:14:26,296
if we think about sort of what's
gonna happen to the future

4868
03:14:26,296 --> 03:14:28,347
of kind of jobs people do and so on.

4869
03:14:28,347 --> 03:14:31,213
And there are places where kind of having

4870
03:14:31,213 --> 03:14:32,440
a human in the loop,

4871
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:34,457
there are different reasons
to have a human in the loop.

4872
03:14:34,457 --> 03:14:35,369
For example,

4873
03:14:35,369 --> 03:14:36,202
you might want a human in the loop

4874
03:14:36,201 --> 03:14:38,009
cause you want somebody to,

4875
03:14:38,009 --> 03:14:40,959
you want another human to
be invested in the outcome.

4876
03:14:40,959 --> 03:14:41,792
You know,

4877
03:14:41,792 --> 03:14:43,708
you want a human flying the
plane who's gonna die if the

4878
03:14:43,708 --> 03:14:46,807
plane crashes along with you so to speak.

4879
03:14:46,807 --> 03:14:49,120
And that gives you sort of
confidence that the right thing

4880
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:51,976
is going to happen or
you might want, you know,

4881
03:14:51,976 --> 03:14:55,351
right now you might want a human
in the loop in some kind of

4882
03:14:55,351 --> 03:14:59,213
sort of human encouragement,
persuasion type profession.

4883
03:14:59,213 --> 03:15:00,583
Whether that will continue,

4884
03:15:00,583 --> 03:15:02,537
I'm not sure for those
types of professions.

4885
03:15:02,537 --> 03:15:06,351
Cause it may be that the,
the greater efficiency of,

4886
03:15:06,351 --> 03:15:07,371
you know,

4887
03:15:07,370 --> 03:15:10,191
of being able to have sort
of just the right information

4888
03:15:10,191 --> 03:15:13,636
delivered at just the right
time will overcome the kind of

4889
03:15:13,637 --> 03:15:16,719
the the the kind of, oh
yes, I want a human there.

4890
03:15:16,718 --> 03:15:21,306
- Yeah. Imagine like a
therapist or even higher stake,

4891
03:15:21,307 --> 03:15:25,336
like a suicide hotline operated
by a large language model.

4892
03:15:25,335 --> 03:15:26,168
[Wolfram] Yeah.

4893
03:15:26,168 --> 03:15:29,006
- Oh boy. It's a pretty
high stake situation.

4894
03:15:29,006 --> 03:15:30,674
- Right. But I mean, but you know,

4895
03:15:30,674 --> 03:15:32,809
it might in fact do the right thing.

4896
03:15:32,809 --> 03:15:35,533
Because it might be the
case that that, you know,

4897
03:15:35,533 --> 03:15:39,627
and that's really a partly
a question of sort of how

4898
03:15:39,627 --> 03:15:41,594
complicated is the human, you know,

4899
03:15:41,593 --> 03:15:44,582
one of the things that's that's
always surprising in some

4900
03:15:44,583 --> 03:15:46,320
sense is that, you know,

4901
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:48,695
sometimes human psychology
is not that complicated

4902
03:15:48,695 --> 03:15:49,682
in some sense.

4903
03:15:49,682 --> 03:15:52,548
- You wrote the blog
post, the 50 Year Quest,

4904
03:15:52,548 --> 03:15:54,697
my personal journey, good title,

4905
03:15:54,697 --> 03:15:57,622
my personal journey with the
second law thermodynamics.

4906
03:15:57,622 --> 03:16:02,622
So what is this law and what
have you understood about it in

4907
03:16:02,931 --> 03:16:05,783
the 50 year journey you had with it?

4908
03:16:05,782 --> 03:16:07,657
- Right. So second law of thermodynamics,

4909
03:16:07,657 --> 03:16:11,028
sometimes called law of entropy
increase is this principle

4910
03:16:11,029 --> 03:16:13,729
of physics that says, well,

4911
03:16:13,728 --> 03:16:16,813
my version of it would be
things tend to get more random

4912
03:16:16,814 --> 03:16:17,647
over time.

4913
03:16:18,659 --> 03:16:21,923
A version of it that there
are many different sort of

4914
03:16:21,924 --> 03:16:25,538
formulations of it that are
things like heat doesn't

4915
03:16:25,538 --> 03:16:29,112
spontaneously go from a hotter
body to a colder one when you

4916
03:16:29,111 --> 03:16:33,694
have mechanical work kind of
gets dissipated into heat.

4917
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:36,468
You have friction and,

4918
03:16:36,468 --> 03:16:39,229
and kind of when you
systematically move things,

4919
03:16:39,229 --> 03:16:41,604
eventually they'll be,
they'll be sort of the,

4920
03:16:41,604 --> 03:16:43,823
the energy of of moving
things gets kind of

4921
03:16:43,823 --> 03:16:45,477
ground down into heat.

4922
03:16:45,477 --> 03:16:50,015
So people first sort of paid
attention to this back in the

4923
03:16:50,014 --> 03:16:54,128
1820s when steam engines were a big thing.

4924
03:16:54,129 --> 03:16:56,159
And the big question was how efficient

4925
03:16:56,158 --> 03:16:57,932
could a steam engine be?

4926
03:16:57,933 --> 03:17:00,958
And there's this chap called
Saddi Carno who was a,

4927
03:17:00,958 --> 03:17:03,935
a French engineer actually.

4928
03:17:03,934 --> 03:17:08,418
His father was a a a sort of
elaborate mathematical engineer

4929
03:17:08,418 --> 03:17:09,748
in, in France.

4930
03:17:09,748 --> 03:17:12,451
But he figured out these,

4931
03:17:12,451 --> 03:17:16,627
this kind of rules for
how kind of the, the,

4932
03:17:16,628 --> 03:17:19,445
the efficiency of, of the
possible efficiency of a,

4933
03:17:19,445 --> 03:17:21,443
of something like a steam engine.

4934
03:17:21,443 --> 03:17:23,506
And in sort of a side,

4935
03:17:23,506 --> 03:17:27,971
part of what he did was this
idea that mechanical energy

4936
03:17:27,971 --> 03:17:31,076
tends to get dissipated as heat that you,

4937
03:17:31,076 --> 03:17:34,630
that you end up going from
sort of systematic mechanical

4938
03:17:34,630 --> 03:17:37,521
motion to this kind of random thing.

4939
03:17:37,522 --> 03:17:38,362
Well, at that time,

4940
03:17:38,361 --> 03:17:40,528
nobody knew what heat was at that time,

4941
03:17:40,529 --> 03:17:43,144
people thought that heat was a fluid,

4942
03:17:43,144 --> 03:17:44,718
like they called it caloric.

4943
03:17:44,718 --> 03:17:46,398
And it was a fluid that kind of,

4944
03:17:46,397 --> 03:17:49,480
kind of was absorbed into substances.

4945
03:17:50,430 --> 03:17:51,391
And when, when heat,

4946
03:17:51,391 --> 03:17:55,637
when one hot thing would
transfer heat to a colder thing,

4947
03:17:55,637 --> 03:17:58,595
that this fluid would
flow from the hot thing

4948
03:17:58,594 --> 03:17:59,835
to the colder thing.

4949
03:17:59,835 --> 03:18:01,034
But anyway, then by the,

4950
03:18:01,034 --> 03:18:06,034
by the 1860s people had kind
of come up with this idea that

4951
03:18:06,293 --> 03:18:09,863
systematic energy tends to degrade

4952
03:18:09,863 --> 03:18:12,863
into kind of random heat that would,

4953
03:18:14,626 --> 03:18:18,130
that that could then not
be easily turned back into

4954
03:18:18,129 --> 03:18:20,375
systematic mechanical energy.

4955
03:18:20,376 --> 03:18:23,880
And then that, that
quickly became sort of a,

4956
03:18:23,879 --> 03:18:26,913
a global principle about how things work.

4957
03:18:26,914 --> 03:18:29,122
Question is, why does it happen that way?

4958
03:18:29,121 --> 03:18:29,954
So, you know,

4959
03:18:29,954 --> 03:18:31,989
let's say you have a bunch
of molecules in a box

4960
03:18:31,989 --> 03:18:33,167
and they're arranged,

4961
03:18:33,167 --> 03:18:36,719
these molecules arranged in a
very nice sort of flotilla of

4962
03:18:36,719 --> 03:18:39,032
molecules in one corner of the box.

4963
03:18:39,032 --> 03:18:42,055
And then what you typically
observe is that after a while

4964
03:18:42,056 --> 03:18:46,256
these molecules were kind of
randomly arranged in the box.

4965
03:18:46,256 --> 03:18:48,307
The question is why does that happen?

4966
03:18:48,308 --> 03:18:49,569
And people for a long,

4967
03:18:49,568 --> 03:18:53,190
long time tried to figure
out is there from the laws of

4968
03:18:53,191 --> 03:18:55,859
mechanics that determine
how these molecules,

4969
03:18:55,859 --> 03:18:57,921
let's say these molecules
like hard spheres bouncing off

4970
03:18:57,921 --> 03:19:00,335
each other from the laws of mechanics

4971
03:19:00,334 --> 03:19:02,013
that describe those molecules.

4972
03:19:02,013 --> 03:19:05,482
Can we explain why it tends
to be the case that we see

4973
03:19:05,483 --> 03:19:10,316
things that are an orderly,
sort of degrade into disorder?

4974
03:19:11,376 --> 03:19:15,350
We tend to see things
that, you know, you you,

4975
03:19:15,350 --> 03:19:19,309
you scramble an egg, you that, you know,

4976
03:19:19,309 --> 03:19:21,382
you take something that's
quite ordered and you,

4977
03:19:21,382 --> 03:19:23,088
you disorder it, so to speak.

4978
03:19:23,088 --> 03:19:25,164
That's a thing that sort of happens

4979
03:19:25,165 --> 03:19:26,461
quite we regularly or you,

4980
03:19:26,460 --> 03:19:28,908
you put some ink into water
and it will eventually spread

4981
03:19:28,908 --> 03:19:32,834
out and, and fill up, you
know, fill up the water,

4982
03:19:32,834 --> 03:19:37,717
but you don't see those little
particles of ink in the water

4983
03:19:37,718 --> 03:19:41,065
all spontaneously kind of arrange
themselves into a big blob

4984
03:19:41,065 --> 03:19:44,195
and then, you know, jump
outta the water or something.

4985
03:19:44,195 --> 03:19:48,121
And so the question is why do
things happen in this kind of

4986
03:19:48,121 --> 03:19:52,139
irreversible way where you
go from order to disorder?

4987
03:19:52,139 --> 03:19:54,380
Why does it happen that way?

4988
03:19:54,380 --> 03:19:55,933
And so throughout,

4989
03:19:55,933 --> 03:19:57,786
in the later part of the 18 hundreds,

4990
03:19:57,787 --> 03:20:00,333
a lot of work was done on
trying to figure out can one

4991
03:20:00,333 --> 03:20:02,381
derive this principle,

4992
03:20:02,380 --> 03:20:05,706
this second law of thermodynamics
this law about the,

4993
03:20:05,706 --> 03:20:08,876
the dynamics of heat, so to speak.

4994
03:20:08,876 --> 03:20:11,310
Come one derive this from,

4995
03:20:11,310 --> 03:20:15,474
from some fundamental principles
of mechanics, you know,

4996
03:20:15,474 --> 03:20:16,831
and the, and the laws of thermodynamics.

4997
03:20:16,831 --> 03:20:18,858
The first law is basically
the law of energy,

4998
03:20:18,858 --> 03:20:22,386
energy conservation that the
total energy associated with

4999
03:20:22,386 --> 03:20:25,817
heat plus the total energy
associated with mechanical kinds

5000
03:20:25,816 --> 03:20:27,809
of things, plus other kinds of energy,

5001
03:20:27,809 --> 03:20:29,789
that that total is constant.

5002
03:20:29,790 --> 03:20:32,367
And that became a pretty
well understood principle.

5003
03:20:32,367 --> 03:20:34,373
But the, the second law of thermodynamics

5004
03:20:34,373 --> 03:20:36,378
was always mysterious.

5005
03:20:36,379 --> 03:20:37,674
Like, why does it work this way?

5006
03:20:37,674 --> 03:20:41,897
Can it be derived from
underlying mechanical laws?

5007
03:20:41,897 --> 03:20:46,122
And so when I was, well,
12 years old actually,

5008
03:20:46,121 --> 03:20:49,083
I had gotten interested, well
I, I'd been interested in,

5009
03:20:49,084 --> 03:20:50,847
in space and things like that.

5010
03:20:50,846 --> 03:20:52,445
Cause I thought that was kind of the,

5011
03:20:52,445 --> 03:20:57,137
the future and interesting
sort of technology and so on.

5012
03:20:57,137 --> 03:20:59,056
And for a while kind of, you know,

5013
03:20:59,056 --> 03:21:02,072
every deep space probe
was sort of a personal

5014
03:21:02,072 --> 03:21:03,162
friend type thing.

5015
03:21:03,162 --> 03:21:04,109
And I knew all, all,

5016
03:21:04,109 --> 03:21:08,271
all kinds of characteristics
of it and was kind of writing

5017
03:21:08,271 --> 03:21:11,295
up all these, all these things
when I was, oh, I don't know,

5018
03:21:11,295 --> 03:21:13,756
eight, nine, ten years old and so on.

5019
03:21:13,756 --> 03:21:14,590
And then I,

5020
03:21:14,590 --> 03:21:16,922
I got interested from being
interested in kind of spacecraft

5021
03:21:16,922 --> 03:21:19,213
I got interested in. So
like how do they work?

5022
03:21:19,213 --> 03:21:21,760
What are all the instruments
on them and so on.

5023
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:23,477
And that got me interested in physics,

5024
03:21:23,477 --> 03:21:25,516
which was just as well because
if I'd stayed interested in

5025
03:21:25,515 --> 03:21:28,590
space in the, you know, mid to late 1960s,

5026
03:21:28,590 --> 03:21:31,790
I would've had a long
wait before, you know,

5027
03:21:31,790 --> 03:21:35,137
space really blossomed
as a, as a, as an area.

5028
03:21:35,138 --> 03:21:36,821
- Timing is everything.

5029
03:21:36,820 --> 03:21:38,498
- Right. I got interest in physics.

5030
03:21:38,498 --> 03:21:43,498
And then, well the actual sort
of detailed story is when I,

5031
03:21:43,995 --> 03:21:48,028
when I kind of graduated from
elementary school at age 12,

5032
03:21:48,029 --> 03:21:50,908
and that's the time when
in England where you finish

5033
03:21:50,908 --> 03:21:55,600
elementary school, I sort
of, my, my gift sort of,

5034
03:21:55,601 --> 03:21:59,836
I suppose more or less for
myself was I got this collection

5035
03:21:59,835 --> 03:22:01,252
of physics books,

5036
03:22:03,388 --> 03:22:05,331
which was some college physics course

5037
03:22:05,332 --> 03:22:07,059
of college physics books.

5038
03:22:07,059 --> 03:22:10,744
And volume five is about
statistical physics and it has this

5039
03:22:10,745 --> 03:22:15,388
picture on the cover that shows
a bunch of kind of idealized

5040
03:22:15,388 --> 03:22:19,230
molecules sitting in one side
of a box and then it has a

5041
03:22:19,229 --> 03:22:22,719
series of frames showing how
these molecules sort of spread

5042
03:22:22,719 --> 03:22:23,858
out in the box.

5043
03:22:23,858 --> 03:22:26,370
And I thought that's pretty
interesting. You know, what,

5044
03:22:26,370 --> 03:22:30,570
what causes that? And you
know, read the book and,

5045
03:22:30,569 --> 03:22:32,248
and the book, the book actually,

5046
03:22:32,248 --> 03:22:34,756
one of the things that was
really significant to me about

5047
03:22:34,756 --> 03:22:36,988
that was the book kind of claimed,

5048
03:22:36,988 --> 03:22:39,834
although I didn't really
understand what it said in detail,

5049
03:22:39,834 --> 03:22:43,118
it kind of claimed that this
sort of principle of physics

5050
03:22:43,119 --> 03:22:45,307
was derivable somehow.

5051
03:22:45,307 --> 03:22:47,369
And you know, other things
I'd learned about physics,

5052
03:22:47,369 --> 03:22:51,977
it was all like, it's a fact
that energy is conserved.

5053
03:22:51,977 --> 03:22:54,856
It's a fact that relativity
works or something not,

5054
03:22:54,856 --> 03:22:59,618
it's something you can derive
from some fundamental sort of,

5055
03:22:59,618 --> 03:23:01,290
it has to be that way as a,

5056
03:23:01,290 --> 03:23:03,784
as a matter of kind of
mathematics or logic or something.

5057
03:23:03,783 --> 03:23:05,869
So it was sort of interesting
to me that there was a thing

5058
03:23:05,870 --> 03:23:08,956
about physics that was kind of
inevitably true and derivable

5059
03:23:08,956 --> 03:23:10,634
so to speak.

5060
03:23:10,634 --> 03:23:11,620
And so I think that,

5061
03:23:11,620 --> 03:23:16,384
so then I was like this
picture on this book and I was

5062
03:23:16,385 --> 03:23:17,681
trying to understand it.

5063
03:23:17,681 --> 03:23:20,478
And so that was actually the
first serious program that I

5064
03:23:20,477 --> 03:23:23,378
wrote for a computer was probably 1973

5065
03:23:23,379 --> 03:23:26,183
written for this computer,

5066
03:23:26,183 --> 03:23:28,886
the size of a desk program
with paper tape and so on.

5067
03:23:28,886 --> 03:23:32,198
And I tried to reproduce this
picture on the book and I

5068
03:23:32,198 --> 03:23:33,940
didn't succeed.

5069
03:23:33,940 --> 03:23:35,667
- What was the failure mode there?

5070
03:23:35,666 --> 03:23:37,547
Like what do you mean you
didn't succeed? So it's a bunch-

5071
03:23:37,548 --> 03:23:39,824
- Looked like, it didn't look like, okay,

5072
03:23:39,824 --> 03:23:41,852
so what happened is, okay,

5073
03:23:41,852 --> 03:23:43,854
many years later I learned how
the picture on the book was

5074
03:23:43,853 --> 03:23:46,842
actually made and that it
was actually kind of a fake,

5075
03:23:46,843 --> 03:23:49,030
but I didn't know that at that time.

5076
03:23:49,030 --> 03:23:51,670
But, and that picture was actually a,

5077
03:23:51,670 --> 03:23:54,128
a very high-tech thing when it was made

5078
03:23:54,128 --> 03:23:55,355
in the beginning of the 1960s,

5079
03:23:55,355 --> 03:23:57,194
was made on the largest supercomputer

5080
03:23:57,194 --> 03:23:58,994
that existed at the time.

5081
03:23:58,995 --> 03:24:02,572
And even so it couldn't quite
simulate the thing that it was

5082
03:24:02,572 --> 03:24:04,682
supposed to be simulating. But anyway,

5083
03:24:04,682 --> 03:24:06,960
I didn't know that until
many, many, many years later.

5084
03:24:06,959 --> 03:24:09,289
So at the time it was like,

5085
03:24:09,290 --> 03:24:11,690
you have these balls
bouncing around in this box,

5086
03:24:11,690 --> 03:24:13,523
but I was using this computer with eight

5087
03:24:13,522 --> 03:24:14,922
kilo words of memory.

5088
03:24:14,923 --> 03:24:16,855
They were 18 bit words of memory words.

5089
03:24:16,854 --> 03:24:21,105
Okay. So it was whatever,
24 kilobytes of memory.

5090
03:24:21,105 --> 03:24:24,200
And it had, you know, it
had these instructions,

5091
03:24:24,200 --> 03:24:27,683
I probably still remember all
of its machine instructions.

5092
03:24:27,683 --> 03:24:30,765
And it didn't really like
dealing with floating point

5093
03:24:30,765 --> 03:24:32,266
numbers or anything like that.

5094
03:24:32,266 --> 03:24:35,156
And so I had to simplify this,
this model of, of, you know,

5095
03:24:35,156 --> 03:24:37,127
particles bouncing around in a box.

5096
03:24:37,128 --> 03:24:37,961
And so I thought,

5097
03:24:37,960 --> 03:24:40,439
well I'll put them on a grid
and I'll make, you know,

5098
03:24:40,440 --> 03:24:43,286
make the things just sort
of move one square at a time

5099
03:24:43,286 --> 03:24:44,532
and so on.

5100
03:24:44,532 --> 03:24:48,335
And so I did the simulation
and the result was,

5101
03:24:48,335 --> 03:24:50,918
it didn't look anything
like the actual pictures

5102
03:24:50,918 --> 03:24:52,485
on the book.

5103
03:24:52,486 --> 03:24:54,862
Now many years later,

5104
03:24:54,861 --> 03:24:58,831
in fact very recently I
realized that the thing I'd

5105
03:24:58,832 --> 03:25:02,047
simulated was actually an
example of a whole sort of

5106
03:25:02,047 --> 03:25:05,623
computational irreducible
story that I absolutely did not

5107
03:25:05,623 --> 03:25:06,921
recognize at the time.

5108
03:25:06,921 --> 03:25:09,056
At the time it just looked like
it did something random and

5109
03:25:09,056 --> 03:25:10,894
it looks wrong.

5110
03:25:10,894 --> 03:25:12,799
As opposed to it did something random.

5111
03:25:12,799 --> 03:25:14,760
And it's super interesting
that it's random,

5112
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:17,605
but I didn't recognize that at the time.

5113
03:25:17,605 --> 03:25:19,594
And so as it was at the time, I kind of,

5114
03:25:19,594 --> 03:25:22,063
I got interested in particle
physics and I got interested

5115
03:25:22,064 --> 03:25:25,394
in, in other kinds of physics and,

5116
03:25:25,394 --> 03:25:27,396
but this whole second
of thermodynamics thing,

5117
03:25:27,396 --> 03:25:29,817
this idea that sort of orderly things

5118
03:25:29,816 --> 03:25:31,690
tend to degrade into disorder,

5119
03:25:31,691 --> 03:25:34,091
continued to be something
I was really interested in.

5120
03:25:34,091 --> 03:25:36,347
And I was really curious
for the whole universe,

5121
03:25:36,347 --> 03:25:39,117
why doesn't that happen all the time?

5122
03:25:39,117 --> 03:25:40,931
Like we start off at the,

5123
03:25:40,931 --> 03:25:42,934
in the big bang at the beginning
of the universe was this

5124
03:25:42,933 --> 03:25:45,608
thing that seems like it's
this very disordered collection

5125
03:25:45,609 --> 03:25:49,436
of, of stuff and then it
spontaneously forms itself into

5126
03:25:49,436 --> 03:25:53,316
galaxies and creates
all of this complexity

5127
03:25:53,316 --> 03:25:55,057
and order in the universe.

5128
03:25:55,058 --> 03:25:57,782
And so I was very curious
how that happens and I,

5129
03:25:57,781 --> 03:26:00,825
but I was always kind of
thinking this is kind of somehow

5130
03:26:00,825 --> 03:26:03,601
the second order of
thermodynamics is behind it,

5131
03:26:03,602 --> 03:26:06,504
trying to sort of pull
things back into disorder

5132
03:26:06,504 --> 03:26:07,740
so to speak.

5133
03:26:07,739 --> 03:26:10,379
And how was order being created.

5134
03:26:10,379 --> 03:26:12,170
And so actually I was, was interested,

5135
03:26:12,170 --> 03:26:16,465
this is probably now 1980, I
got interested in kind of this,

5136
03:26:16,465 --> 03:26:19,617
you know, galaxy formation
and so on in the universe.

5137
03:26:19,617 --> 03:26:21,936
I also at that time was interested
in neural networks and I

5138
03:26:21,936 --> 03:26:24,280
was interested in kind of how,

5139
03:26:24,281 --> 03:26:28,370
how brains make complicated
things happen and so on.

5140
03:26:28,370 --> 03:26:29,439
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

5141
03:26:29,439 --> 03:26:31,226
What's the connection between
the formation of galaxies and

5142
03:26:31,226 --> 03:26:33,828
how brains make complicated things happen?

5143
03:26:33,827 --> 03:26:34,993
- Because they're both a matter of how

5144
03:26:34,994 --> 03:26:37,331
complicated things come to happen.

5145
03:26:37,331 --> 03:26:39,108
- From simple origins?

5146
03:26:39,108 --> 03:26:42,218
- [Wolfram] Yeah. From
some sort of known origins.

5147
03:26:42,218 --> 03:26:43,597
I had the sense that,

5148
03:26:43,596 --> 03:26:46,693
that what I was interested in was kind of

5149
03:26:46,693 --> 03:26:47,870
in all these different,

5150
03:26:47,870 --> 03:26:51,576
this sort of different cases
of where complicated things

5151
03:26:51,576 --> 03:26:54,206
were arising from rules.

5152
03:26:54,207 --> 03:26:55,040
And you know,

5153
03:26:55,040 --> 03:26:57,160
I also looked at snowflakes
and things like that.

5154
03:26:57,159 --> 03:27:00,506
I was curious and, and
Floyd Dynamics in general.

5155
03:27:00,506 --> 03:27:03,613
I was just sort of curious
about how does complexity arise

5156
03:27:03,613 --> 03:27:06,759
and, and the, the thing
that I didn't, you know,

5157
03:27:06,759 --> 03:27:10,273
it took me a while to kind of
realize that there might be a

5158
03:27:10,273 --> 03:27:11,530
general phenomenon.

5159
03:27:11,531 --> 03:27:12,659
You know, I sort of assumed,

5160
03:27:12,658 --> 03:27:15,496
oh there's galaxies over here,
there's brains over here.

5161
03:27:15,496 --> 03:27:17,827
They're, they're very
different kinds of things.

5162
03:27:17,827 --> 03:27:20,698
And so what happened, this
is probably 1981 or so,

5163
03:27:20,698 --> 03:27:21,753
I decided okay, I'm,

5164
03:27:21,753 --> 03:27:24,086
I'm gonna try and make the minimal model

5165
03:27:24,085 --> 03:27:26,168
of how these things work.

5166
03:27:27,016 --> 03:27:29,371
And it was sort of an interesting
experience because I had

5167
03:27:29,371 --> 03:27:31,565
built, starting in 1979,

5168
03:27:31,566 --> 03:27:33,907
I built my first big computer system.

5169
03:27:33,906 --> 03:27:36,881
It's a thing called SMP
symbolic manipulation program.

5170
03:27:36,881 --> 03:27:39,269
It's kind of a forerunner of
modern Wolfram language with

5171
03:27:39,269 --> 03:27:42,665
many of the same ideas about
symbolic computation and so on.

5172
03:27:42,665 --> 03:27:46,280
But the thing that was very
important to me about that was,

5173
03:27:46,280 --> 03:27:48,042
you know, in building that language,

5174
03:27:48,041 --> 03:27:50,957
I had basically tried to figure
out what were the sort of,

5175
03:27:50,957 --> 03:27:53,359
what were the relevant
computational primitives,

5176
03:27:53,359 --> 03:27:56,202
which have turned out to stay with me

5177
03:27:56,201 --> 03:27:58,163
for the last 40 something years.

5178
03:27:58,164 --> 03:28:02,073
But it was also important because
in building a language was

5179
03:28:02,073 --> 03:28:03,882
very different activity
from natural science,

5180
03:28:03,882 --> 03:28:05,557
which is what I'd mostly done before.

5181
03:28:05,557 --> 03:28:06,390
Cause in natural science you start from

5182
03:28:06,389 --> 03:28:08,047
the phenomenon of the

5183
03:28:08,048 --> 03:28:10,025
world and you try and figure out,

5184
03:28:10,025 --> 03:28:12,898
so how can I make sense of
the phenomena of the world?

5185
03:28:12,898 --> 03:28:13,926
And you know,

5186
03:28:13,926 --> 03:28:17,106
kind of the world presents
you with what it has to offer,

5187
03:28:17,106 --> 03:28:17,940
so to speak.

5188
03:28:17,940 --> 03:28:22,691
And you have to make sense
of it when you build a com,

5189
03:28:22,691 --> 03:28:24,397
you know, computer language or something,

5190
03:28:24,397 --> 03:28:27,051
you are creating your own
primitives and then you say can,

5191
03:28:27,050 --> 03:28:29,772
so what can you make from
these, sort of the opposite way

5192
03:28:29,772 --> 03:28:32,197
round from what you do in natural science.

5193
03:28:32,198 --> 03:28:33,487
But I'd had the experience of doing that

5194
03:28:33,486 --> 03:28:35,022
and so I was kind of like, okay,

5195
03:28:35,022 --> 03:28:38,101
what happens if you sort of
make an artificial physics?

5196
03:28:38,102 --> 03:28:40,063
What happens if you just make up the rules

5197
03:28:40,063 --> 03:28:42,174
by which systems operate?

5198
03:28:42,174 --> 03:28:43,469
And then I was thinking, you know,

5199
03:28:43,468 --> 03:28:44,632
for all these different systems,

5200
03:28:44,632 --> 03:28:46,924
whether it was galaxies
or brains or whatever,

5201
03:28:46,924 --> 03:28:50,034
what's the absolutely minimal
model that kind of captures

5202
03:28:50,034 --> 03:28:53,368
the things that are important
about those systems.

5203
03:28:53,368 --> 03:28:55,047
- The computational
perimeters of that system.

5204
03:28:55,047 --> 03:28:56,067
- Yes.

5205
03:28:56,066 --> 03:28:59,776
And so that's what ended up
with the cellular autor where

5206
03:28:59,777 --> 03:29:01,960
you just have a line of
black and white cells,

5207
03:29:01,960 --> 03:29:03,712
you just have a rule that says, you know,

5208
03:29:03,712 --> 03:29:05,813
given the cell in its neighbors,

5209
03:29:05,813 --> 03:29:07,923
what will the color of the cell
be on the next step when you

5210
03:29:07,923 --> 03:29:09,954
just run it in a series of steps?

5211
03:29:09,953 --> 03:29:10,985
And the sort of,

5212
03:29:10,985 --> 03:29:14,583
the ironic thing is that cellular
autor are great models for

5213
03:29:14,583 --> 03:29:15,774
many kinds of things,

5214
03:29:15,773 --> 03:29:20,773
but galaxies and brains are two
examples where they do very,

5215
03:29:20,775 --> 03:29:23,548
very badly. They're really
irrelevant to those two cases.

5216
03:29:23,548 --> 03:29:25,885
- Is there a connection to the
second law thermodynamics and

5217
03:29:25,885 --> 03:29:26,978
cellular auto automata?

5218
03:29:26,978 --> 03:29:27,867
- Oh yes.

5219
03:29:27,867 --> 03:29:28,827
- The things you,

5220
03:29:28,827 --> 03:29:30,939
the things you've discovered
about cellular auto automata.

5221
03:29:30,939 --> 03:29:31,994
- Yes. Okay.

5222
03:29:31,994 --> 03:29:34,011
So when I first started
cell cellular Automata,

5223
03:29:34,011 --> 03:29:36,637
my first papers about them were, you know,

5224
03:29:36,637 --> 03:29:38,570
the first sentence was always
about the second row of

5225
03:29:38,569 --> 03:29:42,735
thermodynamics was always
about how does order

5226
03:29:42,736 --> 03:29:43,697
manage to be produced,

5227
03:29:43,697 --> 03:29:45,507
even though there's a second
row of thermodynamics,

5228
03:29:45,507 --> 03:29:47,859
which tries to pull
things back into disorder.

5229
03:29:47,859 --> 03:29:48,762
And I kind of,

5230
03:29:48,762 --> 03:29:51,927
my early understanding of
that had to do with these are

5231
03:29:51,927 --> 03:29:55,852
intrinsically irreversible
processes in cellular automata

5232
03:29:55,852 --> 03:29:58,335
that that form, you know,

5233
03:29:58,335 --> 03:29:59,823
conform orderly structures

5234
03:29:59,824 --> 03:30:01,781
even from random initial conditions.

5235
03:30:01,781 --> 03:30:03,470
But then what I realized this was,

5236
03:30:03,469 --> 03:30:04,902
well actually it's,

5237
03:30:04,902 --> 03:30:08,105
it's one of these things
where it was a discovery

5238
03:30:08,105 --> 03:30:10,527
that I should have made
earlier but didn't.

5239
03:30:10,527 --> 03:30:13,131
So, you know, I had, I had been
studying cellular automata.

5240
03:30:13,131 --> 03:30:16,430
What I did was the sort of most
obvious computer experiment.

5241
03:30:16,430 --> 03:30:19,109
You just try all the different
rules and see what they do.

5242
03:30:19,109 --> 03:30:20,331
It's kind of like, you know,

5243
03:30:20,331 --> 03:30:22,156
you've invented a computational telescope,

5244
03:30:22,156 --> 03:30:24,438
you just pointed at the most
obvious thing in the sky,

5245
03:30:24,438 --> 03:30:26,784
and then you just see what's there.

5246
03:30:26,784 --> 03:30:27,854
And so I did that and I,

5247
03:30:27,854 --> 03:30:29,522
you know, was making
all these pictures of,

5248
03:30:29,522 --> 03:30:31,358
of how cellular automata work.

5249
03:30:31,359 --> 03:30:34,203
And I studied these pictures.
I studied in great detail.

5250
03:30:34,203 --> 03:30:37,217
There was, you can number the
rules for cellular automata.

5251
03:30:37,217 --> 03:30:39,638
And one of them is, you know, rule 30.

5252
03:30:39,638 --> 03:30:43,396
So I made a picture of
Rule 30 back in 1981 or so,

5253
03:30:43,396 --> 03:30:44,396
and Rule 30,

5254
03:30:45,504 --> 03:30:48,698
well, it's, and I, and I at the
time, I was just like, okay,

5255
03:30:48,698 --> 03:30:50,379
it's another one of these
rules. I don't really,

5256
03:30:50,379 --> 03:30:53,027
it happens to be asymmetric
left, right asymmetric.

5257
03:30:53,027 --> 03:30:54,123
And it's like,

5258
03:30:54,123 --> 03:30:56,735
let me just consider the case
of the symmetric ones just to

5259
03:30:56,736 --> 03:30:59,327
keep things simpler, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

5260
03:30:59,326 --> 03:31:00,780
And I just kind of ignored it.

5261
03:31:00,781 --> 03:31:05,471
And then sort of in, in, actually
in 1984, strangely enough,

5262
03:31:05,470 --> 03:31:09,802
I, I ended up having a,
an early laser printer,

5263
03:31:09,802 --> 03:31:12,615
which made very high resolution pictures.

5264
03:31:12,615 --> 03:31:13,449
And I thought,

5265
03:31:13,449 --> 03:31:14,832
I'm gonna print out an
interesting, you know,

5266
03:31:14,832 --> 03:31:16,154
I wanna make an interesting picture.

5267
03:31:16,154 --> 03:31:18,709
Let me take this rule 30
thing and just make a high

5268
03:31:18,709 --> 03:31:20,750
resolution picture of it. And I did.

5269
03:31:20,750 --> 03:31:21,583
And it's,

5270
03:31:21,583 --> 03:31:23,808
it has this very remarkable
property that its rule is very

5271
03:31:23,808 --> 03:31:24,755
simple.

5272
03:31:24,754 --> 03:31:27,817
You started off just from one
black cell at the top and it

5273
03:31:27,817 --> 03:31:30,084
makes this kind of triangular pattern.

5274
03:31:30,084 --> 03:31:33,813
But if you look inside this
pattern, it looks really random.

5275
03:31:33,814 --> 03:31:34,726
There's, you know,

5276
03:31:34,726 --> 03:31:37,646
you look at the center column
of cells and, you know,

5277
03:31:37,646 --> 03:31:39,829
I studied that in great detail and it's,

5278
03:31:39,829 --> 03:31:42,420
so far as one can tell,
it's completely random.

5279
03:31:42,420 --> 03:31:45,253
And it's kind of a little
bit like digits of pie.

5280
03:31:45,253 --> 03:31:46,818
Once you, you know,

5281
03:31:46,817 --> 03:31:48,275
you know the rule for
generating the digits of pie,

5282
03:31:48,275 --> 03:31:51,099
but once you've generated
them, you know, 3.14159,

5283
03:31:51,099 --> 03:31:53,788
et cetera, they seem completely random.

5284
03:31:53,788 --> 03:31:56,787
And in fact, I, I put up this
prize back in, what was it,

5285
03:31:56,787 --> 03:31:58,304
2019 or something for,

5286
03:31:58,304 --> 03:32:01,451
prove anything about
the sequence, basically.

5287
03:32:01,451 --> 03:32:03,238
- [Fridman] Has anyone been
able to do anything on that?

5288
03:32:03,238 --> 03:32:06,453
- People have sent me some
things, but it's, you know,

5289
03:32:06,453 --> 03:32:08,961
I don't know how hard these problems are.

5290
03:32:08,961 --> 03:32:11,395
I mean, I, I was kind of
spoiled cause I, 2007,

5291
03:32:11,396 --> 03:32:15,297
I put up a prize for
determining whether a particular

5292
03:32:15,297 --> 03:32:18,693
touring machine that I thought
was the simplest candidate

5293
03:32:18,692 --> 03:32:21,729
for being a universal touring
machine determine whether it

5294
03:32:21,729 --> 03:32:23,899
is or isn't a universal touring machine.

5295
03:32:23,899 --> 03:32:26,167
And somebody did a really good job of,

5296
03:32:26,167 --> 03:32:27,885
of winning that prize and
proving that it was a universal

5297
03:32:27,885 --> 03:32:30,078
touring machine in about six months.

5298
03:32:30,078 --> 03:32:31,315
And so I, you know,

5299
03:32:31,315 --> 03:32:33,140
I didn't know whether that
would be one of these problems

5300
03:32:33,139 --> 03:32:34,808
that was out there for hundreds of years,

5301
03:32:34,808 --> 03:32:36,595
or whether in this particular case,

5302
03:32:36,595 --> 03:32:39,225
young chap called Alex Smith, you know,

5303
03:32:39,225 --> 03:32:40,904
nailed it in six months.

5304
03:32:40,904 --> 03:32:43,015
And so with this little 30 formulation,

5305
03:32:43,014 --> 03:32:45,751
I don't really know whether
these are things that are a

5306
03:32:45,752 --> 03:32:48,236
hundred years away from
being able to, to get,

5307
03:32:48,236 --> 03:32:49,929
or whether somebody's gonna come and

5308
03:32:49,929 --> 03:32:51,105
do something very clever.

5309
03:32:51,105 --> 03:32:53,314
- It's such a, I mean,
it's like for (indistinct),

5310
03:32:53,314 --> 03:32:57,246
it's such a rule 30, it's
such a simple formulation.

5311
03:32:57,245 --> 03:33:01,359
It feels like anyone can
look at it and understand it.

5312
03:33:01,360 --> 03:33:04,676
And feel like it's within
grasp to be able to predict

5313
03:33:04,675 --> 03:33:08,621
something to do to, to
direct some kind of law

5314
03:33:08,621 --> 03:33:11,310
that allows you to predict
something about this.

5315
03:33:11,310 --> 03:33:13,556
Middle column of rule 30.

5316
03:33:13,557 --> 03:33:15,195
- [Wolfram] Right. But you
know, this is, this is-

5317
03:33:15,195 --> 03:33:16,658
- Yet you can't.

5318
03:33:16,658 --> 03:33:17,492
- Yeah, right.

5319
03:33:17,492 --> 03:33:21,316
This is the intuition surprise
of computational reducibility

5320
03:33:21,316 --> 03:33:22,959
and so on, that even though
the rules are simple,

5321
03:33:22,959 --> 03:33:25,240
you can't tell what's going
to happen and you can't prove

5322
03:33:25,240 --> 03:33:27,148
things about it.

5323
03:33:27,148 --> 03:33:28,154
And I think so.

5324
03:33:28,155 --> 03:33:30,726
So anyway, the, the, the, the thing I,

5325
03:33:30,726 --> 03:33:32,693
I sort of started in 1984 or so,

5326
03:33:32,692 --> 03:33:35,667
I started realizing there's
this phenomenon that you can

5327
03:33:35,667 --> 03:33:36,869
have very simple rules.

5328
03:33:36,870 --> 03:33:38,668
They produce apparently random behavior.

5329
03:33:38,667 --> 03:33:39,501
Okay.

5330
03:33:39,501 --> 03:33:40,334
So that's a little bit like the second

5331
03:33:40,334 --> 03:33:42,052
neuro dynamics because

5332
03:33:42,051 --> 03:33:46,180
it's like you have this simple
initial condition, you can,

5333
03:33:46,180 --> 03:33:48,938
you know, readily see
that it's very, you know,

5334
03:33:48,938 --> 03:33:50,810
you can describe it very easily.

5335
03:33:50,810 --> 03:33:55,370
And yet it makes this thing
that seems to be random.

5336
03:33:55,370 --> 03:33:58,932
Now, turns out there's
some technical detail

5337
03:33:58,933 --> 03:34:00,604
about the second thermodynamics

5338
03:34:00,603 --> 03:34:02,390
and about the idea of reversibility.

5339
03:34:02,390 --> 03:34:05,798
When you have a, if you
have kind of a, a, a, a,

5340
03:34:05,799 --> 03:34:07,849
a movie of two, you know,

5341
03:34:07,849 --> 03:34:10,944
billiard balls colliding and
you see them collide and they

5342
03:34:10,944 --> 03:34:13,683
bounce off, and you run
that movie in reverse,

5343
03:34:13,683 --> 03:34:16,601
you can't tell which way was
the forward direction of time

5344
03:34:16,602 --> 03:34:18,775
and which way was the
backward direction of time.

5345
03:34:18,774 --> 03:34:20,871
When you're just looking at
individual billard balls,

5346
03:34:20,871 --> 03:34:23,354
by the time you've got a whole
collection of them, you know,

5347
03:34:23,354 --> 03:34:25,503
a million of them or something,

5348
03:34:25,504 --> 03:34:28,263
then it turns out to be the case.

5349
03:34:28,263 --> 03:34:29,294
And this is the, the sort of the,

5350
03:34:29,293 --> 03:34:30,971
the mystery of the second law.

5351
03:34:30,971 --> 03:34:32,988
That the orderly thing,

5352
03:34:32,988 --> 03:34:35,650
you start with the orderly
thing and it becomes disordered.

5353
03:34:35,650 --> 03:34:38,520
And that's the forward direction in time.

5354
03:34:38,520 --> 03:34:41,640
And the other way round
of it starts disordered

5355
03:34:41,640 --> 03:34:42,601
and becomes ordered.

5356
03:34:42,602 --> 03:34:44,483
You just don't see that in the world.

5357
03:34:44,483 --> 03:34:47,353
Now, in principle, if you, you know,

5358
03:34:47,352 --> 03:34:51,215
if you sort of traced the
detailed motions of all those

5359
03:34:51,216 --> 03:34:54,563
molecules backwards, you
would be able to, it, it will,

5360
03:34:54,563 --> 03:34:58,826
it will. The reverse of time
makes, you know, as you,

5361
03:34:58,825 --> 03:35:01,152
as you go forwards in time,
order goes to disorder,

5362
03:35:01,153 --> 03:35:02,243
as you go backwards in time,

5363
03:35:02,243 --> 03:35:03,603
order goes to disorder.

5364
03:35:03,602 --> 03:35:04,777
- [Fridman] Perfectly. So yes.

5365
03:35:04,777 --> 03:35:09,777
- Right. So the, the mystery
is why is it the case that,

5366
03:35:10,127 --> 03:35:12,971
or one version of the mystery
is why is it the case that you

5367
03:35:12,971 --> 03:35:16,068
never see something which
happens to be just the kind of

5368
03:35:16,068 --> 03:35:19,631
disorder that you would need
to somehow evolve to order.

5369
03:35:19,631 --> 03:35:21,565
Why does that not happen?

5370
03:35:21,565 --> 03:35:24,550
Why do you always just see
order goes to disorder not the

5371
03:35:24,549 --> 03:35:26,520
other way around?

5372
03:35:26,521 --> 03:35:28,691
So the thing that I, I kind of realized,

5373
03:35:28,691 --> 03:35:31,537
I started realizing in the
1980s, it's kind of like,

5374
03:35:31,537 --> 03:35:33,827
it's a bit like cryptography.

5375
03:35:33,827 --> 03:35:35,868
It's kind of like you start off from this,

5376
03:35:35,869 --> 03:35:37,561
this key that's pretty simple,

5377
03:35:37,561 --> 03:35:40,978
and then you kind of run it
and you can get this, you know,

5378
03:35:40,978 --> 03:35:43,371
complicated random mess.

5379
03:35:43,371 --> 03:35:45,788
And the thing that that well,

5380
03:35:47,520 --> 03:35:52,520
I sort of started realizing
back then was that the second

5381
03:35:52,849 --> 03:35:57,230
law is kind of a, a, a story
of computational reducibility.

5382
03:35:57,230 --> 03:36:00,817
It's a story of, you know,
what seems, you know, what,

5383
03:36:00,817 --> 03:36:03,325
what we can describe
easily at the beginning,

5384
03:36:03,325 --> 03:36:07,375
we can only describe with a
lot of computational effort

5385
03:36:07,375 --> 03:36:09,054
at the end.

5386
03:36:09,054 --> 03:36:11,899
Okay. So now we come
many, many years later,

5387
03:36:11,899 --> 03:36:14,733
and I was trying to sort of, well,

5388
03:36:16,486 --> 03:36:20,279
having done this big project
to understand fundamental

5389
03:36:20,280 --> 03:36:24,849
physics, I realized that sort
of a key aspect of that is

5390
03:36:24,849 --> 03:36:27,886
understanding what observers are like.

5391
03:36:27,886 --> 03:36:32,445
And then I realized that the
second auto neuro dynamics is

5392
03:36:32,445 --> 03:36:35,262
the same story as a bunch
of these other cases.

5393
03:36:35,263 --> 03:36:36,846
It is a story of a,

5394
03:36:37,977 --> 03:36:41,770
a computationally bounded
observer trying to observe a

5395
03:36:41,770 --> 03:36:44,567
computationally irreducible system.

5396
03:36:44,566 --> 03:36:46,843
So it's a story of, you know,

5397
03:36:46,843 --> 03:36:49,222
underneath the molecules
are bouncing around,

5398
03:36:49,222 --> 03:36:53,013
they're bouncing around in
this completely determined way,

5399
03:36:53,013 --> 03:36:54,695
determined by rules.

5400
03:36:54,694 --> 03:36:56,958
But the point is that,

5401
03:36:56,959 --> 03:37:00,775
that we as computationally
bounded observers,

5402
03:37:00,775 --> 03:37:04,583
can't tell that there were
these sort of simple underlying

5403
03:37:04,583 --> 03:37:07,529
rules to us that just looks random.

5404
03:37:07,529 --> 03:37:09,722
And when it comes to this
question about can you prepare the

5405
03:37:09,722 --> 03:37:12,389
initial state so that, you know,

5406
03:37:13,325 --> 03:37:16,121
the disordered thing is, you know,

5407
03:37:16,120 --> 03:37:18,173
you have exactly the right
disorder to make something

5408
03:37:18,174 --> 03:37:21,906
orderly, A computationally
bounded observer cannot do that.

5409
03:37:21,906 --> 03:37:24,774
We'd have to have done all
of this sort of irreducible

5410
03:37:24,773 --> 03:37:27,424
computation to work out very precisely

5411
03:37:27,424 --> 03:37:29,238
what this disordered state,

5412
03:37:29,238 --> 03:37:32,704
what the exact right disordered
state is so that we would

5413
03:37:32,704 --> 03:37:35,487
get this ordered thing produced from it.

5414
03:37:35,487 --> 03:37:39,438
- What does it mean to be
computationally bounded observer?

5415
03:37:39,438 --> 03:37:41,871
So observing a computation
reducible system,

5416
03:37:41,871 --> 03:37:43,275
so the computationally bounded,

5417
03:37:43,275 --> 03:37:45,965
is there something
formal you can say there?

5418
03:37:45,965 --> 03:37:49,318
- Right. So it means, okay, you can,

5419
03:37:49,318 --> 03:37:50,457
you can talk about Turing machines,

5420
03:37:50,458 --> 03:37:53,878
you can talk about computational
complexity theory and you

5421
03:37:53,878 --> 03:37:58,152
know, polynomial time
computation and things like this.

5422
03:37:58,152 --> 03:38:01,067
There are a variety of ways to
make something more precise,

5423
03:38:01,066 --> 03:38:02,156
but I think it's more useful,

5424
03:38:02,156 --> 03:38:04,486
the intuitive version
of it is more useful.

5425
03:38:04,486 --> 03:38:07,809
Which is basically just
to say that, you know,

5426
03:38:07,809 --> 03:38:10,292
how much computation are you going to do

5427
03:38:10,292 --> 03:38:12,599
to try and work out what's going on?

5428
03:38:12,599 --> 03:38:13,484
And the answer is,

5429
03:38:13,484 --> 03:38:15,584
you're not allowed to do a lot of,

5430
03:38:15,584 --> 03:38:18,155
we are not able to do a
lot of computation when we,

5431
03:38:18,155 --> 03:38:20,171
you know, we've got, you know,

5432
03:38:20,171 --> 03:38:23,371
in this room there will
be a trillion, trillion,

5433
03:38:23,371 --> 03:38:25,054
trillion molecules. Yeah.

5434
03:38:25,054 --> 03:38:25,887
A little bit less.

5435
03:38:25,887 --> 03:38:27,576
- It's a big room.

5436
03:38:27,575 --> 03:38:28,408
- Right.

5437
03:38:28,408 --> 03:38:31,895
And you know, at every moment, you know,

5438
03:38:31,895 --> 03:38:34,354
there every microsecond or
something, these molecules,

5439
03:38:34,353 --> 03:38:36,029
molecules are colliding.

5440
03:38:36,030 --> 03:38:39,934
And that's a lot of computation
that's getting done.

5441
03:38:39,933 --> 03:38:41,960
And the question is, in our brains,

5442
03:38:41,960 --> 03:38:45,307
we do a lot less computation every second,

5443
03:38:45,308 --> 03:38:48,178
then the computation done
by all those molecules.

5444
03:38:48,177 --> 03:38:51,200
If there is computational
irr, reducibility,

5445
03:38:51,200 --> 03:38:54,248
we can't work out in detail
what all those molecules

5446
03:38:54,248 --> 03:38:55,914
are going to do.

5447
03:38:55,914 --> 03:38:59,372
What we can do is only a much
smaller amount of computation.

5448
03:38:59,371 --> 03:39:00,204
And so the,

5449
03:39:00,204 --> 03:39:04,245
the second thermodynamics is
this kind of interplay between

5450
03:39:04,245 --> 03:39:07,307
the underlying computational
irreducibility,

5451
03:39:07,307 --> 03:39:10,810
and the fact that we as
preparers of initial states or as

5452
03:39:10,809 --> 03:39:14,059
measures of what happens
are, you know, are,

5453
03:39:14,059 --> 03:39:16,439
are not capable of doing
that much computation.

5454
03:39:16,439 --> 03:39:20,291
So to us, another big formulation
of the second order of

5455
03:39:20,290 --> 03:39:23,735
thermodynamics is this idea of
the law of entropy increase.

5456
03:39:23,736 --> 03:39:25,993
- The characteristic that this universe,

5457
03:39:25,993 --> 03:39:28,549
the entropy seems to be always increasing.

5458
03:39:28,549 --> 03:39:30,225
What does that show to you
about the evolution of-

5459
03:39:30,225 --> 03:39:32,388
- Well, okay, so, so-

5460
03:39:32,388 --> 03:39:34,518
- [Fridman] The universe of time.

5461
03:39:34,518 --> 03:39:36,470
- The History of entropy is yes, okay.

5462
03:39:36,470 --> 03:39:40,173
And that's very confused in
the history of thermodynamics,

5463
03:39:40,174 --> 03:39:41,868
because entropy was
first introduced by a guy

5464
03:39:41,868 --> 03:39:43,368
called Rudolph Klauseous,

5465
03:39:43,368 --> 03:39:47,077
and he did it in terms
of heat and temperature.

5466
03:39:47,077 --> 03:39:48,345
Okay. Subsequently,

5467
03:39:48,345 --> 03:39:51,106
it was reformulated by a
guy called Ludwig Boltzmann.

5468
03:39:51,106 --> 03:39:54,023
And he formulated it in a much more

5469
03:39:55,815 --> 03:39:58,297
kind of commonatorial type way.

5470
03:39:58,297 --> 03:40:00,572
But he always claimed that
it was equivalent to Klaus's

5471
03:40:00,572 --> 03:40:04,979
thing. And in, in one particular
simple example, it is,

5472
03:40:04,979 --> 03:40:07,801
but that connection between
these two formulations of

5473
03:40:07,801 --> 03:40:10,609
entropy, they've never been connected.

5474
03:40:10,609 --> 03:40:11,807
I mean, it's there.

5475
03:40:11,807 --> 03:40:12,908
There's really, so, okay,

5476
03:40:12,907 --> 03:40:15,432
so the more general definition
of entropy due to Boltzmann

5477
03:40:15,433 --> 03:40:17,627
is, is the following thing.

5478
03:40:17,627 --> 03:40:18,460
So you say,

5479
03:40:18,459 --> 03:40:21,360
I have a system and has many
possible configurations.

5480
03:40:21,361 --> 03:40:23,712
Molecules can be in many
different arrangements, et cetera,

5481
03:40:23,711 --> 03:40:24,895
et cetera, et cetera.

5482
03:40:24,896 --> 03:40:27,867
If we know something about
the system, for example,

5483
03:40:27,867 --> 03:40:30,984
we know it's in a box, it
has a certain pressure,

5484
03:40:30,984 --> 03:40:32,122
it has a certain temperature,

5485
03:40:32,122 --> 03:40:34,944
we know these overall facts
about it, then we say,

5486
03:40:34,944 --> 03:40:38,172
how many microscopic
configurations of the system are

5487
03:40:38,173 --> 03:40:41,451
possible given those overall constraints.

5488
03:40:41,450 --> 03:40:45,828
And the entropy is the
log rhythm of that number.

5489
03:40:45,828 --> 03:40:47,507
That's the definition.

5490
03:40:47,507 --> 03:40:50,555
And that's the kind of the
general definition of entropy

5491
03:40:50,555 --> 03:40:52,238
that, that turns out to be useful.

5492
03:40:52,237 --> 03:40:53,424
Now, in Boltzmann's time,

5493
03:40:53,424 --> 03:40:55,751
he thought these molecules could be placed

5494
03:40:55,752 --> 03:40:56,915
anywhere you want.

5495
03:40:56,915 --> 03:40:59,388
He didn't think and, but he said, oh,

5496
03:40:59,388 --> 03:41:01,910
actually we can make it a
lot simpler by having the

5497
03:41:01,909 --> 03:41:04,021
molecules be discreet.

5498
03:41:04,021 --> 03:41:06,504
Well, actually he didn't
know molecules existed right?

5499
03:41:06,504 --> 03:41:09,231
In, in those, in his
time, 1860s and so on.

5500
03:41:09,230 --> 03:41:13,810
The idea that matter might
made of discrete stuff had been

5501
03:41:13,810 --> 03:41:16,967
floated ever since ancient Greek times.

5502
03:41:16,967 --> 03:41:19,753
But it had been a long time
debate about, you know,

5503
03:41:19,753 --> 03:41:22,707
is matter discreet as a
continuous at the moment of,

5504
03:41:22,707 --> 03:41:24,145
at that time,

5505
03:41:24,145 --> 03:41:28,238
people mostly thought that
matter was continuous.

5506
03:41:28,237 --> 03:41:31,260
And it was all confused with
this question about what heat

5507
03:41:31,261 --> 03:41:35,545
is, and people thought heat
was this fluid, and it was,

5508
03:41:35,545 --> 03:41:37,221
it was a big, big muddle.

5509
03:41:37,221 --> 03:41:40,441
And the, and this, but Boltzmann said,

5510
03:41:40,441 --> 03:41:42,730
let's assume they're discreet molecules.

5511
03:41:42,730 --> 03:41:45,360
Let's even assume they have
discreet energy levels.

5512
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:47,328
Let's say everything is discreet,

5513
03:41:47,327 --> 03:41:50,507
then we can do sort of
combinatorial mathematics and work

5514
03:41:50,507 --> 03:41:52,466
out how many configurations
of these things

5515
03:41:52,466 --> 03:41:53,971
there will be in the box.

5516
03:41:53,971 --> 03:41:57,057
And we can say, we can
compute this entropy quantity.

5517
03:41:57,058 --> 03:41:58,148
But he said,

5518
03:41:58,147 --> 03:41:59,730
but of course it's just a fiction

5519
03:41:59,730 --> 03:42:01,023
that these things are discreet.

5520
03:42:01,023 --> 03:42:02,102
So he said,

5521
03:42:02,102 --> 03:42:03,889
this is an interesting
piece of history by the way,

5522
03:42:03,889 --> 03:42:05,739
that that, that, you know, that was,

5523
03:42:05,739 --> 03:42:08,414
at that time people didn't
know molecules existed.

5524
03:42:08,415 --> 03:42:09,783
There were other hints from,

5525
03:42:09,782 --> 03:42:13,046
from looking at kind of
chemistry that there might be

5526
03:42:13,047 --> 03:42:15,349
discreet atoms and so on, just from the,

5527
03:42:15,349 --> 03:42:17,056
the combinatorics of, you know,

5528
03:42:17,056 --> 03:42:20,452
two hydrogens and one oxygen
make water, you know, two,

5529
03:42:20,451 --> 03:42:23,750
two amounts of hydrogen plus
one amount of oxygen together

5530
03:42:23,750 --> 03:42:26,006
make water, things like this.

5531
03:42:26,006 --> 03:42:28,867
But it wasn't known that
discrete molecules existed.

5532
03:42:28,867 --> 03:42:31,700
And in fact, the people, you know,

5533
03:42:32,911 --> 03:42:36,184
it wasn't until the beginning of the,

5534
03:42:36,184 --> 03:42:39,593
of the 20th century that
brownie in motion was the final

5535
03:42:39,593 --> 03:42:41,415
giveaway. Brown in motion is, you know,

5536
03:42:41,415 --> 03:42:43,096
you look under a microscope
of these little pieces from

5537
03:42:43,096 --> 03:42:44,766
pollen grains,

5538
03:42:44,766 --> 03:42:47,825
you see they're being discreetly
kicked and those kicks are

5539
03:42:47,825 --> 03:42:50,802
water molecules hitting
them and they're discreet.

5540
03:42:50,801 --> 03:42:52,467
And in fact, it was,

5541
03:42:52,468 --> 03:42:55,254
it was really quite
interesting history. I mean,

5542
03:42:55,254 --> 03:42:59,331
Boltzmann had worked out how
things could be discreet and

5543
03:42:59,331 --> 03:43:02,045
had basically invented something
like quantum theory in,

5544
03:43:02,045 --> 03:43:03,761
in the 1860s.

5545
03:43:03,761 --> 03:43:06,833
And, but he just thought it
wasn't really the way it worked.

5546
03:43:06,833 --> 03:43:10,157
And then just a piece of physics history,

5547
03:43:10,156 --> 03:43:12,701
cause I think it's kind of
interesting, in, in 1900,

5548
03:43:12,701 --> 03:43:14,150
this guy called Max Plank,

5549
03:43:14,150 --> 03:43:17,536
who'd been a longtime
thermodynamics person who was trying

5550
03:43:17,536 --> 03:43:19,431
to, everybody was trying
to prove the second law of

5551
03:43:19,431 --> 03:43:21,483
thermodynamics, including Max Plank.

5552
03:43:21,483 --> 03:43:23,148
And Max Plank believed that radiation,

5553
03:43:23,148 --> 03:43:24,960
like electromagnetic radiation,

5554
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:28,322
somehow the interaction of
that with matter was going to

5555
03:43:28,322 --> 03:43:30,240
prove the second law of thermodynamics.

5556
03:43:30,240 --> 03:43:33,424
But he had these experiments
that people had done on black

5557
03:43:33,424 --> 03:43:34,755
body radiation,

5558
03:43:34,755 --> 03:43:38,259
and there were these curves
and you couldn't fit the curve

5559
03:43:38,259 --> 03:43:41,775
based on his idea for how
radiation interacted with matter.

5560
03:43:41,775 --> 03:43:43,444
Those curves, he couldn't,

5561
03:43:43,444 --> 03:43:45,851
he couldn't figure out
how to fit those curves,

5562
03:43:45,852 --> 03:43:49,136
except he noticed that if he
just did what Boltzmann had

5563
03:43:49,136 --> 03:43:52,452
done and assumed that
electromagnetic radiation was

5564
03:43:52,451 --> 03:43:55,453
discreet, he could fit the curves.

5565
03:43:55,453 --> 03:43:57,397
He said, but you know,
this is just a, you know,

5566
03:43:57,397 --> 03:43:59,159
it just happens to work this way.

5567
03:43:59,159 --> 03:44:01,472
Then Einstein came along
and said, well, by the way,

5568
03:44:01,472 --> 03:44:02,449
you know,

5569
03:44:02,449 --> 03:44:05,461
the electromagnetic field
might actually be discreet,

5570
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:07,271
it might be made of photons,

5571
03:44:07,272 --> 03:44:10,152
and then that explains how this all works.

5572
03:44:10,152 --> 03:44:12,326
And that was, you know, in 1905, that was,

5573
03:44:12,325 --> 03:44:14,543
that was how kind of,

5574
03:44:14,543 --> 03:44:17,891
that was how quant that piece
of quantum mechanics got

5575
03:44:17,891 --> 03:44:20,448
started. Kind of interesting,
interesting piece of history.

5576
03:44:20,448 --> 03:44:24,275
I didn't know until I was
researching this recently in 1904

5577
03:44:24,275 --> 03:44:27,769
and 1903, Einstein wrote
three different papers.

5578
03:44:27,769 --> 03:44:32,510
And so, you know, just sort
of well known physics history.

5579
03:44:32,510 --> 03:44:35,174
In 1905, Einstein wrote
these three papers.

5580
03:44:35,174 --> 03:44:37,166
One introduced relativity theory,

5581
03:44:37,165 --> 03:44:39,060
one explained brownie in motion,

5582
03:44:39,060 --> 03:44:41,666
and one introduced basically photons.

5583
03:44:41,666 --> 03:44:44,664
So kind of, you know, kind of a, a,

5584
03:44:44,665 --> 03:44:48,399
a big deal year for
physics and for Einstein.

5585
03:44:48,398 --> 03:44:50,112
But in the years before that,

5586
03:44:50,112 --> 03:44:52,909
he'd written several papers
and what were they about?

5587
03:44:52,909 --> 03:44:54,887
They were about the second
rule of thermodynamics,

5588
03:44:54,888 --> 03:44:57,469
and they were an attempt
to prove the second rule of

5589
03:44:57,468 --> 03:45:00,237
thermodynamics and their nonsense.

5590
03:45:00,237 --> 03:45:02,745
And so I I I had no idea
that he'd done this.

5591
03:45:02,745 --> 03:45:04,221
- Interesting. Me neither.

5592
03:45:04,221 --> 03:45:08,259
- And in fact, what he did,
those three papers in 1905,

5593
03:45:08,259 --> 03:45:09,996
well not so much the relativity paper,

5594
03:45:09,996 --> 03:45:12,675
the one on brown in
motion, the one on photons.

5595
03:45:12,675 --> 03:45:16,213
Both of these were about the story of

5596
03:45:16,213 --> 03:45:18,632
sort of making the world discreet.

5597
03:45:18,632 --> 03:45:21,980
And he got those, that
idea from Boltzmann.

5598
03:45:21,980 --> 03:45:23,435
But Boltzmann didn't think, you know,

5599
03:45:23,435 --> 03:45:25,869
Boltzmann kind of died
believing, you know,

5600
03:45:25,870 --> 03:45:28,824
he said he has a quote,
actually, you know, you know,

5601
03:45:28,824 --> 03:45:31,007
in the end, things are gonna
turn out to be discreet,

5602
03:45:31,007 --> 03:45:33,048
and I'm gonna write down
what I have to say about this

5603
03:45:33,049 --> 03:45:34,957
because, you know,

5604
03:45:34,957 --> 03:45:37,476
eventually this stuff will
be rediscovered and I want to

5605
03:45:37,476 --> 03:45:38,447
leave, you know,

5606
03:45:38,447 --> 03:45:40,750
what I can about how things
are gonna be discreet.

5607
03:45:40,750 --> 03:45:41,583
But, you know,

5608
03:45:41,583 --> 03:45:44,507
I think he has some quote
about how, you know,

5609
03:45:44,507 --> 03:45:48,659
one person can't stand against
the tide of history in,

5610
03:45:48,659 --> 03:45:52,826
in saying that, you
know, matter is discreet.

5611
03:45:52,826 --> 03:45:55,048
- Oh, so he's stuck by his guns

5612
03:45:55,049 --> 03:45:56,861
in terms of matter is discreet.

5613
03:45:56,861 --> 03:45:57,856
- Yes, he did.

5614
03:45:57,856 --> 03:46:01,084
And, and the, you know, what's
interesting about this is,

5615
03:46:01,084 --> 03:46:04,348
at the time, everybody,
including Einstein,

5616
03:46:04,349 --> 03:46:06,326
kind of assumed that space
was probably gonna end up

5617
03:46:06,326 --> 03:46:07,490
being discreet too.

5618
03:46:07,490 --> 03:46:09,694
But that didn't work out
technically because it wasn't

5619
03:46:09,694 --> 03:46:12,099
consistent with relativity
theory, or didn't seem to be.

5620
03:46:12,099 --> 03:46:14,331
And so then in the history of physics,

5621
03:46:14,331 --> 03:46:18,145
even though people had determined
that matter was discreet,

5622
03:46:18,145 --> 03:46:20,641
electro mag, magnetic field was discreet,

5623
03:46:20,641 --> 03:46:24,141
space was a holdout of not being discreet.

5624
03:46:25,191 --> 03:46:26,024
And in fact,

5625
03:46:26,023 --> 03:46:29,136
Einstein 1916 has this nice
letter he wrote where he says,

5626
03:46:29,137 --> 03:46:31,251
in the end, it will turn
out space is discreet,

5627
03:46:31,251 --> 03:46:33,820
but we don't have the mathematical
tools necessary to figure

5628
03:46:33,820 --> 03:46:35,986
out how that works yet.

5629
03:46:35,986 --> 03:46:37,875
And so, you know,

5630
03:46:37,876 --> 03:46:41,103
I think it's kind of cool that
a hundred years later we do.

5631
03:46:41,102 --> 03:46:42,446
- For you, you're pretty,

5632
03:46:42,447 --> 03:46:46,040
pretty sure that at every
layer of reality it's discreet.

5633
03:46:46,040 --> 03:46:50,214
- Right? And that space is
discreet and that the, I mean,

5634
03:46:50,213 --> 03:46:51,047
and in fact,

5635
03:46:51,047 --> 03:46:52,746
one of the things I've realized
recently is this kind of

5636
03:46:52,745 --> 03:46:54,186
theory of heat.

5637
03:46:54,186 --> 03:46:56,270
That, that the, you know,

5638
03:46:57,952 --> 03:47:01,157
that heat is really this
continuous fluid, it's,

5639
03:47:01,157 --> 03:47:04,218
it's kind of like the, the, you know,

5640
03:47:04,218 --> 03:47:05,513
the caloric theory of heat,

5641
03:47:05,513 --> 03:47:07,732
which turns out to be completely
wrong because actually heat

5642
03:47:07,733 --> 03:47:10,336
is the motion of discrete molecules.

5643
03:47:10,336 --> 03:47:11,729
Unless, you know there
are discreet molecules,

5644
03:47:11,729 --> 03:47:14,479
it's hard to understand
what heat could possibly be.

5645
03:47:14,479 --> 03:47:17,319
Well, you know, I think space is,

5646
03:47:17,319 --> 03:47:20,726
is discreet and the question
is kind of what's the analog of

5647
03:47:20,727 --> 03:47:25,727
the mistake that was made with
caloric in the case of space.

5648
03:47:25,745 --> 03:47:30,745
And so I'm, my, my current
guess is that dark matter is,

5649
03:47:30,893 --> 03:47:33,602
as I've, my little sort
of aphorism of the,

5650
03:47:33,602 --> 03:47:36,541
of the last few months has been, you know,

5651
03:47:36,541 --> 03:47:39,102
dark matter is the caloric of our time.

5652
03:47:39,102 --> 03:47:39,935
That is,

5653
03:47:39,935 --> 03:47:42,700
it will turn out that dark
matter is a feature of space and

5654
03:47:42,700 --> 03:47:45,283
it is not a bunch of particles.

5655
03:47:46,168 --> 03:47:47,430
You know, at the time when,

5656
03:47:47,430 --> 03:47:48,858
when people were talking about heat,

5657
03:47:48,858 --> 03:47:50,863
they knew about fluids
and they said, well,

5658
03:47:50,863 --> 03:47:52,591
heat must be just be
another kind of fluid.

5659
03:47:52,592 --> 03:47:54,292
Because that's what they knew about.

5660
03:47:54,292 --> 03:47:56,906
But now people know about
particles and so they say,

5661
03:47:56,906 --> 03:47:58,153
well, what's dark matter?

5662
03:47:58,154 --> 03:48:00,793
It's not, it's not, it
just must be particles.

5663
03:48:00,793 --> 03:48:03,747
- So what could dark matter
be as a feature of space?

5664
03:48:03,747 --> 03:48:05,042
- Oh, I don't know yet.

5665
03:48:05,042 --> 03:48:08,417
I mean, I think the, the thing I'm really,

5666
03:48:08,417 --> 03:48:10,742
one of the things I'm hoping
to be able to do is to find the

5667
03:48:10,742 --> 03:48:12,424
analog of brown in motion in space.

5668
03:48:12,424 --> 03:48:15,325
So in other words, brown in motion was,

5669
03:48:15,325 --> 03:48:18,033
was seeing down to the level of an effect

5670
03:48:18,032 --> 03:48:19,882
from individual molecules.

5671
03:48:19,882 --> 03:48:22,680
And so in the case of space,
you know, most of the things,

5672
03:48:22,680 --> 03:48:24,622
the things we see about space so far,

5673
03:48:24,622 --> 03:48:27,636
just everything seems continuous
brown in motion had been

5674
03:48:27,636 --> 03:48:29,579
discovered in the 1830s.

5675
03:48:29,579 --> 03:48:31,728
And it was only identified what it was,

5676
03:48:31,728 --> 03:48:32,988
what it was the, the,

5677
03:48:32,988 --> 03:48:36,862
the results of by Markowski and
Einstein at the beginning of

5678
03:48:36,862 --> 03:48:38,858
the 20th century.

5679
03:48:38,858 --> 03:48:40,202
And, you know, dark matter was,

5680
03:48:40,202 --> 03:48:41,911
was discovered that phenomenon

5681
03:48:41,911 --> 03:48:43,781
was discovered a hundred years ago.

5682
03:48:43,781 --> 03:48:44,993
You know, the rotation,

5683
03:48:44,994 --> 03:48:47,467
curves of galaxies don't follow
the luminous matter that was

5684
03:48:47,467 --> 03:48:50,106
discovered a hundred years ago.

5685
03:48:50,106 --> 03:48:51,917
And I think, you know, that I,

5686
03:48:51,917 --> 03:48:55,003
I wouldn't be surprised if
there isn't an effect that we

5687
03:48:55,004 --> 03:48:57,776
already know about that is
kind of the analog of brown in

5688
03:48:57,775 --> 03:49:01,558
motion that reveals the
discreetness of space.

5689
03:49:01,558 --> 03:49:04,013
And in fact, we we're
beginning to have some guesses.

5690
03:49:04,013 --> 03:49:04,877
We have some,

5691
03:49:04,878 --> 03:49:07,615
some evidence that black hole
mergers work differently when

5692
03:49:07,615 --> 03:49:09,478
there's discrete space.

5693
03:49:09,478 --> 03:49:11,742
And there may be things that
you can see in gravitational

5694
03:49:11,743 --> 03:49:14,826
wave signatures and things associated with

5695
03:49:14,825 --> 03:49:16,462
the discreetness of space.

5696
03:49:16,462 --> 03:49:18,601
But this is kind of, for me, it's kind of,

5697
03:49:18,602 --> 03:49:20,579
it's kind of interesting to
see this sort of recapitulation

5698
03:49:20,579 --> 03:49:23,951
of the history of physics
where people, you know,

5699
03:49:23,951 --> 03:49:27,023
vehemently say, you know,
matter is continuous,

5700
03:49:27,023 --> 03:49:29,112
electromagnetic field is continuous,

5701
03:49:29,112 --> 03:49:31,021
and turns out it isn't true.

5702
03:49:31,022 --> 03:49:32,495
And then they say space is continuous.

5703
03:49:32,495 --> 03:49:33,777
But, but, so, you know,

5704
03:49:33,777 --> 03:49:36,609
entropy is the number of
states of the system consistent

5705
03:49:36,609 --> 03:49:37,771
with some constraint.

5706
03:49:37,771 --> 03:49:38,676
- [Fridman] Yes.

5707
03:49:38,675 --> 03:49:41,507
- And the, the thing is that if you have,

5708
03:49:41,507 --> 03:49:43,872
if you know in great detail
the position of every molecule

5709
03:49:43,872 --> 03:49:46,122
in the gas, the entropy is,

5710
03:49:47,184 --> 03:49:51,709
is always zero because there's
only one possible state.

5711
03:49:51,709 --> 03:49:54,467
The, the configuration
of molecules in the gas,

5712
03:49:54,468 --> 03:49:55,969
the molecules bounce around,

5713
03:49:55,968 --> 03:49:58,368
they have a certain rule
for bouncing around.

5714
03:49:58,369 --> 03:50:01,020
There's just one state of the
gas evolves to one state of

5715
03:50:01,020 --> 03:50:02,433
the gas and so on.

5716
03:50:02,433 --> 03:50:04,955
But it's only if you don't
know in detail where all the

5717
03:50:04,954 --> 03:50:07,884
molecules are that you can say, well,

5718
03:50:07,884 --> 03:50:10,674
the entropy increases because the things

5719
03:50:10,674 --> 03:50:12,139
we do know about the molecules,

5720
03:50:12,139 --> 03:50:14,161
there are more possible
microscopic states of the system

5721
03:50:14,161 --> 03:50:16,244
consistent with what we do know

5722
03:50:16,244 --> 03:50:18,382
about where the molecules are.

5723
03:50:18,382 --> 03:50:21,222
And so the question of whether, so people,

5724
03:50:21,222 --> 03:50:24,573
this sort of paradox in a sense of, oh,

5725
03:50:24,573 --> 03:50:26,120
if we knew where all the molecules,

5726
03:50:26,120 --> 03:50:27,606
where the entropy wouldn't increase,

5727
03:50:27,606 --> 03:50:29,281
there was this idea introduced by,

5728
03:50:29,281 --> 03:50:32,198
by Gibbs in the early 20th century.

5729
03:50:33,263 --> 03:50:34,700
Well actually the very beginning of the,

5730
03:50:34,700 --> 03:50:37,784
of the 20th century as
a physics professor,

5731
03:50:37,784 --> 03:50:39,825
an American physics professor
was sort of the first

5732
03:50:39,825 --> 03:50:43,377
distinguished American
physics professor at Yale.

5733
03:50:43,377 --> 03:50:46,043
And he, he introduced this idea,

5734
03:50:46,903 --> 03:50:50,088
of course graining this
idea that, well, you know,

5735
03:50:50,088 --> 03:50:52,221
these molecules have a detailed
way they're bouncing around,

5736
03:50:52,221 --> 03:50:55,442
but we can only observe a
course grained version of that.

5737
03:50:55,442 --> 03:50:57,271
But the confusion has been,

5738
03:50:57,272 --> 03:51:00,778
nobody knew what a valid
course screening would be.

5739
03:51:00,778 --> 03:51:03,418
So nobody knew that whether
you could have this course

5740
03:51:03,418 --> 03:51:07,103
screening that very carefully
was sculpted in just such a

5741
03:51:07,103 --> 03:51:11,718
way that it would notice that
the particular configurations

5742
03:51:11,718 --> 03:51:14,469
that you could get from the
simple initial condition,

5743
03:51:14,469 --> 03:51:16,451
you know, they fit into
this course screening.

5744
03:51:16,451 --> 03:51:18,886
And the course screening
very carefully observes that.

5745
03:51:18,887 --> 03:51:22,345
Why can't you do that
kind of very detailed,

5746
03:51:22,344 --> 03:51:24,131
precise course screening?

5747
03:51:24,131 --> 03:51:26,841
The answer is because if you
are a computationally bounded

5748
03:51:26,842 --> 03:51:29,652
observer and the underlying
dynamics is computationally

5749
03:51:29,652 --> 03:51:31,777
irreducible, that's,

5750
03:51:31,777 --> 03:51:35,712
that's what defines possible
core screenings is what a

5751
03:51:35,712 --> 03:51:38,039
computationally, bounded observer can do.

5752
03:51:38,040 --> 03:51:39,036
And it's the,

5753
03:51:39,036 --> 03:51:42,970
it's the fact that a
computation bounded observer is,

5754
03:51:42,970 --> 03:51:47,506
is forced to look only at
this kind of coarse grained

5755
03:51:47,506 --> 03:51:49,738
version of what the system is doing.

5756
03:51:49,738 --> 03:51:52,679
That's why, and, and because the,

5757
03:51:52,679 --> 03:51:55,092
what what's what's going on
underneath is it's kind of

5758
03:51:55,092 --> 03:51:59,004
filling out this, this,
the, the different possible.

5759
03:51:59,004 --> 03:52:03,410
You're ending up with something
where the sort of underlying

5760
03:52:03,409 --> 03:52:06,826
computational irreducibility is your, if,

5761
03:52:09,337 --> 03:52:13,826
if all you can see is what the
course grained result is with

5762
03:52:13,826 --> 03:52:17,365
comp, with a sort of
computationally bounded observation,

5763
03:52:17,365 --> 03:52:20,987
then inevitably there are
many possible underlying

5764
03:52:20,987 --> 03:52:23,653
configurations that are
consistent with that.

5765
03:52:23,653 --> 03:52:25,875
- Just to clarify, I basically,

5766
03:52:25,875 --> 03:52:30,218
any observer that exists inside
the universe is going to be

5767
03:52:30,218 --> 03:52:31,897
computationally bounded.

5768
03:52:31,897 --> 03:52:34,102
- No. Any observer like us, I don't know.

5769
03:52:34,102 --> 03:52:34,947
I can't-.

5770
03:52:34,947 --> 03:52:36,603
- When you say like us, what do you mean?

5771
03:52:36,602 --> 03:52:38,277
What do you mean? Like us.

5772
03:52:38,278 --> 03:52:41,496
- Well, humans with finite minds.

5773
03:52:41,496 --> 03:52:44,136
- You're including the tools of science.

5774
03:52:44,137 --> 03:52:45,843
- Yeah, yeah.

5775
03:52:45,843 --> 03:52:49,361
I mean, and, and, and as we,
you know, we have more precise,

5776
03:52:49,361 --> 03:52:50,309
and, and by the way,

5777
03:52:50,308 --> 03:52:53,077
there are little sort of
microscopic violations of the

5778
03:52:53,077 --> 03:52:56,100
second row of thermodynamics
that you can start to have when

5779
03:52:56,101 --> 03:52:58,048
you have more precise
measurements of where precisely

5780
03:52:58,048 --> 03:52:59,284
molecules are.

5781
03:52:59,283 --> 03:53:00,465
- [Fridman] Right.

5782
03:53:00,465 --> 03:53:02,756
- But for, for on a large scale,

5783
03:53:02,756 --> 03:53:05,755
when you have enough molecules,
we don't have, you know,

5784
03:53:05,755 --> 03:53:08,336
we are not tracing all those
molecules and we just don't

5785
03:53:08,336 --> 03:53:10,986
have the computational
resources to do that.

5786
03:53:10,986 --> 03:53:14,730
And it wouldn't be, you
know, I think the, the,

5787
03:53:14,730 --> 03:53:18,934
to imagine what an observer
who is not computationally

5788
03:53:18,934 --> 03:53:20,300
bounded would be like,

5789
03:53:20,300 --> 03:53:23,302
it's an interesting thing because okay,

5790
03:53:23,302 --> 03:53:25,183
so what does computational
boundedness mean among other

5791
03:53:25,183 --> 03:53:29,467
things, it means we conclude
that definite things happen.

5792
03:53:29,468 --> 03:53:30,301
We go,

5793
03:53:30,300 --> 03:53:33,260
we take all this complexity
of the world and we make a

5794
03:53:33,261 --> 03:53:36,047
decision we're gonna
turn left or turn right.

5795
03:53:36,047 --> 03:53:40,797
And that is kind of reducing
all this kind of detail into

5796
03:53:42,870 --> 03:53:45,311
we're observing it, we're, we're, we're,

5797
03:53:45,311 --> 03:53:47,936
we're sort of crushing it
down to this, this one thing.

5798
03:53:47,936 --> 03:53:51,873
And, and that if we didn't
do that, we wouldn't,

5799
03:53:51,873 --> 03:53:54,582
we wouldn't have all this
sort of symbolic structure

5800
03:53:54,582 --> 03:53:57,665
that we build up that lets us think things

5801
03:53:57,665 --> 03:53:59,790
through with our finite minds.

5802
03:53:59,790 --> 03:54:01,949
We'd be instead, you know, we'd be just,

5803
03:54:01,949 --> 03:54:04,768
we'd be sort of one with the universe, so-

5804
03:54:04,768 --> 03:54:08,378
- Yeah. So content to not simplify.

5805
03:54:08,378 --> 03:54:13,153
- Yes. If we didn't simplify,
then we wouldn't be like us.

5806
03:54:13,153 --> 03:54:16,027
We would be like the universe, like the,

5807
03:54:16,027 --> 03:54:17,501
the intrinsic universe,

5808
03:54:17,501 --> 03:54:20,680
but not having experiences
like the experiences we have

5809
03:54:20,680 --> 03:54:24,786
where we, for example, conclude
that definite things happen.

5810
03:54:24,786 --> 03:54:27,475
We, you know, we, we sort of have this,

5811
03:54:27,475 --> 03:54:30,308
this notion of being able to make,

5812
03:54:31,191 --> 03:54:33,691
make sort of narrative statements.

5813
03:54:33,691 --> 03:54:36,342
- I wonder if it's just like
you imagined as a thought

5814
03:54:36,343 --> 03:54:38,854
experiment what it's
like to be a computer.

5815
03:54:38,853 --> 03:54:41,549
I wonder if it's possible to
try to begin to imagine what

5816
03:54:41,549 --> 03:54:46,014
it's like to be in an unbounded
computational observer.

5817
03:54:46,014 --> 03:54:46,847
- Well.

5818
03:54:46,847 --> 03:54:51,097
Okay, so here's, here's
how that I think plays out.

5819
03:54:52,003 --> 03:54:53,668
- So I mean,

5820
03:54:53,668 --> 03:54:56,843
in this we talk about this ruliad,

5821
03:54:56,843 --> 03:54:58,041
this space of all possible computations.

5822
03:54:58,041 --> 03:54:58,891
- [Fridman] Yes.

5823
03:54:58,891 --> 03:55:00,918
- And this idea of, you know,

5824
03:55:00,918 --> 03:55:02,609
being at a certain place in the ruliad,

5825
03:55:02,609 --> 03:55:05,841
which corresponds to
sort of a certain way of,

5826
03:55:05,841 --> 03:55:09,021
of rep of a certain set of
computations that you are

5827
03:55:09,021 --> 03:55:11,396
representing things in terms of, okay,

5828
03:55:11,396 --> 03:55:14,625
so as you expand out in the ruliad,

5829
03:55:14,625 --> 03:55:17,655
as you kind of encompass more possible

5830
03:55:17,655 --> 03:55:18,888
views of the universe,

5831
03:55:18,888 --> 03:55:21,709
as you encompass more possible
kinds of computations that

5832
03:55:21,709 --> 03:55:24,983
you can do, eventually you
might say that's a real win.

5833
03:55:24,983 --> 03:55:27,648
You know, we are, we're colonizing
the ruliad, we're, we're,

5834
03:55:27,647 --> 03:55:29,980
we are building out more paradigms

5835
03:55:29,980 --> 03:55:31,469
about how to think about things.

5836
03:55:31,469 --> 03:55:33,295
And eventually you might say, we, we,

5837
03:55:33,295 --> 03:55:36,676
we won all the way we managed
to colonize the whole ruliad.

5838
03:55:36,676 --> 03:55:38,439
Okay, here's the problem with that.

5839
03:55:38,439 --> 03:55:41,176
The problem is that the
notion of existence,

5840
03:55:41,176 --> 03:55:45,174
coherent existence requires
some kind of specialization by

5841
03:55:45,174 --> 03:55:47,128
the time you are the whole ruliad,

5842
03:55:47,129 --> 03:55:50,647
by the time you cover the
whole ruliad in no useful sense

5843
03:55:50,647 --> 03:55:52,855
do you coherently exist.

5844
03:55:52,854 --> 03:55:53,871
So in other words,

5845
03:55:53,871 --> 03:55:57,316
in in interesting the notion of existence,

5846
03:55:57,316 --> 03:55:59,883
the notion of what we think of as, as,

5847
03:55:59,884 --> 03:56:03,691
as definite existence requires
this kind of specialization

5848
03:56:03,691 --> 03:56:06,808
requires this kind of idea that we are,

5849
03:56:06,808 --> 03:56:09,391
we are not all possible things.

5850
03:56:10,231 --> 03:56:13,468
We are the, a particular set of things.

5851
03:56:13,468 --> 03:56:16,759
And that's kind of how we,
that that's kind of what,

5852
03:56:16,759 --> 03:56:19,350
what makes us have a coherent existence.

5853
03:56:19,350 --> 03:56:22,422
If we were spread throughout
the ruliad we would not,

5854
03:56:22,422 --> 03:56:26,078
there would be no coherence
to the way that we work.

5855
03:56:26,078 --> 03:56:27,889
We would work in all possible ways.

5856
03:56:27,889 --> 03:56:31,453
And that wouldn't be kind
of a, a notion of identity.

5857
03:56:31,453 --> 03:56:33,181
We wouldn't have this notion of kind of,

5858
03:56:33,181 --> 03:56:35,431
of of of coherent identity.

5859
03:56:36,952 --> 03:56:41,149
- I am geographically
located somewhere exactly,

5860
03:56:41,149 --> 03:56:43,567
precisely in the ruliad, therefore I am

5861
03:56:43,567 --> 03:56:45,725
is the decart kind of-

5862
03:56:45,726 --> 03:56:46,591
- Yeah, yeah.

5863
03:56:46,591 --> 03:56:47,424
Right.

5864
03:56:47,424 --> 03:56:48,976
Were you are in a certain
place in physical space

5865
03:56:48,976 --> 03:56:50,710
or in a certain place in ruliad space.

5866
03:56:50,709 --> 03:56:54,966
And if, if you are, if you
are sufficiently spread out,

5867
03:56:54,967 --> 03:56:59,171
you are no longer coherent
and you no longer have,

5868
03:56:59,171 --> 03:57:00,730
I mean, in, in the,

5869
03:57:00,730 --> 03:57:01,564
in our perception of
what it means to exist

5870
03:57:01,564 --> 03:57:03,564
and to have experience.

5871
03:57:05,122 --> 03:57:06,637
Doesn't happen that way.

5872
03:57:06,638 --> 03:57:07,502
- So therefore,

5873
03:57:07,502 --> 03:57:10,479
so to to to exist means to
be computationally bounded.

5874
03:57:10,479 --> 03:57:12,565
- I think so, to exist in the way

5875
03:57:12,566 --> 03:57:15,384
that we think of ourselves
as existing. Yes.

5876
03:57:15,384 --> 03:57:18,484
- The very active existence is
like operating in this place

5877
03:57:18,484 --> 03:57:20,413
that's computation irreducible.

5878
03:57:20,413 --> 03:57:22,729
So that this is just giant mess
of things going on that you

5879
03:57:22,729 --> 03:57:24,663
can't possibly predict.

5880
03:57:24,663 --> 03:57:28,393
But nevertheless, because
of your limitations, you,

5881
03:57:28,393 --> 03:57:30,068
you have an imperative of like,

5882
03:57:30,068 --> 03:57:33,083
what is it an imperative
or a skillset to simplify

5883
03:57:33,084 --> 03:57:35,856
or an ignorance sufficient level.

5884
03:57:35,856 --> 03:57:36,690
- Okay.

5885
03:57:36,690 --> 03:57:38,497
So the thing which is not
obvious is that you are taking a

5886
03:57:38,496 --> 03:57:40,213
slice of all this complexity,

5887
03:57:40,213 --> 03:57:42,180
just like we have all of these molecules

5888
03:57:42,180 --> 03:57:43,859
bouncing around in the room.

5889
03:57:43,859 --> 03:57:46,460
But all we notice is,
you know, the, the, the,

5890
03:57:46,459 --> 03:57:49,100
the kind of the flow of the
air or the pressure of the air.

5891
03:57:49,101 --> 03:57:51,597
We are just noticing
these particular things.

5892
03:57:51,597 --> 03:57:56,519
And the, the big interesting
thing is that there are rules,

5893
03:57:56,519 --> 03:57:59,719
there are laws that govern
those big things that we,

5894
03:57:59,719 --> 03:58:00,552
we observe.

5895
03:58:00,552 --> 03:58:01,479
- [Fridman] Yeah.

5896
03:58:01,479 --> 03:58:02,557
So it's not obvious.

5897
03:58:02,558 --> 03:58:04,472
- Amazing because it doesn't
feel like it's a slice.

5898
03:58:04,471 --> 03:58:05,305
- [Wolfram] Yeah. Well, right.

5899
03:58:05,305 --> 03:58:07,488
- It's not a slice. Well, it's like a,

5900
03:58:07,488 --> 03:58:09,670
it's like an abstraction.

5901
03:58:09,670 --> 03:58:13,194
- Yes. But I mean the fact
that the gas laws work.

5902
03:58:13,194 --> 03:58:15,342
That we can describe pressure,
volume, et cetera, et cetera,

5903
03:58:15,342 --> 03:58:16,175
et cetera.

5904
03:58:16,174 --> 03:58:18,408
And we don't have to go down to the level

5905
03:58:18,408 --> 03:58:20,350
of talking about individual molecules.

5906
03:58:20,350 --> 03:58:22,173
That is a non-trivial fact.

5907
03:58:22,173 --> 03:58:23,847
And, and here's the thing that I,

5908
03:58:23,846 --> 03:58:26,295
sort of exciting thing
as far as I'm concerned,

5909
03:58:26,295 --> 03:58:31,135
the fact that there are certain
aspects of the universe.

5910
03:58:31,135 --> 03:58:31,968
So, you know,

5911
03:58:31,968 --> 03:58:34,315
we think space is made ultimately
these atoms of space and

5912
03:58:34,315 --> 03:58:36,212
these hypergraphs and so on.

5913
03:58:36,212 --> 03:58:38,250
And we think that,

5914
03:58:38,250 --> 03:58:42,425
but we nevertheless perceive
the universe at a large scale

5915
03:58:42,425 --> 03:58:44,840
to be like continuous space and so on.

5916
03:58:44,840 --> 03:58:46,923
We, in quantum mechanics,

5917
03:58:47,995 --> 03:58:50,805
we think that there are
these many threads of time,

5918
03:58:50,806 --> 03:58:54,836
these many threads of
history, yet we kind of span.

5919
03:58:54,835 --> 03:58:56,995
So, so, you know, in,
in quantum mechanics,

5920
03:58:56,995 --> 03:58:58,677
in our models of physics,

5921
03:58:58,677 --> 03:59:01,613
there are these time
is not a single thread.

5922
03:59:01,613 --> 03:59:03,717
Time breaks into many threads.

5923
03:59:03,718 --> 03:59:05,218
They branch, they merge and,

5924
03:59:05,218 --> 03:59:10,210
but we are part of that
branching, merging universe.

5925
03:59:10,209 --> 03:59:13,654
And so our brains are also
branching and merging.

5926
03:59:13,655 --> 03:59:16,201
And so when we perceive the universe,

5927
03:59:16,200 --> 03:59:20,794
we are branching brains
perceiving a branching universe.

5928
03:59:20,795 --> 03:59:24,295
And so the fact that the claim that we ex,

5929
03:59:25,403 --> 03:59:28,248
we believe that we are persistent in time,

5930
03:59:28,248 --> 03:59:30,397
we have this single thread of experience.

5931
03:59:30,397 --> 03:59:33,253
That's the statement that
somehow we managed to aggregate

5932
03:59:33,254 --> 03:59:36,159
together those separate threads
of time that are separated

5933
03:59:36,158 --> 03:59:37,836
in, in the operation of,

5934
03:59:37,836 --> 03:59:40,274
in the fundamental
operation of the universe.

5935
03:59:40,274 --> 03:59:41,953
So just as in space,

5936
03:59:41,953 --> 03:59:44,403
we're averaging over
some big region of space,

5937
03:59:44,403 --> 03:59:45,653
and we are looking at many,

5938
03:59:45,653 --> 03:59:48,387
many at the aggregate effects
of many atoms of space.

5939
03:59:48,387 --> 03:59:51,125
So similarly in what we
call branchial space,

5940
03:59:51,125 --> 03:59:53,486
the space of these,
these quantum branches,

5941
03:59:53,486 --> 03:59:56,969
we are effectively averaging
over many different branches

5942
03:59:56,968 --> 04:00:00,100
of possible, of histories of the universe.

5943
04:00:00,101 --> 04:00:03,354
And so in and in, in thermodynamics,

5944
04:00:03,353 --> 04:00:06,003
we're averaging over many
configurations of, you know, many,

5945
04:00:06,004 --> 04:00:08,791
many possible positions of molecules.

5946
04:00:08,790 --> 04:00:10,886
So what what we see here is,

5947
04:00:10,887 --> 04:00:13,730
so the question is when you
do that averaging for space,

5948
04:00:13,729 --> 04:00:16,296
what are the aggregate laws of space?

5949
04:00:16,297 --> 04:00:18,397
When you do that averaging
of a branchial space,

5950
04:00:18,397 --> 04:00:21,734
what are the aggregate
laws of branchial space,

5951
04:00:21,734 --> 04:00:24,698
when you do that averaging
over the molecules and so on,

5952
04:00:24,698 --> 04:00:27,000
what are the aggregate laws you get?

5953
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:29,399
And this is, this is the thing that I,

5954
04:00:29,399 --> 04:00:33,397
I think is just amazingly,
amazingly neat that.

5955
04:00:33,397 --> 04:00:35,915
- [Fridman] That there are
aggregate laws at all for-

5956
04:00:35,915 --> 04:00:37,354
- Sure. Well, yes,

5957
04:00:37,354 --> 04:00:38,814
but the question is what
are those aggregate laws?

5958
04:00:38,815 --> 04:00:40,302
So the answer is for space,

5959
04:00:40,302 --> 04:00:43,061
the aggregate laws are
Einstein's equations for gravity,

5960
04:00:43,061 --> 04:00:46,436
for the structure of space
time, for branchial space.

5961
04:00:46,436 --> 04:00:49,378
The aggregate laws are the
laws of quantum mechanics.

5962
04:00:49,379 --> 04:00:52,990
And for the case of, of
molecules and things,

5963
04:00:52,989 --> 04:00:55,010
the aggregate laws are basically

5964
04:00:55,010 --> 04:00:57,244
the second law of thermodynamics.

5965
04:00:57,244 --> 04:00:59,463
And so the, the, that's the,

5966
04:00:59,463 --> 04:01:00,297
and the things that follow from

5967
04:01:00,297 --> 04:01:02,640
the second law of thermodynamics.

5968
04:01:02,639 --> 04:01:06,189
And so what that means is that the three

5969
04:01:06,190 --> 04:01:08,352
great theories of 20th century physics,

5970
04:01:08,352 --> 04:01:11,112
which are basically generality
of the theory of gravity,

5971
04:01:11,111 --> 04:01:14,306
quantum mechanics, and
statistical mechanics,

5972
04:01:14,307 --> 04:01:15,890
which is what kind of grows outta

5973
04:01:15,889 --> 04:01:17,626
the second row of thermodynamics.

5974
04:01:17,626 --> 04:01:20,041
All three of the great theories
of 20th century physics are

5975
04:01:20,040 --> 04:01:23,373
the result of this interplay between

5976
04:01:23,373 --> 04:01:26,134
computational irreducibility,

5977
04:01:26,134 --> 04:01:28,586
and the computational
boundedness of observers.

5978
04:01:28,586 --> 04:01:30,265
And you know, for me,

5979
04:01:30,265 --> 04:01:34,599
this is really neat because it
means that all three of these

5980
04:01:34,599 --> 04:01:36,747
laws are derivable.

5981
04:01:36,747 --> 04:01:39,073
So we used to think that, for example,

5982
04:01:39,074 --> 04:01:41,042
Einstein's equations
were just sort of a wheel

5983
04:01:41,041 --> 04:01:42,804
in feature of our universe.

5984
04:01:42,804 --> 04:01:44,957
That they could be,
universe might be that way.

5985
04:01:44,957 --> 04:01:47,715
It might not be that way.
Quantum mechanics is just like,

5986
04:01:47,715 --> 04:01:49,790
well, it just happens to be that way.

5987
04:01:49,790 --> 04:01:52,347
And the second law people
kind of thought, well,

5988
04:01:52,347 --> 04:01:53,747
maybe it is derivable.

5989
04:01:53,747 --> 04:01:56,402
Okay? What turns out to be the
case is that all three of the

5990
04:01:56,402 --> 04:01:58,972
fundamental principles
of physics are derivable,

5991
04:01:58,972 --> 04:02:01,897
but they're not derivable
just from mathematics.

5992
04:02:01,897 --> 04:02:05,750
They require, or just from some
kind of logical computation,

5993
04:02:05,750 --> 04:02:10,010
they require one more thing.
They require that the observer,

5994
04:02:10,010 --> 04:02:13,454
that the thing that is sampling
the way the universe works

5995
04:02:13,454 --> 04:02:16,212
is an observer who has
these characteristics of

5996
04:02:16,212 --> 04:02:18,421
computational boundedness of belief

5997
04:02:18,421 --> 04:02:20,363
and persistence and time.

5998
04:02:20,363 --> 04:02:21,197
And so that,

5999
04:02:21,197 --> 04:02:25,978
that means that it is the
nature of the observer you know,

6000
04:02:25,977 --> 04:02:28,029
the rough nature of the observer.

6001
04:02:28,030 --> 04:02:29,123
Not the details of, oh,

6002
04:02:29,122 --> 04:02:30,801
we've got two eyes and we observe photons

6003
04:02:30,801 --> 04:02:32,324
of this frequency and so on.

6004
04:02:32,324 --> 04:02:34,003
But the, the, the,

6005
04:02:34,003 --> 04:02:37,448
the kind of the very coarse
features of the observer then

6006
04:02:37,448 --> 04:02:41,898
imply these very precise
facts about physics.

6007
04:02:41,898 --> 04:02:44,360
And it's, it's, I think it's amazing.

6008
04:02:44,361 --> 04:02:48,012
- So if we just look at
the actual experience

6009
04:02:48,012 --> 04:02:50,913
of the observer that we
experience this reality,

6010
04:02:50,913 --> 04:02:52,762
it seems real to us.

6011
04:02:52,762 --> 04:02:55,068
And you're saying because
of our bonded nature,

6012
04:02:55,067 --> 04:02:57,742
it's actually all an illusion.

6013
04:02:57,743 --> 04:02:58,576
It's an a simplification.

6014
04:02:58,575 --> 04:03:00,821
- Well, yeah. It's a
simplification. Right?

6015
04:03:00,822 --> 04:03:01,685
What's what's, well.

6016
04:03:01,685 --> 04:03:04,217
- You don't think a
simplification is an illusion?

6017
04:03:04,218 --> 04:03:08,334
- No, I mean it's, it's,
well, I don't know. I mean-

6018
04:03:08,334 --> 04:03:09,167
- What is real?

6019
04:03:09,166 --> 04:03:10,695
- What's underneath?

6020
04:03:10,695 --> 04:03:12,805
Okay, that's an interesting question.

6021
04:03:12,805 --> 04:03:13,805
What's real?

6022
04:03:15,085 --> 04:03:17,307
And that relates to the whole question of

6023
04:03:17,308 --> 04:03:19,492
why does the universe exist?

6024
04:03:19,492 --> 04:03:20,681
And, you know,

6025
04:03:20,681 --> 04:03:23,318
what is the difference
between reality and a mere

6026
04:03:23,317 --> 04:03:25,371
representation of what's going on?

6027
04:03:25,371 --> 04:03:26,608
- [Fridman] Yes.

6028
04:03:26,609 --> 04:03:28,960
We experience the representation.

6029
04:03:28,959 --> 04:03:29,893
- Yes.

6030
04:03:29,894 --> 04:03:34,894
But the, the question of, so,
so one question is, you know,

6031
04:03:35,066 --> 04:03:39,572
why is there a thing which
we can experience that way?

6032
04:03:39,573 --> 04:03:43,323
And the answer is because
this ruliad object,

6033
04:03:44,334 --> 04:03:48,454
which is this entangled limit
of all possible computations,

6034
04:03:48,453 --> 04:03:52,148
there is no choice about
it. It has to exist.

6035
04:03:52,148 --> 04:03:54,461
It has to, there has to be such a thing.

6036
04:03:54,461 --> 04:03:57,688
It is in, in the same sense
that, you know, two plus two,

6037
04:03:57,688 --> 04:04:00,798
if you define what two is and
you plot pluses and so on,

6038
04:04:00,798 --> 04:04:03,104
two plus two has to equal four.

6039
04:04:03,103 --> 04:04:04,005
Similarly,

6040
04:04:04,005 --> 04:04:07,099
this rule ad this limit of
all possible computations just

6041
04:04:07,099 --> 04:04:09,547
has to be a thing you, that is,

6042
04:04:09,547 --> 04:04:11,888
once you have the idea of computation,

6043
04:04:11,888 --> 04:04:14,221
you inevitably have the ruliad.

6044
04:04:14,220 --> 04:04:15,724
- [Fridman] You're gonna have
to have a ruliad. Yeah, yeah.

6045
04:04:15,724 --> 04:04:17,211
- Right? And, and what's
important about it,

6046
04:04:17,211 --> 04:04:19,551
there's just one of it, it's, it's,

6047
04:04:19,551 --> 04:04:22,766
it's just this unique object
and that unique object

6048
04:04:22,766 --> 04:04:24,350
necessarily exists.

6049
04:04:25,622 --> 04:04:27,702
And then the question is what?

6050
04:04:27,702 --> 04:04:29,380
And then we once,

6051
04:04:29,380 --> 04:04:34,380
once you know that we are
sort of embedded in that and

6052
04:04:34,602 --> 04:04:36,208
taking samples of it,

6053
04:04:36,208 --> 04:04:39,676
that it's sort of inevitable
that there is this thing that

6054
04:04:39,676 --> 04:04:42,748
we can perceive that is, you know, that,

6055
04:04:42,748 --> 04:04:46,586
that our perception of kind of physical

6056
04:04:46,586 --> 04:04:49,850
reality necessarily is that way,

6057
04:04:49,851 --> 04:04:51,647
given that we are observers with

6058
04:04:51,647 --> 04:04:53,614
the characteristics we have.

6059
04:04:53,613 --> 04:04:54,447
So in other words,

6060
04:04:54,447 --> 04:04:59,037
the fact that the fact that
the universe exists, is it,

6061
04:04:59,037 --> 04:05:02,265
it's actually, it's almost
like it's, you know,

6062
04:05:02,265 --> 04:05:04,641
to think about it almost
theologically so to speak.

6063
04:05:04,641 --> 04:05:06,895
And I, and I've, I've really, it, it's,

6064
04:05:06,895 --> 04:05:08,912
it's funny because a lot
of the questions about the

6065
04:05:08,912 --> 04:05:11,385
existence of the universe and so on, they,

6066
04:05:11,385 --> 04:05:14,898
they transcend what kind of
the science of the last few

6067
04:05:14,898 --> 04:05:17,360
hundred years has really been
concerned with the science of

6068
04:05:17,361 --> 04:05:18,535
the last few hundred years.

6069
04:05:18,534 --> 04:05:21,057
Hasn't thought it could talk
about questions like that.

6070
04:05:21,057 --> 04:05:21,890
- [Fridman] Yeah.

6071
04:05:21,889 --> 04:05:24,476
And, but I think it's kind of,

6072
04:05:24,477 --> 04:05:26,396
and so a lot of the kind
of arguments of, you know,

6073
04:05:26,396 --> 04:05:28,065
does God exist, you know,

6074
04:05:28,065 --> 04:05:31,039
is it obvious that I
think it in some sense,

6075
04:05:31,039 --> 04:05:33,282
in some representation, it's sort of more,

6076
04:05:33,281 --> 04:05:35,047
more obvious that,

6077
04:05:35,048 --> 04:05:39,068
that something sort of bigger
than us exists than that we

6078
04:05:39,067 --> 04:05:41,275
exist and we are, you know,

6079
04:05:41,275 --> 04:05:45,308
our existence and as observers
the way we are is sort of a

6080
04:05:45,308 --> 04:05:48,126
contingent thing about the universe.

6081
04:05:48,127 --> 04:05:49,917
And it's more inevitable that the whole,

6082
04:05:49,916 --> 04:05:52,448
the whole universe kind
of the whole set of all

6083
04:05:52,449 --> 04:05:54,845
possibilities, exists.

6084
04:05:54,844 --> 04:05:56,565
But, but this question about, you know,

6085
04:05:56,566 --> 04:05:59,483
is is it real or is it an illusion?

6086
04:06:00,404 --> 04:06:03,894
You know, all we know is our experience.

6087
04:06:03,894 --> 04:06:06,144
And so the fact that, well,

6088
04:06:07,230 --> 04:06:10,411
our experience is this
absolutely microscopic piece of

6089
04:06:10,411 --> 04:06:14,744
sample of the ruliad, and
we are, and, and you know,

6090
04:06:16,182 --> 04:06:18,899
there's this this point about, you know,

6091
04:06:18,898 --> 04:06:21,778
we might sample more and more
of the ruliad we might learn

6092
04:06:21,779 --> 04:06:24,596
more and more about, we
might learn, you know, like,

6093
04:06:24,596 --> 04:06:26,637
like different areas of physics,

6094
04:06:26,637 --> 04:06:28,811
like quantum mechanics for example.

6095
04:06:28,810 --> 04:06:30,067
The fact that it,

6096
04:06:30,067 --> 04:06:33,599
it was discovered I think is
closely related to the fact

6097
04:06:33,600 --> 04:06:36,369
that electronic amplifiers were
invented that allowed you to

6098
04:06:36,369 --> 04:06:39,057
take a small effect and amplify it up,

6099
04:06:39,057 --> 04:06:40,775
which hadn't been possible before.

6100
04:06:40,774 --> 04:06:42,575
You know, microscopes had been invented

6101
04:06:42,575 --> 04:06:44,468
that magnify things and so on.

6102
04:06:44,468 --> 04:06:45,343
But the, you know,

6103
04:06:45,343 --> 04:06:48,236
having a very small effect and
being able to magnify it was

6104
04:06:48,236 --> 04:06:50,623
sort of a new thing that allowed
one to see a different sort

6105
04:06:50,623 --> 04:06:53,141
of aspect of the universe

6106
04:06:53,141 --> 04:06:55,110
and let one discover this kind of thing.

6107
04:06:55,110 --> 04:06:55,974
So, you know,

6108
04:06:55,974 --> 04:06:59,153
we can expect that in the
ruliad there are an infinite

6109
04:06:59,153 --> 04:07:01,820
collection of new things we can discover.

6110
04:07:01,820 --> 04:07:03,159
There's, there's in fact computational

6111
04:07:03,159 --> 04:07:04,893
irreducibility kind of guarantees

6112
04:07:04,893 --> 04:07:07,292
that there will be an infinite
collection of kind of,

6113
04:07:07,292 --> 04:07:12,042
you know, pockets of reducibility
that can be discovered.

6114
04:07:13,004 --> 04:07:16,212
- Boy, would it be fun to take a walk

6115
04:07:16,212 --> 04:07:18,599
down the ruliad and see what
kind of stuff we find there?

6116
04:07:18,599 --> 04:07:21,228
You you write about alien intelligences.

6117
04:07:21,228 --> 04:07:22,061
- [Wolfram] Yes.

6118
04:07:22,061 --> 04:07:23,172
- I mean, just these worlds.

6119
04:07:23,172 --> 04:07:27,049
- Yes. Well, the problem
with these worlds is that.

6120
04:07:27,049 --> 04:07:27,882
- We can't talk to 'em.

6121
04:07:27,881 --> 04:07:28,715
- [Wolfram] Yes.

6122
04:07:28,715 --> 04:07:30,193
And, and you know,

6123
04:07:30,193 --> 04:07:33,962
the thing is what I've kind of
spent a lot of time doing of

6124
04:07:33,962 --> 04:07:36,891
just studying computational
systems, seeing what they do,

6125
04:07:36,891 --> 04:07:40,559
what I now call ruliology, kind
of just the study of rules.

6126
04:07:40,559 --> 04:07:41,819
- [Fridman] Yeah.

6127
04:07:41,819 --> 04:07:42,733
- And what they do.

6128
04:07:42,733 --> 04:07:43,680
You know,

6129
04:07:43,680 --> 04:07:45,854
you can kind of easily jump
somewhere else in the ruliad

6130
04:07:45,853 --> 04:07:48,479
and start seeing what do these rules do?

6131
04:07:48,479 --> 04:07:49,313
- [Fridman] Yeah.

6132
04:07:49,313 --> 04:07:50,764
- And what you says they, they just,

6133
04:07:50,764 --> 04:07:53,400
they do what they do and
there's no human connection,

6134
04:07:53,400 --> 04:07:54,289
so to speak.

6135
04:07:54,290 --> 04:07:59,218
- Did you think, you know,
some, some people are able to

6136
04:07:59,218 --> 04:08:00,726
communicate with animals.

6137
04:08:00,726 --> 04:08:05,421
Do you think you can
become a whisper of these?

6138
04:08:05,421 --> 04:08:06,254
- I've been trying.

6139
04:08:06,254 --> 04:08:07,709
That's what I've spent
some part of my life doing.

6140
04:08:07,709 --> 04:08:09,953
- Have, have you, have
you heard, and I mean,

6141
04:08:09,952 --> 04:08:11,933
are you at the risk of losing your mind?

6142
04:08:11,933 --> 04:08:16,015
- Sort of my favorite science
discovery is this fact that

6143
04:08:16,015 --> 04:08:16,849
these very simple programs

6144
04:08:16,849 --> 04:08:19,073
can produce very complicated behavior.

6145
04:08:19,073 --> 04:08:19,906
- [Fridman] Yeah.

6146
04:08:19,906 --> 04:08:23,246
- And that, and that fact
is kind of in a sense,

6147
04:08:23,245 --> 04:08:27,365
a whispering of something out
in the computational universe

6148
04:08:27,365 --> 04:08:30,027
that we didn't really
know was there before.

6149
04:08:30,027 --> 04:08:33,078
I mean, it, it's, you know,
I it's like, you know,

6150
04:08:33,078 --> 04:08:36,811
back in the 1980s I was doing
a bunch of work with some

6151
04:08:36,811 --> 04:08:39,200
very, very good mathematicians,

6152
04:08:39,200 --> 04:08:41,084
and they were like trying
to pick away, you know,

6153
04:08:41,084 --> 04:08:42,792
can we figure out what's going on

6154
04:08:42,792 --> 04:08:44,197
in these computational systems?

6155
04:08:44,197 --> 04:08:46,384
And they, they basically said, look,

6156
04:08:46,384 --> 04:08:49,217
the math we have just doesn't
get anywhere with this.

6157
04:08:49,217 --> 04:08:51,086
We're stuck. There's nothing to say.

6158
04:08:51,085 --> 04:08:52,755
We have nothing to say.

6159
04:08:52,755 --> 04:08:54,014
And, you know, in a sense,

6160
04:08:54,014 --> 04:08:57,577
perhaps my main achievement at
that time was to realize that

6161
04:08:57,577 --> 04:08:59,247
the very fact that the,

6162
04:08:59,247 --> 04:09:03,564
the good mathematicians had
nothing to say was itself

6163
04:09:03,565 --> 04:09:05,051
a very interesting thing.

6164
04:09:05,051 --> 04:09:06,940
That was kind of a, a sort of,

6165
04:09:06,940 --> 04:09:07,773
in some sense,

6166
04:09:07,772 --> 04:09:09,939
a whispering of a different
part of the ruliad that one

6167
04:09:09,940 --> 04:09:12,735
hadn't, you know, one wasn't,

6168
04:09:12,735 --> 04:09:14,967
was not accessible from
what we knew in mathematics

6169
04:09:14,967 --> 04:09:16,468
and so on.

6170
04:09:16,468 --> 04:09:20,606
- Does it make you sad that
you're exploring some of these

6171
04:09:20,606 --> 04:09:23,363
gigantic ideas and it feels
like we're on the verge of

6172
04:09:23,363 --> 04:09:27,038
breaking through to some
very interesting discoveries,

6173
04:09:27,039 --> 04:09:30,247
and yet you're just a finite being

6174
04:09:30,246 --> 04:09:33,121
that's going to die way too soon?

6175
04:09:33,121 --> 04:09:36,194
And that scan of your brain or
your full body kind of shows

6176
04:09:36,194 --> 04:09:37,865
that you're-

6177
04:09:37,865 --> 04:09:39,498
- Yeah, it's just a bunch of meat.

6178
04:09:39,498 --> 04:09:42,604
- It's just a bunch of meat.

6179
04:09:42,604 --> 04:09:45,243
Yeah. Does that make you
make you a little sad?

6180
04:09:45,243 --> 04:09:46,448
- It's kind of a shame. I mean,

6181
04:09:46,448 --> 04:09:48,676
I kinda like to see how
all this stuff works out,

6182
04:09:48,676 --> 04:09:50,349
but I think the thing
to realize, you know,

6183
04:09:50,349 --> 04:09:52,494
it's an interesting sort of
thought experiment. You know,

6184
04:09:52,494 --> 04:09:54,957
you, you say, okay, you know,

6185
04:09:54,957 --> 04:09:56,733
let's assume we can get cryonics to work,

6186
04:09:56,733 --> 04:09:58,543
and one day it will,

6187
04:09:58,543 --> 04:09:59,920
that will be one of these things

6188
04:09:59,920 --> 04:10:01,566
that's kind of like ChatGPT.

6189
04:10:01,566 --> 04:10:03,691
One day somebody will
figure out, you know,

6190
04:10:03,691 --> 04:10:08,181
how to get water from zero
degrees centigrade down to,

6191
04:10:08,181 --> 04:10:10,556
you know, minus 44 or
something without it expanding.

6192
04:10:10,556 --> 04:10:11,389
And you know,

6193
04:10:11,388 --> 04:10:13,975
cryonics will be solved and
you'll be able to like just,

6194
04:10:13,976 --> 04:10:18,427
you know, put a pause in
so to speak, and you know,

6195
04:10:18,427 --> 04:10:22,520
kind of reappear a hundred
years later or something.

6196
04:10:22,520 --> 04:10:25,759
And the thing though that I've
kind of increasingly realized

6197
04:10:25,759 --> 04:10:28,281
is that in a sense, this,

6198
04:10:28,281 --> 04:10:31,005
this whole question of kind of the,

6199
04:10:31,004 --> 04:10:34,842
the sort of one is embedded
in a certain moment, in,

6200
04:10:34,843 --> 04:10:38,960
in time and, you know, kind of
the things we care about now,

6201
04:10:38,959 --> 04:10:42,125
the things I care about now,
for example, had I lived,

6202
04:10:42,126 --> 04:10:44,765
you know, 500 years ago,

6203
04:10:44,765 --> 04:10:46,820
many of the things I care
about now, it's like,

6204
04:10:46,820 --> 04:10:48,510
that's totally bizarre.

6205
04:10:48,510 --> 04:10:50,167
I mean, it's, nobody
would care about that.

6206
04:10:50,167 --> 04:10:52,863
It's not even a thing one
thinks about in the future,

6207
04:10:52,863 --> 04:10:55,929
the things that most
people will think about.

6208
04:10:55,929 --> 04:10:56,762
You know,

6209
04:10:56,762 --> 04:11:01,185
one will be a strange relic
of thinking about, you know,

6210
04:11:01,184 --> 04:11:03,090
the kind of, you know,

6211
04:11:03,090 --> 04:11:06,127
it might be one might have been
a theologian thinking about,

6212
04:11:06,127 --> 04:11:06,960
you know,

6213
04:11:06,959 --> 04:11:08,913
how many angels fit on the
head of a pin or something.

6214
04:11:08,914 --> 04:11:10,605
And that might have been the, you know,

6215
04:11:10,605 --> 04:11:13,869
the big intellectual thing.
So I think it's a, it's a,

6216
04:11:13,870 --> 04:11:16,364
but yeah, it's a, it's a, you know,

6217
04:11:16,363 --> 04:11:19,783
it's one of these things
where particularly, you know,

6218
04:11:19,783 --> 04:11:22,832
I've had the, I don't
know, good or bad fortune.

6219
04:11:22,832 --> 04:11:25,747
I'm not sure. I think it's a,
it's a mixed thing that I've,

6220
04:11:25,746 --> 04:11:28,028
you know, I've invented a bunch of things,

6221
04:11:28,028 --> 04:11:30,237
which I kind of can,

6222
04:11:30,236 --> 04:11:34,784
I think see well enough what's
gonna happen that, you know,

6223
04:11:34,784 --> 04:11:37,121
in 50 years, a hundred years, whatever,

6224
04:11:37,121 --> 04:11:40,963
assuming the world doesn't
exterminate itself, so to speak,

6225
04:11:40,963 --> 04:11:41,797
you know,

6226
04:11:41,797 --> 04:11:46,004
these are things that will be
sort of centrally important

6227
04:11:46,004 --> 04:11:47,501
to what's going on.

6228
04:11:47,501 --> 04:11:49,351
And it's kind of both,

6229
04:11:49,351 --> 04:11:51,059
it's both a good thing and a bad thing

6230
04:11:51,058 --> 04:11:52,957
in terms of the passage of one's life.

6231
04:11:52,958 --> 04:11:53,939
I mean, it's kind of like,

6232
04:11:53,939 --> 04:11:56,147
if everything I'd figured
out was like, okay,

6233
04:11:56,147 --> 04:11:59,004
I figured it out when I was 25
years old and everybody says

6234
04:11:59,004 --> 04:12:02,414
it's great and we're
done. And it's like, okay,

6235
04:12:02,414 --> 04:12:04,882
but I'm gonna live another how many years?

6236
04:12:04,881 --> 04:12:08,243
And that's kind of, it's all
downhill from there in a sense.

6237
04:12:08,243 --> 04:12:12,577
It's, it's better in some sense
to, to be able to, you know,

6238
04:12:12,577 --> 04:12:13,944
there's, there's, it,

6239
04:12:13,944 --> 04:12:16,931
it sort of keeps things
interesting that, you know,

6240
04:12:16,931 --> 04:12:19,343
why I can see, you know,
a lot of these things.

6241
04:12:19,343 --> 04:12:22,058
I mean, it's kind of, I I
didn't expect, you know,

6242
04:12:22,058 --> 04:12:24,469
ChatGPT, I didn't expect the kind of,

6243
04:12:24,468 --> 04:12:28,284
the sort of opening up of
this idea of computational and

6244
04:12:28,284 --> 04:12:31,679
computational language that's
been made possible by this.

6245
04:12:31,679 --> 04:12:34,284
I didn't expect that this is,
this is ahead of schedule,

6246
04:12:34,284 --> 04:12:36,096
so to speak.

6247
04:12:36,096 --> 04:12:38,264
You know, even though the sort of the,

6248
04:12:38,264 --> 04:12:41,102
the big kind of flowering of
that stuff I'd sort of been

6249
04:12:41,102 --> 04:12:43,270
assuming was another 50 years away.

6250
04:12:43,271 --> 04:12:45,565
So if it turns out it's a lot less time,

6251
04:12:45,565 --> 04:12:47,605
that's pretty cool because, you know,

6252
04:12:47,605 --> 04:12:50,479
I'll hopefully get to see it, so to speak,

6253
04:12:50,479 --> 04:12:51,979
rather than, than-

6254
04:12:53,009 --> 04:12:55,049
- Well, I, I think I speak for a very,

6255
04:12:55,049 --> 04:12:59,446
very large number of people
in saying that I hope you

6256
04:12:59,445 --> 04:13:02,075
stick around for a long time to come.

6257
04:13:02,075 --> 04:13:04,134
You've had so many interesting ideas.

6258
04:13:04,134 --> 04:13:07,522
You've created so many interesting
systems over the years,

6259
04:13:07,522 --> 04:13:11,105
and I can see now that
GPT and language models

6260
04:13:11,104 --> 04:13:12,729
broke open the world even more.

6261
04:13:12,729 --> 04:13:15,439
I can't wait to see you
at the forefront of this

6262
04:13:15,440 --> 04:13:18,261
development, what you, what you do.

6263
04:13:18,261 --> 04:13:20,636
And yeah, I've been a fan of yours.

6264
04:13:20,636 --> 04:13:21,897
Like I've told you many,

6265
04:13:21,897 --> 04:13:23,792
many times since the very beginning.

6266
04:13:23,791 --> 04:13:26,264
I'm deeply grateful that you
wrote a new kind of science,

6267
04:13:26,264 --> 04:13:29,626
that you explored this
mystery of cellular automata

6268
04:13:29,626 --> 04:13:33,816
and inspired this one little kid in me to,

6269
04:13:33,816 --> 04:13:35,899
to pursue artificial intelligence

6270
04:13:35,898 --> 04:13:37,537
in all this beautiful world.

6271
04:13:37,538 --> 04:13:39,554
So Stephen, thank you so much.

6272
04:13:39,554 --> 04:13:41,006
It's a huge honor to talk to you, to,

6273
04:13:41,006 --> 04:13:44,054
to just be able to pick your
mind and to explore all these

6274
04:13:44,054 --> 04:13:45,253
ideas with you.

6275
04:13:45,253 --> 04:13:47,823
And please keep going and I
can't wait to see what you come

6276
04:13:47,823 --> 04:13:48,720
up with next.

6277
04:13:48,719 --> 04:13:50,520
And thank you for talking today.

6278
04:13:50,521 --> 04:13:51,364
- Thanks.

6279
04:13:51,363 --> 04:13:52,515
- We went past midnight.

6280
04:13:52,515 --> 04:13:55,023
We only did four and a half hours.

6281
04:13:55,023 --> 04:13:57,315
I mean, we could probably
go for four more,

6282
04:13:57,316 --> 04:13:59,249
but we'll save that till next time to,

6283
04:13:59,248 --> 04:14:01,756
this is around number
four and we'll, I'm sure.

6284
04:14:01,756 --> 04:14:04,143
Talk me more times. Thank you so much.

6285
04:14:04,143 --> 04:14:06,050
- My pleasure.

6286
04:14:06,050 --> 04:14:06,884
- Thanks for listening
to this conversation

6287
04:14:06,884 --> 04:14:08,337
with Steven Wolfram.

6288
04:14:08,337 --> 04:14:10,010

04:14:12,025 --> 04:14:15,899
And now let me leave you some
words from George Cantor,

6291
04:14:15,899 --> 04:14:19,816
the essence of mathematics
lies in its freedom.

6292
04:14:20,747 --> 04:14:25,247
Thank you for listening and
hope to see you next time.
