What comes to mind when you think of Türkiye tourist attraction Ottoman Empire Turkey or Salt Bae Let me tell you this the strangest thing about Türkiye is their economy In 2022 Türkiye's inflation rate suddenly began to soar above 80% Value of Turkish lira dropped by half in a year Sounds very bad But in 2022 Their GDP growth was at 5.6% The entire stock market increased by three folds Moreover, their President has been dissing on interest rate non-stop saying interest rate is evil We need to believe in one true God A big country of 85 million people Its GDP ranks among the world's top 20 Going against mainstream economics Trump even said he will destroy Türkiye’s economy but he is unequivocal and put on tough stand What are all this about？ Let’s get into it with Lin and discover the eccentricity of Turkish Economy Let's start with a very quick background on the Turkish economy In the early days Türkiye had been relatively closed they were just doing their own thing However after WWII Looking at Europe in the north, huddled together for warmth The development was in full swing Turkey wanted to join too and had applied many times to join the predecessor of EU They even opened their country wide to allow western capitalists to invest in Türkiye but they opened up too fast too wide ended up owing huge amount of debt The only solution then was to keep printing money and exchange it into USD to pay off the debt Moreover in the 80s the two oil crises had kept inflation high in Türkiye It had reached more than 120% several times With just few short sentences we’ve already pointed to two main problems in Turkish economy external debt and inflation The Turkish government realised that NO we can’t go down like this else the gap between us and the EU will grow wider So from 1999 Türkiye firmly caried out a series of reforms One of the most important task was to completely separate central bank from the government This is of absolute important in contemporary economy bodies This is because the power of central bank is too big where they could print money and control interest rate Imagine if the government make all the decisions It could lead to the bank becoming government’s personal money printing machine Even if the government is very determined but the market was still worried so they wouldn’t dare to invest or trade The Turkish government had to no matter what separate from the central bank Once become independent if the government were to issue debt it has to follow the supply and demand of the market. If the market feels that your default risk or future inflation expectations are high the price of government bonds will be lowered This invisibly put great pressure on the government The government has to control national finance as well as inflation For the next few years, the Turkish government started to cut expenditures and pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio down to 30% You have to know that it is considered to be healthy if the ratio is below 50% Let’s not look at the crazy ones like USA and Japan Even the very restrained German government has almost never gone down below 60% So you can imagine this 30% is very impressive for Türkiye They also liberalized financial controls let the lira float to adjust to supply and demand To curb high inflation they even increase the interest rate to 100% Türkiye completely changed turned over new leaf and trying to be a better nation So what’s the result? It crashed The Turkish lira has lost more than half its value in eight months This was not that bad This is only a brief period of pain after the exchange rate liberalization Turkish Lira did crash for awhile but managed to be controlled Inflation was being pressed down very rapidly That's 100% interest rate It’s not just inflation anything that would inflate will be pressed down Before this Turkish Lira depreciated too much had to spend thousands of lira just for a meal it had disrupted normal operation of the economy Therefore in 2005 Türkiye introduced a new lira New Turkish Lira A meal that cost a million lira before now is just about 10 lira With the new currency it marks that Türkiye had manage to transform itself completely and ready for the new spring A large influx of external investment boosted the Turkish economy From 2001 until 2016 except slightly impacted during the financial crisis period the GDP growth was kept at 5% to 12% With the inflation being pressed down so low Turkey's heavy industry, textile industry agriculture, etc. are all rising rapidly Exports have increased sixfold in eight years Tourism has grown even more In 2019, it became the sixth most visited country in the world It brings more than $30 billion in revenue to Türkiye every year However behind the Turkish spring there are two major problems One is account deficit or trade deficit Imports consistently outnumber exports Meaning the goods that you buy is consistently more than the goods that you sell Türkiye is already one of the countries that’s with the most deficit in the world So you have to keep spending money right and you need USD or Euro to import now the problem comes Where would Türkiye get so much USD or Euro to support trade deficit?


This happened to lead to the second problem external debt We mentioned earlier that As government debt continues to fall private debt continues to rise in contrast to government debt Actually the increase in personal loans is not a bad thing It is what modern economies would like to see Because borrowing money means your investment needs and consumption needs is robust But Türkiye is borrowing from external source that is Euro, GBP, USD it’s not lira In other word, you can’t print the money At that time Türkiye wanted to join EU so they opened up their country It was very easy for their citizens to get foreign loan For Turkish entrepreneurs inflation and interest rate is very low for Euro and USD so they were very inclined to take up foreign loan By 2019 within Turkish citizens’ savings 50% of them is in foreign currency Can you imagine that for half of the country, the money saved is not in lira A new noun created for this Dollarization the word Dollar in here refers to all foreign currency The problem is easy to understand It’s not a very bad thing for the citizens of a country to get foreign loan extensively but when they couldn’t pay that’s where the trouble comes that affect the country The trouble came in 2014 Türkiye had a new president key figures in Türkiye his name is Recep Tayyip Erdogan Actually from 2003 he was already the Prime Minister The prosperity of Türkiye has a lot to do with him so he was very popular back then Once he became President he took Türkiye on a very eccentric path very eccentric path Although before Türkiye was growing very fast and very well but because of its severe trade deficit the market was worried about dollar shortage similar to last year’s Sri Lanka causing Turkish lira to fall Later Türkiye bought a few fighter jets from Russia Türkiye is a NATO member the act of buying fighter jets from Russia pissed off USA Trump started attacking him and said if you don’t control yourself I’ll destroy Turkish economy I’m not embellishing the story this comes from his Twitter He also imposed punitive tariffs on Turkish raw materials Erdogan is ruthless yet talkative and he isn’t scared of Trump He even go around the country to give speech passionately Just ignore the USA,  they have dollars We have the people We have God We have Allah Sounds inspiring right regardless, market was freaked out They were already worried of the dollar shortage in Türkiye and now the fight with USA Due to this situation international capital all fled away From 2018 till 2019 nearly half of foreign capital withdrew from the market Turkish Lira almost collapse Don’t forget we mentioned earlier that Turkish citizens borrowed a lot of foreign loan if foreign capital withdraw overnight then the capital chain for both personal and companies might be broken With the rapid depreciation of the lira The inflation that has been gone for almost 10 years in Turkey is making a comeback In the face of crisis, the Turkish central bank did a standard procedure very decisively and that is increase interest rate Higher interest rates can curb inflation drag down the local exchange rate This is a good thing I’ve talked about this extensively in the inflation episode With this, the inflation in Türkiye managed to be pressed down However President Erdogan came out and said no we should not increase interest rate we should decrease it interest rate is mother and father all evils mother and father of all evils What economists say in other countries around the world is bullshit and wrong Only by cutting interest rates can curb inflation You must be wondering what is he thinking If he wasn’t crazy We’ll analyse this later Anyhow, Erdogan forcefully urged the central bank to cut interest rates The governor of central bank is an economist after all Mr President this is ridiculous how can we cut interest rate during high inflation didn’t you watch Lin’s video? We said earlier that the government separated the central bank from the government Technically they don’t have to listen to Erdogan However Erdogan was well prepared In 2017 he amended the constitution so that he could possess the right to appoint central bankers So are you going to cut the rate? No? Alright Your day as governor is over he removed the governor of the central bank  And replaced with someone who would listen to him  Immediate interest cut Imagine when the market see such a weird President they got even more panic and withdraw from the market Lira dropped again The new governor upon seeing the condition of Lira started to increase the rate again but he was sacked The new governor had to increase the interest rate a few days later and got sacked again Just like this three governors of Turkish Central Bank was sacked in the period of 2 years The new governor is simple you want it cut, then we’ll cut the rates This means that an independent central bank system that was built before was broken by Erdogan Even the former Prime Minister Erdogan's former number two person openly said that Erdogan doesn’t understand economy the people around him also don’t understand economy He is like from another planet See even the criticism sound civilized So now let’s see what exactly is in the mind of President Erdogan Of course I couldn’t possibly now his exact thoughts I could only base it from some of his speeches, interviews or public information to understand He actually has a perfect logic chain Aren't you all going to talk about economics?


Alright Let me tell you my economics By cutting interest rate, we can drive demand and investment growth When demand and investment grow it could drive the increase of commodity If the increase in the supply of a commodity is higher than the increase in demand won't the price drop? This not only could curb inflation and can keep growth Actually what he said you can’t say it’s not making sense It’s just that from past experience the negative impact of low interest rate is often bigger than the positive impact that he mentioned Low interest rates can cause the economy to overheat the effect of increased demand will be more  distinct which will cause higher inflation rate You might be a bit confuse now Let me give you an example it’s not necessarily a good metaphor This is like a car that is moving very fast and you want it to stop people would normally think to pull it but for Erdogan he said no you shouldn’t pull it you should push it because when you push it it’ll move faster and it’ll create a bigger air resistance and friction when these two forces is bigger than the thrust the speed will slow down So if you want it to slow down you shouldn’t pull it, you should push it instead Of course economics is definitely not as absolute as physics Let me make an example so you can feel it After listening to this you must think this man must have no common sense Actually in the economy world that’s how people view him According to Erdogan’s theory you cut the rate when the economy is overheated you also cut the rate to stimulate economy  This is Erdogan’s target No matter how bad the inflation I’m going to lower the interest rate to 0 Then why must he lower the interest rate down to zero? This is because of his religious belief Türkiye is an Islamic nation And the teachings of Islam emphasize that interest rate is bad you shouldn’t use money to make profit That’s why Erdogan said interest rate is the father and mother of all evils Due to this teaching It’s very difficult for the banking industry in Türkiye Whatever they do is not justified properly have to figure out various ways to go around this evil interest rate If you were to buy a house in Türkiye via loan then the bank can’t charge you interest They have to buy this house and sell it to you at a higher price and loan it to you with zero interest or they rent the house to you Well they can adjust the rental Anyway they think of everything they could to get around interest rate From here you can see that the Turkish is very much against interest rate Back to the story Erdogan wanted to cut the interest rate What is the result of his unconventional operation?


Erdogan was unfortunate got caught up with the 2022 energy crisis That has left Türkiye a big energy importer reeling You see This is the inflation rate of Türkiye in half year from 20% surge up to 80% And this is official data According to private estimation this number should be about 100% to 200% Foreign capital fled in panic again The lira halved in yet another year Turkish citizens if they have money in hand that can be exchanged into foreign currency they did it quickly If they don’t then it’ll be worthless because the deposit interest rate is very low and inflation is high With money on hand, people started to spend it by stocking up goods, buy houses, stocks In 2022 Türkiye's domestic consumption is booming The stock market is the best in the world See every other country has fallen so hard meanwhile Türkiye’s figure is 300% Strong consumption and investment indeed drives very strong GDP in 2021 and 2022 Even if the global economy is weak Even if the energy crisis hits hard In 2022 Türkiye manage to keep growth of 5.6% Consumption is good Stock market is doing well, GDP is growing as well Everything is going well So what Erdogan said was right Interest rate cuts really boost consumption It drives investment and exports These are right but it’s only one façade of the economy If you ask Turkish citizens Few people will tell you they feel richer or feel happier This prosperity can only be counted as False prosperity Actually everyone was in panic spending mode or panic buying stocks mode They spend and invest not because of their confidence in future Although GDP goes up but everyone is anxious This prosperity won’t last long One more thing the richer families and companies in Türkiye could indeed exchange their money to foreign currency or invest their money to avoid inflation But it’s not the case for lower income group They could only watch their money getting less day-by-day The rate of salary increase could not keep up with inflation hike which caused wider gap between rich and poor More than half of Turkish are actually getting paid the lowest salary Look here This is a demographic chart of Turkey Under 45 years old.. abundant of them What an ideal demographic structure for these aging countries to look at With Erdogan making such a kerfuffle Every year, 300,000 young people are lost to other countries That's 300,000 highly educated young people Statistics from a German company show that In Türkiye, 73% of young people want to leave the country This loss of talent and confidence will have a bigger long-term impact on Türkiye In the face of widespread complaints about inflation Erdogan didn’t just sit and do nothing Other than cutting interest rate the overall strategy is actually quite clear He knows that Now Türkiye's biggest problem is capital outflow If he doesn’t take any measures the Turkish citizens are going to exchange their currency then it’ll be bad news Moreover for him personally the most important for him is Presidential election in this coming June 2023 This is related to whether he can continue to be re-elected. So Erdogan did two things The first measure is to prevent capital outflows As an incentive for people to switch back to Lira Other than taking measure like limiting banks' foreign exchange holdings They even came out with a very creative protected foreign exchange deposit model What does it mean? For those holding USD if you exchange USD to Lira Even after the exchange rate you lose money Take the collapse of the lira The bank will pay you back what you lost In other words The bank is taking on the exchange rate risk for you Sounds creative and innovative Erdogan’s second move is bring in foreign capital or draw foreign allies Actually the inflation was so high last year in Türkiye including the constant trade deficit the main reason is because it is huge energy importer Türkiye is quite unlucky the geographical area at north there’s Russia, at south there’s Middle East All producer of fossil fuels But Türkiye doesn’t really have fossil fuels 90% of their energy has to be imported This time Erdogan realised the importance of energy He changed his bold and brazen personality and started to create good relations with these energy powerhouse Although Türkiye is part of NATO but Erdogan is against sanction on Russia He even actively trade with Russia After Russia-Ukraine war the trade between Türkiye and Russia increased compared to before war He even managed to get $9.1 billion to build their own nuclear power plant Apart from that, Erdogan is cuddling up with UAE FYI In 2016, Erdogan went through a very big military coup And the big benefactor behind this coup is UAE So Erdogan and UAE they didn’t get along This time, he forget the past and signed a $4.9 billion currency swap agreement Another is President of Egypt Abdel Fattah al-Sisi Before this Erdogan claimed that he is a murderer that he is barbaric This time taking advantage of World Cup they held hand Apart from that, Türkiye got a loan from their old friend Qatar of about $10 billion They got $5 billion from Saudi In just a year Erdogan has become friends with countries he once despised He also draws in tens of billions of dollars in investment And you see these countries are energy powerhouse They have to rely on these new friends for energy import I can only say there’s no eternal enemy only perpetual benefits In February 6th 2023 Türkiye suffered two consecutive earthquakes with a magnitude of 7.8 At least 45,000 people were killed Turkish government need to spend at least $80 billion to repair the damage This will have a huge impact on public confidence government debt and inflation As for President Erdogan will he be able to curb inflation or will Türkiye become Venezuela or Argentina Will Erdogan be re-elected I do not know Only time will tell
