1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,500
[Music]

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,678
Mark we just tried Orion together yeah

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,798
we're fresh off of it it feels like true

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,679
AR glasses are finally getting closer

5
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:16,600
Orion is a product that you all have

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,800
been working on for five plus years yeah

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,880
almost 10 almost 10 yeah so take me back

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,640
to the beginning when you started the

9
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,038
project when it started in research like

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,199
what were you thinking about what was

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,880
the goal for it well I I think a lot of

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,239
it goes all the way back to

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,200
our relationship with mobile platforms

14
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:38,959
and all that right so it's um you know

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,879
we have lived through one major platform

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,239
transition already because we started on

17
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,439
web right not not on mobile and mobile

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,679
phones and smartphones kind of got

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,439
started around the same time as Facebook

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,759
and and kind of early social media was

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,000
getting started so didn't really get to

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,558
play any role in that platform

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,439
transition but going through it right we

24
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:03,000
weren't born on mobile we kind of

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,000
had this awareness that okay web was a

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,560
thing mobile is a thing it is different

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
um there are strengths and weaknesses of

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,320
it there's this Continuum of computing

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
where now you have a a mobile device

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,639
that you can take with you all the time

31
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,719
and that's amazing MH but it's small

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,000
kind of pulls you away from other

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,679
interactions those things are not great

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,920
but there was sort of this recognition

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,840
that just like there's the transition

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,719
from computers to mobile um mobile is

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,159
not going to be the end of the line so

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,118
as soon as we started

39
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,600
becoming like a more I I guess I'd say

40
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,438
Stable Company like once we found our

41
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,679
footing on mobile and and we weren't

42
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,319
like clearly going to go out of business

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,560
or something like that I was like okay

44
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,000
let's start um

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,359
planting our our some seeds for what we

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,040
think could be the future right it's

47
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:56,959
like mobile is already kind of getting

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,479
defined um you know by 2012 2014 is it

49
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,280
was generally too late to to Really

50
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:03,399
shape that platform in a meaningful way

51
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,478
I we we had some experiments I didn't

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,599
succeed or go anywhere so pretty quickly

53
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:09,038
I was like okay we should focus on the

54
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,479
future because just like there's the

55
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,799
shift from from from desktop to Mobile

56
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:16,759
new things are going to be possible in

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,360
the future so what is that um I think

58
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:21,639
the kind of simplest version of it is

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,160
basically what you started seeing with

60
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:25,679
Orion right it's it's like the vision is

61
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,719
a normal pair of

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,000
glasses that can do two really

63
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:33,039
fundamental things one is

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,159
put Holograms in the world to deliver

65
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,239
this realistic sense of presence like

66
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,400
you there with another person or in

67
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,878
another place or maybe you're physically

68
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,239
with a person but just like we did you

69
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:45,919
can pull up a virtual pong game or you

70
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,280
know whatever um you can work on things

71
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,559
together you can sit at a coffee shop

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
pull up your whole uh workstation of

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,360
different monitors you know you can be

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,319
on a flight or in the backseat of a car

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,720
and pull up a full screen movie theater

76
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,000
and and like okay all these things like

77
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,318
great Computing full sense of presence

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,318
like you're there with people no matter

79
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:09,759
where they are thing

80
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:12,039
two is it's the ideal device for AI and

81
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,759
the reason for that is because glasses

82
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:17,479
are sort of uniquely positioned for you

83
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:20,519
to be able to let them see what you see

84
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,439
and hear what you hear and give you very

85
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,879
subtle feedback back to you where they

86
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,598
can speak in your ear or um or they can

87
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,919
have silent input that that kind of

88
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,238
shows up on the on the glasses that that

89
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,639
other people can't see and doesn't take

90
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,039
you away from the world around you and I

91
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,679
think that that is all going to be

92
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:38,079
really profound now when we got started

93
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,239
with this I had thought that kind of the

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,560
Hologram part of this was going to be

95
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,158
possible before AI um so it's sort of an

96
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
interesting Twist of faith that the AI

97
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,438
part is actually possible before um

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,079
before the Holograms are really able to

99
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:55,840
be mass-produced at a at kind of an

100
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,920
affordable price but um but that was

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,799
sort of the vision I think that it's

102
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,438
pretty easy to wrap your head around and

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,000
there's already you know billion to two

104
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:04,479
billion people who wear glasses on a

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,919
daily basis just like you know everyone

106
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,078
who didn't have smartphones were kind of

107
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,039
the first people to upgrade two

108
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,400
smartphones I think everyone who has

109
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,078
glasses is pretty quickly going to

110
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
upgrade to smart glasses over the next

111
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,319
decade and then I think it's going to

112
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,439
start being really valuable and you know

113
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:18,199
a lot of other people who aren't wearing

114
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,560
glasses today are going to end up

115
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,000
wearing them too um that's kind of the

116
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,360
simple

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,918
version and then I think as we've

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,720
developed this out there are all these

119
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,758
sort of more Nu directions that have

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,919
emerged too so we've started you know

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,919
while while that was kind of the full

122
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,758
version of what we wanted to build there

123
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:41,240
are all these things that we said okay

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,319
well well maybe it's it's really hard to

125
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,400
build normal looking glasses that can do

126
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,879
Holograms um at an affordable price

127
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,198
point so what parts of that can we take

128
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,159
on and that's where we did the

129
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,439
partnership with slor luoda so it's like

130
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
okay before you have a display you can

131
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,240
get normal looking glasses that can have

132
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,000
a camera they can have a microphone

133
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,319
great audio can capture content can um

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,959
um and you can stream video at this

135
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,959
point but the most important feature at

136
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,279
this point is the ability to access meta

137
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:10,399
Ai and just kind of have kind of a full

138
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,319
AI there multimodal because it has has

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,879
camera um and I mean that product is

140
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,759
starting at $300 and you know initially

141
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:19,439
I kind of thought hey this is sort of on

142
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
the technology path to building full

143
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,038
holographic glasses at this point I

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,560
actually just think both are going to

145
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,079
exist longterm right I think that there

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,360
are going to be people who want the full

147
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,240
holographic glasses and I think that

148
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,439
there are going to be people who prefer

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,918
kind of the superior form factor or

150
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:38,560
lower price of a device where they are

151
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,439
primarily optimizing for getting AI um I

152
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
also think there's going to be a range

153
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,600
of things in between right so there's

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
the full kind of field of view that we

155
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,759
that you just saw right 70° really wide

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,120
field of view for glasses um but I think

157
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,560
that there are other products in between

158
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,879
that too there's like a heads up display

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
version which um you know for that you

160
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,279
probably just need you know 20

161
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,038
30° you can't do

162
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,239
kind of the full kind of world Holograms

163
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,519
where you're interacting with things

164
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,120
like you're not going to play ping pong

165
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,598
in in 30 Dee field of view um but you

166
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,439
can communicate with AI um you can text

167
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:16,639
your friends you can get directions um

168
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,719
you can see the content that you're

169
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
capturing um so I there's a lot there

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,400
that's going to be compelling and at

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,879
each step along this Continuum from

172
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,000
display list to small display to kind of

173
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,918
full holographic you're packing more

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,079
technology in so each step up is going

175
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,240
to be a little more expensive um is

176
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,439
going to have a little more constraints

177
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,918
on the form factor even though I think

178
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,360
we'll get them all to be attractive

179
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,120
you'll be able to do the the kind of

180
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,639
simpler ones and much smaller form

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,759
factors permanently um and then of

182
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,400
course there's the mixed reality

183
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,479
headsets which kind of took a different

184
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,560
direction which is going towards the

185
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,879
same vision

186
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,759
but on that we said okay well we're not

187
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,759
going to try to fit into a glasses form

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,680
factor for that one we're going to say

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,960
okay we're going to really go for all

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,079
the compute that we want and we're going

191
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,959
to say okay this is going to be more of

192
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,719
like a heads goggles form factor and my

193
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,079
guess is that that's going to be a thing

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,879
long term too because there are a bunch

195
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,478
of uses where people want the full

196
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,840
immersion um and you know if you're

197
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,038
sitting at your desk and working for a

198
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,239
long period of time you might want the

199
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,279
more computing power than you're going

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,598
to be able to get but but I I I think

201
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,559
that there's no doubt that kind of what

202
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:23,560
you saw with Orion is the I think kind

203
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,399
of quintessential vision of what people

204
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,360
what at least kind of I thought and and

205
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,318
continue to think is going to be the

206
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
next multi billion person major

207
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
Computing platform and then kind of all

208
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,159
these other things are going to get

209
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
built out around it it's my

210
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,919
understanding that you originally hoped

211
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,279
Orion would be a consumer product when

212
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:41,359
you first set out to build it yeah yeah

213
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:44,239
Orion was meant to be our first consumer

214
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,639
product and we weren't sure if we were

215
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,158
going to be able to pull it off I mean

216
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,639
in general it's probably turned out

217
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:52,199
significantly better than our kind of

218
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,800
50/50 estimates of what it would be but

219
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,598
we didn't get there on everything that

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,240
we wanted to I think we we still wanted

221
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,800
to be a little smaller um a little

222
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,319
brighter like a little bit higher

223
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,720
resolution um and a lot more affordable

224
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,240
before we kind of put it out there as a

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,520
product and and look we have line of

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
sight to all those things so I think um

227
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,038
so so I I think we'll we'll probably

228
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,639
have the thing that was going to be the

229
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:18,439
V2 end up being the consumer product and

230
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,918
we're going to use Orion with developers

231
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:21,038
to basically cultivate the software

232
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,240
experience that way by the time we're

233
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,759
ready to ship something it's going to be

234
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,918
much more dialed in but to be clear

235
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,879
you're not selling Orion at all I guess

236
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,240
what I'm wondering is when you made the

237
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,038
call I think it was around 2022 to say

238
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,680
oryan is going to just be internal kind

239
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,000
of dev kit um how did you feel about

240
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,639
making that call was there any part of

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,879
you that was like man I really wish this

242
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,000
could have just been the consumer

243
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:45,360
product we had built I me I always want

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,240
to ship stuff quickly and and all that

245
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,320
um

246
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,639
but I think it was the right thing I

247
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,040
mean I think on this product I think

248
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,399
that there is

249
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,039
a there's a pretty clear set of

250
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,159
constraints that I think you want to hit

251
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,078
MH um especially around the form Factor

252
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,120
right I mean it it is very helpful for

253
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,319
us that sort of chunkier glasses are

254
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,679
kind of ascendant in the fashion world

255
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,839
because that allows us to build glasses

256
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,719
that are going to be fashionable but

257
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,920
also Tech forward but

258
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,759
um even so I'd say you know these are

259
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,519
unmistakably glasses they're reasonably

260
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,838
comfortable they're you know under 100

261
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,320
gram I them for two hours and I couldn't

262
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,839
really tell yeah but but I mean I think

263
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,120
we aspire to building things that like

264
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,240
look really good right and and I think

265
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,240
this is like good glasses but I I I

266
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,519
wanted it to be a little a little

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
smaller so it can fit within like really

268
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,360
fashionable right when people see the

269
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,519
ray bands there's no compromise on

270
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,639
fashion it's like like part of why I

271
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,720
think people like them is yeah you get

272
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,720
all this functionality but even when

273
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,839
you're not using it they're great

274
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,600
glasses and I I think for the future

275
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,480
version of Orion that's the Target too

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,399
we want to make it so that um you know

277
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,920
most of the time you're going through

278
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,159
your day you're not Computing right and

279
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,039
or it's or something is happening in the

280
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,600
background or something but um so it

281
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,599
just needs to be good in order for you

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,360
to kind of want to keep it on your face

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,920
and I I feel like we're almost there I

284
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,079
think we made we've made more progress

285
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,199
than anyone else in the world that I'm

286
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:18,439
aware of um but it didn't quite hit my

287
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,519
bar um and similarly on price um these

288
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,959
are going to be more expensive than the

289
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,519
ray bands right I mean there's just a

290
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,958
lot more Tech that's going in them but

291
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,519
you know we do want to have it be within

292
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,879
a consumer price point and um this was

293
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,639
this was outside that race so I wanted

294
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,320
to wait until we could get to that range

295
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,480
in order to to have something that we sh

296
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,360
are you imagining that the first

297
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,959
commercial version whenever it is in the

298
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,680
next couple few years will it be a

299
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,078
developer focused product that you're

300
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,879
selling publicly you want it to be a

301
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:47,039
consumer ready and that's why I'm asking

302
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,078
about the strategy because Apple snap

303
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,399
others have decided to do developer

304
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,399
Focus plays and get the hardware kind of

305
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,679
going with developers early but you're

306
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,639
kind of are you saying you're skipping

307
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,838
that and you just want cons we are using

308
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,600
this as a developer kit just primarily

309
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,680
inter and maybe with a handful of

310
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Partners but I mean I think at this

311
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:08,239
point meta is by far the kind of Premier

312
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,440
developer of augmented reality and

313
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,639
virtual and mixed reality software and

314
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,000
Hardware in the world so you can think

315
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,600
about it as a developer kit but we just

316
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,720
have a lot of that talent inous and then

317
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,159
we also have well-developed Partnerships

318
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,720
with a lot of folks externally who we

319
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,439
can go to and work with them as well so

320
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,200
it's um I don't think we need to go

321
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,000
announce a dev kit that like that kind

322
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,320
of arbitrary developers can go buy to

323
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,600
get access to the talent that we need to

324
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,720
go build out the platform I think we're

325
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,680
kind of in a place where we can work

326
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,800
with partners and and do that but that's

327
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,479
absolutely what we're going to do over

328
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,000
the next few years we're going to hone

329
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,800
the experience and figure out what we

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
need to do to to to Really nail it when

331
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,559
it's ready to ship a lot has been

332
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,278
written about how much you're spending

333
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,199
on reality labs and if you I don't you

334
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:50,200
probably can't have an exact number but

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,278
if you were to guesstimate the cost of

336
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,800
just building Orion over the last 10

337
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:58,480
years are we talking five plus billion

338
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,240
more than that um yeah probably probably

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,959
yeah yeah but I mean

340
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,360
overall um for reality labs for a while

341
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,199
a lot of people thought of all of that

342
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,800
budget is going towards virtual and

343
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,519
mixed reality and I actually think we've

344
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:16,519
said publicly that our glasses programs

345
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,120
are are a bigger budget than our virtual

346
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,799
and mixed reality programs um but that

347
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,240
goes across all of them right so that's

348
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,759
the kind of full AR that's um the

349
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,639
displaylist glasses like all the work

350
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,919
we're going to do on on um on rayan and

351
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,759
we just announced the expanded

352
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,278
partnership with luoda luoda great

353
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,000
company we've had a great experience

354
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,639
working with them they designed so many

355
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,198
great glasses and I think you know

356
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,079
working with them to to do even more um

357
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:44,399
is is is going to be really exciting so

358
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:45,719
there there's a lot more to do there on

359
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,519
on all of these things how does this

360
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,879
partnership work uh and this renew that

361
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,159
you just did with them how is it

362
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:58,000
structured what is this deal like you

363
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:01,120
know I think it was more of just a kind

364
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,839
of commitment from companies that we're

365
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,560
feeling pretty good about how this is

366
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,800
going and we're going to build a lot

367
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,759
more glasses together and part of the

368
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,639
way it works is um you know rather than

369
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,439
having sort of doing one generation and

370
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,919
then designing the Next Generation I

371
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,920
think by having a longer term

372
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,679
partnership it allows the teams to not

373
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,198
just have to worry about one thing at a

374
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,958
time then like

375
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,958
okay is this one going to be good

376
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,838
and then how do we build on that for the

377
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,838
next one now we can start like a

378
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,040
multi-year road map of many different

379
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,360
devices knowing that we're going to be

380
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,799
working together for a long time so I'm

381
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
optimistic about that that's sort of how

382
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,879
we work internally right we don't just I

383
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,000
mean sometimes when you're early on you

384
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,278
you definitely want to learn from each

385
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,078
device launch but

386
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:49,399
um when there are things that you're

387
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,879
committed to I don't think you want the

388
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,839
team to feel like okay if we don't get

389
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,919
the short-term Milestone then like we're

390
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,360
going to cancel the whole thing right um

391
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,759
so are you buying mistake in elsur

392
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,320
lexotica um yeah I think we've talked

393
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,278
about investing in them it's it's not

394
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
going to be a a kind of major thing I'd

395
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,240
say it's more of a of a symbolic um

396
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,519
thing I me we we we want to have this to

397
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,399
be a long-term partnership and um as as

398
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,198
part of that um I thought that this

399
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,519
would be kind of a nice gesture and I

400
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,838
fundamentally believe in them a lot I

401
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,039
mean I think that they're going to go

402
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,160
from being a the premier glasses company

403
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,639
in the world to I think one of the major

404
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,319
technology companies in the world I me

405
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,360
my vision for for them and how I think

406
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,000
about it is that if you think about like

407
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,199
how Samsung in in Korea kind of um made

408
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,958
it so that Samsung that Korea became one

409
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,679
of the main hubs of building phones in

410
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,599
the world I mean I think that this is

411
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,159
probably kind of one of the best shots

412
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,360
for Europe and Italy in particular to

413
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,559
become a major hub for manufacturing and

414
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,680
building and designing the next major

415
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,958
category of of smart glasses and sorry

416
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,958
of computing platforms overall so um

417
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:03,638
and and I think that they're they're

418
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:06,719
kind of all in on that now and and it's

419
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,839
been this interesting question um

420
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,240
because you know they have they have

421
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,160
such a good business and such deep

422
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,120
competence in in the areas and I I've

423
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,719
gotten more of an appreciation of how

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,639
strong of a technology they company they

425
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,959
are in their own way right designing

426
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,519
lenses designing the materials that you

427
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:26,078
need to make um fashionable glasses that

428
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,198
can be light enough but um but also kind

429
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:33,239
of like feel good um they have they

430
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:35,439
bring a huge amount that I think is um

431
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,680
people in kind of our world the tech

432
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,880
World probably don't necessarily see but

433
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,479
but I think that they're really well set

434
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,759
up for the future so I I I believe in

435
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,278
the partnership I'm really excited about

436
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,600
the work that we're doing together and

437
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,078
fundamentally I think that that's just

438
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,399
going to be a massively successful

439
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,000
company in the future um is is it set up

440
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,480
to where they control the designs or and

441
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,318
you provide the tech stack or do you

442
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,240
collaborate on the design like I I think

443
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,039
we collaborate on on everything it's

444
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,759
it's actually I mean part of working

445
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,360
together is

446
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,278
um you kind of build a joint culture

447
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,079
over time and there were a lot of really

448
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:11,318
sharp people over there who I think it

449
00:16:09,078 --> 00:16:13,239
took maybe a couple versions for us

450
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:16,159
really to gain an appreciation for how

451
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,360
we each of us approach things because um

452
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,078
you know they really think about things

453
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,800
from this like fashion manufacturing

454
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,559
lens selling optical devices perspective

455
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:28,919
um and we obviously come at it from uh

456
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:31,559
kind of consumer electronics AI umof

457
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:33,078
software perspective but I think over

458
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,679
time we just kind of appreciate each

459
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:37,359
other's perspectives on things a lot

460
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,958
more and I mean I I'm like constantly

461
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,839
talking to them about things to get

462
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,000
their ideas on different things I mean

463
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,399
but you know when Partnerships are

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,440
working well when you reach out to them

465
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,318
to get their opinion on things that are

466
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,639
not actually currently in the scope of

467
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,198
what you're working on together and and

468
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,959
because I I do that frequently with um

469
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,078
with Rocco who runs their wearables and

470
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,638
Franchesco who's their their uh their

471
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,439
CEO it's um and our team does that too

472
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,400
with with like a large part of the

473
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,000
working group over there it's um it's

474
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,519
it's a good crew they're they they kind

475
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,119
of they share good values they're

476
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,199
they're really sharp and like I said I I

477
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,678
believe in them a lot and I think it's

478
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,120
going to be a very successful

479
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,038
partnership and Company yeah how many

480
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,359
Rayband metas have you sold so far I

481
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,679
don't know if we've given a number on

482
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,958
that but I know it's asking yeah it's um

483
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,640
it's going very well uh you know one of

484
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,679
the things I think is interesting is we

485
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,000
we underestimated demand so part of you

486
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,798
know one thing that is very different in

487
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,240
the world of consumer electronics than

488
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:39,359
software is um there are fewer kind of

489
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,759
Supply constraints in software there are

490
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,599
some I mean like some of the stuff that

491
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,919
we're rolling out like voice on meta AI

492
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,000
um we need to meter it as we're rolling

493
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,799
it out because we need to make sure we

494
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,079
have enough inference capacity to to

495
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:51,839
handle it but fundamentally we'll

496
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,399
resolve that um in weeks right but for

497
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,678
manufacturing it's like you make these

498
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,080
concrete decisions like okay are we

499
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,880
setting up four manufacturing lines or

500
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,439
six

501
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,799
and you know each one it was a big

502
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,519
upfront capex investment and you're

503
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,240
basically deciding upfront the velocity

504
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,720
at which you're going to be able to

505
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,480
generate Supply before you know what the

506
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,759
demand is so on this one we

507
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,880
thought that Rayband meta was probably

508
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:22,000
going to

509
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,720
sell three or five times more than the

510
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,798
first version did and we just

511
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,319
dramatically underestimated what the so

512
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:31,519
now we're in this position where it's

513
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,079
actually been somewhat hard for us to

514
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,038
gauge what the real demand is because

515
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,439
they're sold out you can't get them so

516
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,798
if you can't get them like then then how

517
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,679
do you know where where the actual curve

518
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,519
is but but that's um we're basically

519
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,200
getting to the point where that's

520
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,000
resolved now we we kind of adjusted we

521
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,360
made the decision to build more more

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,240
manufacturing lines they took some time

523
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,678
to do it they're online now we're kind

524
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,679
of you know it's it's not just about

525
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,240
being able to make them you need to get

526
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,280
them into all the stores and get the

527
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,279
distribution right we feel like that's

528
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,918
in a pretty good place now so I'd say

529
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,158
over the rest of this year we're going

530
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:03,159
to start getting a real sense of the

531
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,880
demand but while that's going on the

532
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,720
glasses keep getting better because of

533
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,559
overthe a AI updates so the hardware

534
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,360
doesn't necessarily change even though

535
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:13,119
um we keep shipping new frames and new

536
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,519
type of you know they're adding more

537
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,678
Transitions lenses because people want

538
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:19,720
to wear them indoors um and that's an

539
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,840
interesting thing because I mean

540
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,440
people sunglasses are a little more

541
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,879
discretionary so I think a lot more

542
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,480
people early on were thinking hey yeah

543
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll try I'll experiment with this with

544
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,319
sunglasses I'm not going to make these

545
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,279
my primary glasses

546
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,960
um now we're seeing a lot more people

547
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,038
say hey this actually really useful I

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,480
want to be able to wear them inside I

549
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:38,879
want them to be my primary glasses so

550
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,079
whether that's kind of working with them

551
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,640
through the optical Channel or the

552
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:46,079
transitions that's an important part but

553
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,559
the the AI part of this um is also it

554
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,879
just keeps getting better I we talked

555
00:19:47,558 --> 00:19:54,480
about it at um at connect I mean

556
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,720
basically the ability to now you over

557
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,960
the next few months when we roll This

558
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,640
Out real-time translations you're

559
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,120
traveling abroad someone's speaking

560
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,038
Spanish to you you just get it

561
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,479
translated into English in your ear just

562
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,960
roll out to more and more languages over

563
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,360
time I think we're starting with a few

564
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,720
we'll kind of hit more over time um I

565
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,599
tried that well actually I didn't try

566
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,440
real time but I tried looking at a menu

567
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,558
in French and it translated into English

568
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,798
and then I was like at the end I was

569
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,519
like what is Euro and dollar actually

570
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,440
and it did that too and then I'm also

571
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,759
starting to see the Continuum of this to

572
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,120
Orion in the sense of the utility

573
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,879
aspects you could say look at this and

574
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,399
remind me about it at 8:00 p.m. tonight

575
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,280
and then it sinks with

576
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,960
so I guess it's not replacing the phone

577
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,000
but it's augmenting what I would do with

578
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,720
my phone like how are these glasses

579
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,159
going to be more deeply tied to Med AI

580
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
over time um seems like they're getting

581
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:46,039
closer and closer all the time but yeah

582
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,038
well well I think Medi is becoming a

583
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,400
more and more prominent feature of the

584
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,640
glasses right there's more stuff that

585
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,320
you can do so you just mentioned

586
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,559
reminders as another example it's like

587
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,480
now that is just going to work and now

588
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,960
your glasses can remind you of things

589
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,319
and so okay you can look at a phone

590
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,480
number and say call this phone number

591
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,038
and then it calls on the phone you know

592
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,720
just will just add more capabilities

593
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:06,079
over time and some of better are model

594
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,360
updates right so like okay now it has

595
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,720
llama 3.2 but um but some of it is is

596
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,359
kind of software development around it

597
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,120
like reminders you don't get for free

598
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,119
just because we updated the model that's

599
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:18,639
kind we have this big software

600
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,359
development effort and um and and we're

601
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
kind of adding features continuously and

602
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:23,959
developing the ecosystem right so you

603
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,278
get more apps so know Spotify and all

604
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,278
these different things kind of kind of

605
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:30,839
can work more natively so the glasses

606
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:32,480
just more and more useful um which I

607
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:35,158
think is also going to increase demand

608
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,679
over time and how does it interact with

609
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,200
phones I

610
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,320
mean like you said I don't think people

611
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,519
are getting rid of phones anytime soon

612
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:48,158
um the way I kind of think about this is

613
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,679
that when phones became the primary

614
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,600
Computing platform we didn't get rid of

615
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,880
computers we just kind of shifted right

616
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,119
so I I I don't know if you have this

617
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
experience but at some point in the

618
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,399
early 2010s I noticed that I'd be

619
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,079
sitting at my desk in front of my

620
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,240
computer and I'd just pull out my phone

621
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:09,399
to do things yeah and I think what's

622
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,720
going to happen it's not like we're

623
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,798
going to throw away our phones but I

624
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,558
think

625
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,000
slowly

626
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,399
um we're just going to start doing more

627
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,880
things with our glasses and leaving our

628
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,320
phones in our pockets more and it's not

629
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,159
like we're done with our computers and I

630
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:26,558
don't think we're going to be done with

631
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,200
our phones for a while but there's a

632
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,399
pretty clear path where um where you're

633
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,880
just going to use your glasses for more

634
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,240
and more things and over time I the

635
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,720
glasses are also going to be able to be

636
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,759
powered by wrist-based wearables or

637
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,079
other wearables so you're going to wake

638
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,480
up one day 10 years AG from now and

639
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,678
you're not even going to need to bring

640
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,519
your phone with you now you're still

641
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,360
going to have a phone but I I think like

642
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,558
more of the time people are going to

643
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:51,319
leave it in their pocket or leave it in

644
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,879
their bag or eventually even some of the

645
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,119
time leave it in their at home and um I

646
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,840
think there will just be this sort of

647
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:59,639
gradual shift to glasses becoming the

648
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:00,599
main way that we do Computing it's

649
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,960
interesting that we're talking about

650
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,599
this right now because I feel like

651
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,880
phones are becoming kind of boring and

652
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,359
stale you know like I I just was like

653
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,840
looking at the new iPhone and it's

654
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,119
basically the same as the year before

655
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:14,240
people are doing foldables but like it

656
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,639
feels like people have kind of run out

657
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,599
of ideas on phones and that they're kind

658
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,320
of at their natural end State and I

659
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:22,599
wonder you know when you see something

660
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,918
like the rayb bands and how people have

661
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,480
really gravitated to them in a way

662
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,240
that's surprised you guys and I think

663
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,120
surprised all of us but it's also just

664
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,480
like people want to interact with

665
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,278
technology in different ways now and I

666
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,360
think

667
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,038
AI like you said at the beginning like

668
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,918
the way that AI is intersected with this

669
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:41,599
is just kind of like a aha thing for

670
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,120
people that honestly for me I didn't

671
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,119
expect it to click as quickly as it did

672
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:48,079
but like when I got WID listed for the

673
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,000
AI I was like walking around my backyard

674
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,158
and like using it and I was like oh like

675
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,679
I it's obvious now where this is going

676
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
so it feels like we're like I was saying

677
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,400
at the beginning it feels like things

678
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,839
are finally you can see where it's going

679
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,400
whereas Before It's been a lot of like

680
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,959
R&D and talking about it but like these

681
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,400
the ray bands are kind of a signifier of

682
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,360
that and I'm wondering if you agree with

683
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,600
that I agree I mean I still think it's

684
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,639
early um I think you really want to be

685
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,480
able

686
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,960
to not just ask the AI

687
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,159
questions but ask it to do things yeah

688
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,840
and know that it's going to reliably go

689
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,840
do it and we're starting with simple

690
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,199
things right so voice control of your

691
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,398
glasses although you can do that on

692
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,440
phones too things like ERS although you

693
00:24:29,398 --> 00:24:35,038
can generally do that on on phones too

694
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,720
but I think as the model capabilities

695
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,759
grow over the next couple of generations

696
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,919
and you get more of you know what people

697
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,720
call these agentic um capabilities I

698
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,038
think it's it's going to start to get

699
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,440
pretty exciting for what it's worth I I

700
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:50,240
I also think that all the AI work is

701
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,720
going to make phones a lot more exciting

702
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,720
um it's the most exciting thing I think

703
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,960
that has happened to our family of apps

704
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,399
road map in a long time is all of the

705
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,000
all the AI things that we're building so

706
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,479
um you know if I were trying to design

707
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,720
what you know the next few versions of

708
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,599
iPhone or Google's phone should be I

709
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,919
mean I I think that there's a long and

710
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:12,719
interesting road map of things that they

711
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,360
can go do with AI that um as an app

712
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,079
developer we can't so um so I think that

713
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,319
that's like a pretty exciting and and

714
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,839
interesting thing for them to go do

715
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,200
which I I assume that they will on the

716
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,839
AI uh social media piece one of the

717
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,278
Wilder things that your team told me you

718
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,879
guys are going to start doing is showing

719
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:30,558
people AI generated imagery personalized

720
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,399
to them in feed I think it's starting as

721
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,879
an experiment but like if you're a

722
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:37,158
photographer you would see Meta AI

723
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,360
generating content that's maybe

724
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,960
personalized for you alongside content

725
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:43,278
from the people you follow yeah and

726
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,840
that's this idea that I've been thinking

727
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,159
about of AI and kind of invading social

728
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,519
media so to speak um maybe you don't

729
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,120
like the word invading but you know what

730
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:55,398
I mean and what does that what does that

731
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,839
do to how we how we relate to each other

732
00:25:55,398 --> 00:26:00,079
as humans like how much AI stuff and AI

733
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,199
Genera stuff is going to be filling

734
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:05,839
feeds in the near future uh in your

735
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,720
view well here's how I Comm at this so

736
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,558
in the history of running the company

737
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,960
where we've been building these apps for

738
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:16,639
20 years every call it 3 to five years

739
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,200
there's some new major format that comes

740
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,360
along

741
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,880
that is typically additive to the

742
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:25,038
experience right so you know initially

743
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,600
people kind of updated their profiles

744
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,158
then they were able to post statuses

745
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:33,119
that were texts then then links

746
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:36,159
um you got photos early on um then you

747
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:38,839
added videos um then with

748
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,480
mobile basically you know snap invented

749
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:42,798
stories the first version of that and

750
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,200
that became a a pretty kind of widely

751
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,200
used format

752
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,038
um the whole version of short form

753
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,759
videos I think is is sort of a still

754
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:58,839
ascendant format but you basically

755
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,480
um at each step along the way

756
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,759
you want

757
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,000
to right it's like you keep on making

758
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,599
the system richer by having more

759
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,480
different types of content that people

760
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:11,439
can um can share and and different ways

761
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,839
to express themselves and when you look

762
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,558
out for the next 10 years of okay if

763
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:18,959
this trend seems to happen where every 3

764
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,678
five years whatever the pace is that

765
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
there are new

766
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,880
formats I think given the pace of change

767
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:28,278
in the tech industry I think you'd bet

768
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,840
that that continues or accelerates and I

769
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:33,278
think you'd bet that probably most of

770
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:35,158
the new formats are going to be kind of

771
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,798
AI connected in some way given that

772
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,760
that's the kind of driving theme for the

773
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,359
industry at this point so given that

774
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,960
kind of set of assumptions

775
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,558
um we're sort of trying to understand

776
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,079
what are the things that are most useful

777
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:52,839
to people within that um there's one

778
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:55,720
vein of this which is helping people and

779
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,720
creators make better content using AI

780
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,120
right so that's um that I think is going

781
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,079
to be pretty clear right just make it

782
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:05,239
like super easy for like aspiring

783
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,359
creators or Advanced creators to make

784
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,759
much better stuff than they would be

785
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:11,278
able to otherwise

786
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:15,440
um that can take the format of like all

787
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,558
right like my daughter is writing a book

788
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
and she wants it Illustrated and like we

789
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:22,200
sit down together and work with meta Ai

790
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,399
and imagine to help her come up with

791
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,558
images to illustrate it um it's like

792
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:27,038
okay that's like a thing that's like she

793
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,599
didn't have the capability to do that

794
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,599
before she's not a graphic designer but

795
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,678
now she kind of has that that that that

796
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,719
ability I think that that's going to be

797
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,399
pretty cool

798
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,839
um then I think that there's a version

799
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:42,599
where you have just this great

800
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,519
diversity of AI agents that are as part

801
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,278
of the system and this I think is a big

802
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,200
difference between our vision of AI and

803
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,079
most of the other companies is yeah

804
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,880
we're building meta AI as as kind of the

805
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,839
main assistant that you can build that's

806
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,519
sort of equivalent to you know the

807
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,319
singular assistant that maybe like a

808
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,720
Google or an open AI or different folks

809
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,079
are building

810
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,360
but it's not really the main thing that

811
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:05,599
we're doing um you know our main vision

812
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,918
is that we think that there are going to

813
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,398
be a lot of these right it's every

814
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,960
business all the hundreds of millions of

815
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,719
small businesses um you know just like

816
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,319
they have a website and an email address

817
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,558
and a social media account today I think

818
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:19,599
that they're all going to have an AI

819
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,158
that helps them interact with their

820
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,558
customers in the future that does some

821
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,600
combination of sales and customer

822
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,519
support and all that um I think all the

823
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:29,079
creators are basically going to want

824
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,759
some version of this that basically

825
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:32,199
helps them interact with their Community

826
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:33,759
when they're just limited by they don't

827
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,200
have enough hours in the day to interact

828
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,519
with all the messages that are coming in

829
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,399
and um they want to make sure that they

830
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,319
can show some love to to people in their

831
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:44,278
in their Community um and those I think

832
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,879
are just the two most obvious ones that

833
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,798
even if we just did those that's many

834
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,600
hundreds of millions but then there's

835
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:51,639
going to be all this more creative stuff

836
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,558
that's ugc that people create for that

837
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,399
are kind of Wilder use cases that they

838
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,879
want and our view is okay these are all

839
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:58,599
going to like live across these social

840
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,320
networks and Beyond

841
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:03,398
and

842
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,798
um I I don't think that they should just

843
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:08,000
be constrained to waiting until someone

844
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:09,798
messages them right I think that they're

845
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,319
going to have their own profiles they're

846
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,879
going to be creating content people will

847
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:15,839
be able to follow them if they want um

848
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,120
you'll be able to comment on their stuff

849
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,319
um they may be able to comment on your

850
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,119
stuff if you're connected with them I

851
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,319
there will obviously be different

852
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,639
different logic and rules but that

853
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,038
that's one way that there's going to be

854
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,480
just a lot more kind of AI participants

855
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,679
in the kind of broader social construct

856
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,159
that we have and then I think you get to

857
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,679
the test that you mentioned which is

858
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,120
maybe the most abstract which is just

859
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:44,480
having kind of the central meta AI

860
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:45,759
system directly generate content for you

861
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,599
based on what we think is going to be

862
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:50,919
interesting to you and putting that in

863
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,158
your feed and on that you know I think

864
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:54,320
that there's this been there's been this

865
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,159
trend over time where the feeds started

866
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,798
off as primarily and exclusively

867
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,080
content from people you you followed

868
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:05,440
friends um I guess it was friends early

869
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:07,199
on then it kind of broadened out to okay

870
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,240
you followed a set of friends and

871
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,639
creators and then it got to a point

872
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,159
where the algorithm was good enough

873
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:14,319
where we're actually showing you a lot

874
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,080
of stuff that you're not following

875
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,038
directly because um in some ways that's

876
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,480
a better way to show you more

877
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:20,638
interesting stuff than only constraining

878
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,038
it to things that you've chosen to

879
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,479
follow

880
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:25,798
and I think the next logical jump on

881
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,720
that is like okay we're showing you

882
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:29,519
content from your friends and creators

883
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,919
that you're following and creators that

884
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,960
you're not following that are generating

885
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,480
interesting things and you just add on

886
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,240
to that a layer of okay and we're also

887
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,720
going to show you content from um that's

888
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,240
generated by by an AI system that might

889
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,960
be something that you're interested in

890
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,200
now how big do any of these segments get

891
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,519
I think it's really hard to know until

892
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
you build them out over time but it

893
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,880
feels like it is a category in the world

894
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,399
that's going to exist and um how big it

895
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,200
gets is kind of dependent on the

896
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,798
execution and how good it is why do you

897
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,360
think it needs to exist as a new

898
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,879
category I'm still wrestling with why

899
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,398
people want this I get the companionship

900
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
stuff that character Ai and some

901
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,319
startups have already shown there's like

902
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,080
a market for um and you've talked about

903
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:13,359
how Med is already being used for role

904
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:16,000
playing and but the big idea is that AI

905
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,839
has been used to inter intermediate in

906
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,278
feed how humans reach each other and now

907
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,638
all of a sudden AIS are going to be in

908
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,159
feeds with us well I think the main

909
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:27,558
difference and that feels big yeah but

910
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,278
in a lot of ways the big change already

911
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:32,519
happened which is people getting content

912
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:34,038
that they weren't following and the

913
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,880
definition of feeds in social

914
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:38,480
interaction has changed very

915
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,360
fundamentally in the last 10 years now

916
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,200
in Social

917
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:45,439
systems most of the direct interaction

918
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,558
is happening in more private forums in

919
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,080
messaging our groups and this is one of

920
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,720
the reasons I think why we were late

921
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,720
with reals initially to competing with

922
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,278
Tik to is cu we we hadn't made this

923
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,960
mental shift where we kind of felt like

924
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,960
no feed is where you interact with

925
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,600
people actually increasingly feat is

926
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,480
becoming a place where you discover

927
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,638
content that you then take to your

928
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,440
private forums and interact with people

929
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:09,798
there so a lot of the the the way that I

930
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,120
interact with people it's like yeah I'll

931
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:13,918
still have the thing where a friend will

932
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,638
post something and I'll I'll comment on

933
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,000
it and engage directly in feed um again

934
00:33:16,638 --> 00:33:20,158
you know this is additive you're adding

935
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,638
more over time

936
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,278
um but the main way that you engage with

937
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:26,918
reals isn't necessarily that you know

938
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,720
you go into the reals comments and

939
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,440
comment and talk to people you don't

940
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,839
know it's like you see something funny

941
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,880
and you send it to friends in a group

942
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,319
chat right and I I think that that

943
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,440
Paradigm will absolutely continue with

944
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:42,678
AI and all kinds of interesting content

945
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,480
so it is facilitating connections with

946
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,720
people um but I think already we're in

947
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,278
this mode where our connections through

948
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,159
social media are shifting to more

949
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:56,079
private places and the role of Feed in

950
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,320
the ecosystem is more as a you know I

951
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,678
call it a discovery engine content to

952
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,519
kind of um you know of ice breakers or

953
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:04,679
interesting kind of topic starters for

954
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,399
the conversations that you're having um

955
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,880
across this like broader spectrum of

956
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,239
places where you're interacting do you

957
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,079
worry about people interacting with AIS

958
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,439
like this making

959
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,839
people less likely to talk to other

960
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,960
people like it reducing the engagement

961
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:21,440
that we have with humans the sociology

962
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,440
that I've seen on this is that most

963
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,119
people have way fewer friends physically

964
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,960
than they would like to have I think

965
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,039
people cherish the kind of human

966
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,838
connection that they have and the more

967
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:33,440
we can do to make that feel more real

968
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,799
and give you more reasons to connect

969
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,398
whether it's through something funny

970
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,679
that shows up so you can message someone

971
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,358
or a pair of glasses that lets like you

972
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,679
your sister show up as a hologram in

973
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,639
your living room when you you know she

974
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,159
lives across the country and you

975
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,599
wouldn't be able to see her otherwise

976
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,720
like that's always kind of our main

977
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,919
bread and butter and the thing that

978
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,799
we're

979
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:53,440
doing but you know in addition to

980
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,119
that I mean if the you know the average

981
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,119
person I think you know maybe they'd

982
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,838
like to have 10 friends and I mean

983
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,160
there's the stat that it's like it's

984
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,960
sort of sad but I think the the average

985
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,519
American feels like they have fewer than

986
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,679
three like real kind of close friends so

987
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,960
does this take away from that my guess

988
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:15,358
is no I I think that what's going to

989
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,679
happen is it's going to help um give

990
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,480
people more of the support that they

991
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,598
need and give people more kind of

992
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,838
reasons and ability to connect with

993
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,079
either a broader range of people or more

994
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,119
deeply with the people who they care

995
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,039
about how are you feeling about how

996
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,039
threads is doing these days I mean

997
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,400
threads on fire it's great I mean it's I

998
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,679
mean these things it's like there's only

999
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,519
so quickly that something can get to a

1000
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,319
billion people so it's G to you know

1001
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,800
we'll kind of keep on pushing on it over

1002
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,359
I've heard it's still using Instagram a

1003
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,160
lot for growth like I'm guess I'm

1004
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,440
wondering when do you see it getting to

1005
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:49,078
like a I mean of Standalone growth

1006
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,480
driver on its own I mean I think that

1007
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,640
these things all connect to each other

1008
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,318
so I I don't I mean I think threads

1009
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,000
helps Instagram I think Instagram helps

1010
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,719
threads I don't I don't know that we

1011
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
have some strategic goal which is like

1012
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,000
like make it so that threads is

1013
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,119
completely disconnected from Instagram

1014
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,239
or Facebook I actually think we're going

1015
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,680
the other direction it started off just

1016
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,000
connected to Instagram and now we also

1017
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:07,598
connected it so that the content can

1018
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,920
show up now taking a step back I me we

1019
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,079
just talked about how for most people

1020
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,280
they're interacting in more private

1021
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,839
forums if you're a Creator what you want

1022
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,160
to do is have your content show up

1023
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:17,400
everywhere right because you're trying

1024
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,239
to build the biggest community that you

1025
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,079
can in these different places so it's

1026
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:24,159
this huge value um for for people if

1027
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,680
they can generate a real or a video or

1028
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,000
some text based content and now you can

1029
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:32,559
post it in Threads Instagram Facebook um

1030
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,239
and more places over time so um so I

1031
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:37,679
think the direction there is generally

1032
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,679
kind of more flow not less and kind of

1033
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,399
more interoperability and that's that's

1034
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,838
why um I've been I've been kind of

1035
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,800
pushing on that as as a theme over time

1036
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,078
I'm not even sure what x is anymore but

1037
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,760
I think what it used to be and what

1038
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,839
Twitter used to be was a place where you

1039
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,359
went when news was happening I know you

1040
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:55,679
and the company seem to be distancing

1041
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,400
yourself from recommending news but with

1042
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,440
threads it feels like

1043
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,920
that's what people want and people

1044
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,920
thought threads might be but it seems

1045
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,920
like you all are intentionally saying we

1046
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,079
don't want threads to actually be that

1047
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,639
yeah I mean it's interesting there's

1048
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,640
there are different ways to to look at

1049
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:14,559
this um I always looked at Twitter not

1050
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:17,318
as primarily about realtime news but as

1051
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,078
a kind of short form primarily text

1052
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,079
discussion oriented app to me the

1053
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,519
fundamental defining aspect of that

1054
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,079
format is that you don't when you make a

1055
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:28,159
post the comments aren't subordinate to

1056
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:30,800
the Post

1057
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:33,000
the comments are kind of at a pure level

1058
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,280
and that is a very different

1059
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,920
architecture than every other type of of

1060
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,760
um of social network that's out there

1061
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,639
and

1062
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,319
um it's a subtle difference but Within

1063
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,598
These systems these subtle differences

1064
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:47,920
lead to very different emerging

1065
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,160
behaviors so because of that people can

1066
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,720
take they can Fork discussions and it

1067
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,559
makes it a very good discussion oriented

1068
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:55,399
platform now news is one thing that

1069
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:56,838
people like discussing um but it's not

1070
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,960
the only thing and I always looked at

1071
00:37:56,838 --> 00:38:00,920
Twitter and I was like

1072
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,720
hey this is such a wasted opportunity

1073
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,400
like this is clearly a billion person

1074
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,879
app um you know maybe in the modern day

1075
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,720
when you have multiple like many

1076
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,880
billions of people using social apps it

1077
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,799
should be multiple billions of people

1078
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,318
and for whatever reason I mean there was

1079
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,400
there are a lot of things that have been

1080
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:18,119
complicated about Twitter and the

1081
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,000
corporate structure and all that but

1082
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,640
they just weren't quite getting there

1083
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,960
and

1084
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:26,239
eventually you know I kind of thought

1085
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,199
hey I think we can do this I think we

1086
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,959
can get this like build out the

1087
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:33,399
discussion platform in in a way that can

1088
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,119
get to a billion people and be more of a

1089
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,240
ubiquitous social platform that I think

1090
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,720
achieves the um the fullness of what

1091
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,199
what what what it like its full

1092
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:45,078
potential but our version of this is we

1093
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,000
wanted to be a Kinder place right we

1094
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,680
don't want to start with kind of the

1095
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,079
like direct kind of head-to-head combat

1096
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:56,078
of news um and especially politics and

1097
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,318
um you feel like that constrains the

1098
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,440
growth of the product at all I mean I

1099
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:00,519
think I think we'll see we'll run the

1100
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,639
experiment um or that that needs to

1101
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,199
exist in the world cuz I feel like with

1102
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:07,239
x's seeming implosion it's not really

1103
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,799
existing anymore maybe I'm biased to

1104
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,759
someone in the media but I do think I do

1105
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,200
think people want when something big

1106
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,599
happens in the world they want an app

1107
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,118
that they can go to and see everyone

1108
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,000
that they follow talking about it

1109
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,079
immediately yeah

1110
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
well there's not we're not the only

1111
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,640
company I there's there were like a ton

1112
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,920
of different competitors and different

1113
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,078
companies doing things and you know I

1114
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,639
mean I think that there's a talented

1115
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,318
team over at Twitter and and um so so I

1116
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,318
I I I wouldn't write them off um and you

1117
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,358
know then obviously there's all these

1118
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:37,000
other folks and there's a lot of

1119
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,519
startups that are doing stuff so I don't

1120
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,599
feel like

1121
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,358
we have to go with that first I I think

1122
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,160
that like maybe we get there over time

1123
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,920
or maybe we decide that it's enough of a

1124
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,159
zero sum trade or maybe even a negative

1125
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,280
sum trade where like that that use case

1126
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:56,960
should exists somewhere but maybe that

1127
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,400
use case prevents a lot more usage um

1128
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,119
and and kind of a lot more value in

1129
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,440
other places because it makes it a

1130
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,280
somewhat less friendly place and

1131
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,039
um I I don't think we know the answer to

1132
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,280
that yet but I I do think the last 10

1133
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:14,000
years eight years of um of our

1134
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,560
experience has been that the political

1135
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,838
discourse is

1136
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,838
um it's It's Tricky right it's on the

1137
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,039
one hand it's obviously a very important

1138
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,519
thing in society and on the other hand I

1139
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:28,079
don't think it leaves people feeling

1140
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:31,039
good so I'm torn between these two

1141
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,480
values on the one hand I I think like

1142
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,639
people should be able to have this kind

1143
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,199
of open discourse and that's good on the

1144
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,199
other hand I don't want to design a

1145
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,759
product that makes people angry right

1146
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:42,439
it's like I mean is like there's an

1147
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,359
informational lens for looking at this

1148
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,960
and there's kind of a you're designing a

1149
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,199
product and like what's the feel of the

1150
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,720
product right it's like I think anyone

1151
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,639
who's designing a product cares a lot

1152
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,519
about how the thing feels and but you

1153
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,759
Rec you recognize the importance of that

1154
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,559
discussion happening in the world I

1155
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,400
think it's useful and look we don't

1156
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:02,920
block it you know we we just make it so

1157
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,559
that um you know for the content where

1158
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,639
you're following people if you want to

1159
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,440
talk to your friends about it if you

1160
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,239
want to talk to them about it in

1161
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,519
messaging there can be groups about it

1162
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,039
um if you follow people it can show up

1163
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,318
in your feed but we don't go out of our

1164
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,719
way to recommend that content when

1165
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:20,279
you're not following it and I think that

1166
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:22,118
that has been a healthy balance for us

1167
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,160
and for getting our products to

1168
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,838
generally feel the way that we want

1169
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:29,679
um and you know culture changes over

1170
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:32,039
time maybe the stuff will be like a

1171
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,078
little bit less polarized and anger

1172
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:36,519
inducing at some point and maybe it'll

1173
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,440
be possible to have more of that while

1174
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,519
also at the same time having a product

1175
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,079
where we're proud of how it feels but

1176
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,519
until then I think we we just we want to

1177
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,318
we want to design a product that um yeah

1178
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:52,480
people can get the things that they want

1179
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:54,358
but um but you know fundamentally we we

1180
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,240
um I care a lot about how people feel

1181
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:59,000
coming away from the products do you see

1182
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,399
this decision to to downrank political

1183
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,318
content for people that who aren't being

1184
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,240
followed um in feed as a political

1185
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,079
decision I guess because I don't know

1186
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:11,239
you're also at the same time you know

1187
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,680
not really saying much about the

1188
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,838
election this year you're not donating

1189
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:15,838
you've said you kind of want to stay out

1190
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,039
of it now and I see the way the

1191
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,440
company's acting and it reflects your

1192
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:22,800
personal kind of way you're operating

1193
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,559
right now and I'm wondering like how

1194
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,240
much more of it is also about what you

1195
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,559
and the company have gone through and

1196
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:30,118
the political environment and not

1197
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,960
necessarily just what users are telling

1198
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,680
you sure um like is there a through line

1199
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,679
there I I mean I'm sure it's all

1200
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,399
connected I think in this case it wasn't

1201
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,519
a trade-off between those two things

1202
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,079
because this actually was what our

1203
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,039
community was telling us and people were

1204
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,599
saying generally we don't want so much

1205
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,279
politics it it like this isn't you know

1206
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,318
like we don't feel good like like I we

1207
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
want like we we want content to that we

1208
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,880
want more stuff from our friends and

1209
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,639
family we want more stuff from our

1210
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,119
interests

1211
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,318
um so that that was kind of the primary

1212
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,960
driver but I think it's definitely the

1213
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:06,719
case that our corporate experience on

1214
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,800
this um shaped this and there's a big

1215
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,399
difference between something being

1216
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,440
political and being partisan and the

1217
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,280
main thing that I care about is making

1218
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,318
sure that we can be seen as a

1219
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,599
nonpartisan and you know as much as

1220
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,239
something can in the world in 2024 be

1221
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,200
sort of like a trusted institution by as

1222
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:28,639
many people as possible and um I just

1223
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:33,118
think that the partisan politics is so

1224
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,598
tough in the world right now that um

1225
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,119
I've made the decision that I I kind of

1226
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,720
feel like for me and for the company um

1227
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,079
best thing to do is to try to be as

1228
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,838
nonpartisan as possible in in in all of

1229
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,960
this and and kind of be be kind of as as

1230
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,318
neutral and and distance ourselves as

1231
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,800
much as possible and it's not just the

1232
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:51,800
substance I also think the perception

1233
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,318
matters so I think um so that's why you

1234
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,160
maybe you know it doesn't matter on our

1235
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,279
platforms whether I endorse a candidate

1236
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,799
or not but like I don't even I don't

1237
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,599
want to go anywhere near

1238
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,160
um and yeah I mean you could say that's

1239
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:07,359
a political strategy um but I think it's

1240
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,719
um I think for where we are in the world

1241
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,078
today it's very hard almost every

1242
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:15,439
institution has become partisan in some

1243
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:18,920
way and we are just trying to resist

1244
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,440
that and maybe I'm too naive and maybe

1245
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,119
that's impossible but that's we're going

1246
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,800
to try to do that on the acquired

1247
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,079
podcast recently you said that the

1248
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,359
political miscalculation was a 20-year

1249
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,880
mistake and a brand from a brand

1250
00:44:28,358 --> 00:44:32,039
perspective and was going to take

1251
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,079
another 10 or so for you to fully work

1252
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,239
through that cycle yeah what makes you

1253
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:39,640
think it's such a lasting thing because

1254
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,838
you look at like how you personally have

1255
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:41,879
kind of evolved over the last couple

1256
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:43,920
years and I think perception of the

1257
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,440
company has evolved and I'm wondering

1258
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,280
like what you meant by saying it's going

1259
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,200
to take another 10 years I'm just

1260
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,040
talking about where our brand is and our

1261
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:54,838
reputation are compared to where I think

1262
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,239
they would have been I mean there's no

1263
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,159
doubt that even now here and okay yeah

1264
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:00,598
sure maybe things have improved somewhat

1265
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:03,239
over the last few years you can feel the

1266
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:05,800
trend but it's still significantly worse

1267
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:08,838
than it was in 2016 um you know it's I

1268
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:13,318
mean the internet industry overall um

1269
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:17,318
and I think our company in particular um

1270
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:19,519
just were seeing way more positively and

1271
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:21,480
now look there were real issues right so

1272
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:22,559
so I I I I think that it's always very

1273
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,400
difficult to talk about this stuff in a

1274
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,000
nuanced way because

1275
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,639
um I think to some Dee before 2016

1276
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,079
everyone was sort of too Rosy about the

1277
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:32,400
internet overall and didn't talk enough

1278
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,000
about the issues and then the pendulum

1279
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,160
sort of swung and people only talked

1280
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,960
about the issues and didn't talk about

1281
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:40,879
the stuff that was positive and it was

1282
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,240
all both there the whole time um but so

1283
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,039
when I talk about this I don't mean to

1284
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:48,759
you know come across as simplistic or um

1285
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,079
you know you guys didn't do anything

1286
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,359
wrong or anything like or that there

1287
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,640
weren't issues with the Internet or

1288
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:54,400
things like that I mean obviously every

1289
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,759
year you know whether it's politics or

1290
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,039
other things there always things that

1291
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,520
you look back at and you're like hey

1292
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,880
yeah like if I were playing this

1293
00:45:58,519 --> 00:46:02,318
perfectly I would have done these things

1294
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:06,440
differently and

1295
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,759
um but I do think it's the case that I

1296
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,400
didn't really know how to react to

1297
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,720
something as big of of of sort of a

1298
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
shift in the world as what happened and

1299
00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,639
it took me a while to find my footing

1300
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,920
and and I I I do think that It's Tricky

1301
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,759
when you're caught up in these kind of

1302
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,280
big debates and you're not kind of

1303
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,720
experienced or sophisticated and

1304
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,640
engaging with that I think um you can

1305
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:31,239
make some big missteps and I I do think

1306
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:32,920
that some of the things that um that

1307
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,719
that that we were accused of over time

1308
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,280
it just you know I think it's just been

1309
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:37,558
pretty clear at this point you know now

1310
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,519
that all the investigations have been

1311
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,960
done that like they they weren't true um

1312
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,079
and you're talking about like Cambridge

1313
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,519
analytica I think C analytica is a good

1314
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:48,240
example of something that it's like

1315
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:51,159
people thought that like all this data

1316
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:54,679
had been taken and that um it had been

1317
00:46:51,159 --> 00:46:56,199
used in this campaign and out wasn't and

1318
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:58,679
like and yeah so it's like all the stuff

1319
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,159
okay the data wasn't even you know

1320
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:01,519
accessible to the to the developer and

1321
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,399
and we'd fix the issue like five years

1322
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:07,039
ago so um but in the moment it was like

1323
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,838
really hard for us to to kind of have a

1324
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:13,800
rational discussion about that and I

1325
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:15,159
think part of the challenge is that um

1326
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,160
you know for the general population I

1327
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:18,118
think a lot of people they read the

1328
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:22,279
initial headlines and they don't

1329
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:23,960
necessarily read the um you know and and

1330
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,760
and frankly you know a lot of the media

1331
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,920
I don't think was like as loud to write

1332
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,480
about when all the invest concluded that

1333
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,119
said that there weren't um that like a

1334
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,440
lot of the initial allegations were just

1335
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:36,480
completely wrong so I I think that's

1336
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,318
like a that's a real thing so okay so

1337
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,679
you take these hits and I didn't really

1338
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:45,239
know how to how to kind of push back on

1339
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:46,679
that and maybe some of it you can't but

1340
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:48,078
I I like to think that I think we could

1341
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:51,039
have played this some of this stuff

1342
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,039
differently um and I do think it was

1343
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,920
certainly the case that when you take

1344
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,639
responsibility for things that are not

1345
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:01,680
your fault you become sort of a weak

1346
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,719
Target for people who are looking to

1347
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,799
blame other things and find a target for

1348
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,598
them and it's sort of like um this is a

1349
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,800
different part of of of it's it's

1350
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,680
somewhat related to this but when you

1351
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,318
think about like like litigation

1352
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,799
strategy for the company one of the

1353
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:18,279
reason why I hate settling lawsuits is

1354
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,519
that it it basically sends a signal to

1355
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,519
people that hey this is a company that

1356
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,759
settles lawsuits so maybe like we can

1357
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:26,199
sue them and they'll settle lawsuits so

1358
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,720
um so you wouldn't write a blank check

1359
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:29,679
to the government like Google did for

1360
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,598
its antitrust case no I think like I

1361
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:34,639
think the right kind of way to approach

1362
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:36,880
this is when you believe in something

1363
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:39,118
you fight really hard for it and I think

1364
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,318
this is a repeat game this isn't like

1365
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,559
this it's not like there's a single

1366
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,440
issue and we're going to be around for a

1367
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,760
long time and I think it's it's really

1368
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,079
important that people know that we're a

1369
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,839
company that has conviction and that we

1370
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:52,039
we believe in what we're doing and we're

1371
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:53,759
going to back that up and defend

1372
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,920
ourselves and I think that that kind of

1373
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,280
sets the right tone um now now I think

1374
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,000
over the next 10 years I think we're

1375
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,960
sort of digging ourselves back to

1376
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,119
neutral on this and but I I like to

1377
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,400
think that if we hadn't had a lot of

1378
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,318
these issues we would have made progress

1379
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,960
over the last 10 years too so I sort of

1380
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,759
give it this time frame maybe 20 years

1381
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,358
is too long maybe it's 15 but it's hard

1382
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,920
to know with politics it feels like

1383
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:16,798
mental health and youth mental health

1384
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,559
may be the next wave of this that that I

1385
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:20,400
think is the next big fight and and on

1386
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,760
that you know I think a lot of the data

1387
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,519
on this I I think is just not where the

1388
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,359
narrative is the The Narrative yeah I

1389
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:30,480
think the narrative is a lot of people

1390
00:49:26,358 --> 00:49:33,558
sort of take it as um as if it's like an

1391
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,639
assumed thing that there's some link and

1392
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:37,200
like I think the majority of the of the

1393
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,480
high quality research that's out there

1394
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,598
suggests that there's no causal

1395
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,358
connection like a at kind of a broad

1396
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:44,680
scale between between these things so um

1397
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,039
now look I mean I think that that's

1398
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:47,759
different from saying like in any given

1399
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:50,079
issue like was is someone bullied should

1400
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,440
we try to stop bullying yeah of course

1401
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,720
um

1402
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,240
but yeah overall um I I I think that

1403
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,199
this is this is one

1404
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:00,519
where there there are a bunch of these

1405
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,639
cases I think that there will be a lot

1406
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:06,000
of litigation around them uh and it's

1407
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:09,078
one where we're trying to make sure that

1408
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,519
the academic research that that shows

1409
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:14,359
something that that I think is you it um

1410
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:16,358
you know to me it sort of foots more

1411
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,239
with what I've seen of how the platforms

1412
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:20,039
operate but it's counter to what a lot

1413
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,199
of people think and I think that that's

1414
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:24,519
going to be a reckoning that we'll have

1415
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,279
to have is is basically when as the the

1416
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,798
kind of the majority of the highquality

1417
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,798
academic research um kind of gets shown

1418
00:50:29,798 --> 00:50:32,880
is like Okay can people accept this and

1419
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:34,798
I think that's going to be a really

1420
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,000
important um set of debates over the

1421
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,639
next year at the same time you guys have

1422
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,079
acknowledged there's affordances in the

1423
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:40,920
product like the teen roll out with

1424
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,240
Instagram recently that you can make to

1425
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,880
make the product a better experience for

1426
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:47,519
young people yeah and I think this is an

1427
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,400
interesting part of the balance is

1428
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,679
um you can play a role in trying to make

1429
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,160
something better even if the thing

1430
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:57,039
wasn't caused by you in the first place

1431
00:50:55,159 --> 00:51:00,920
like there's no doubt that being being a

1432
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:04,639
parent is really hard and there's a big

1433
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:08,119
question of in this internet age where

1434
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:11,078
we have phones

1435
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:14,559
um what are the right tools that parents

1436
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:18,079
need in order to be able to raise their

1437
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,798
kids and like I think that we can play a

1438
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,880
role in giving people controls over U

1439
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,199
parental controls over the apps I think

1440
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,400
that parental controls are also really

1441
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:27,039
important because parents have different

1442
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,240
ways that they want to raise their kids

1443
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,039
or just like schooling and education

1444
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:32,639
people have like very significantly

1445
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,679
different local preferences for how they

1446
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,519
want to raise their kids I don't think

1447
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:39,480
that most people want some internet

1448
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,559
company setting all the rules for this

1449
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,000
either so obviously you know when there

1450
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,920
are laws passed we'll we'll kind of

1451
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,920
follow the the the government's

1452
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,200
Direction and and and the laws on that

1453
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,798
but I actually think the right approach

1454
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:55,639
for us is to primarily kind of align

1455
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:57,119
with parents to give them the tools that

1456
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:59,519
they want to be able to raise their kids

1457
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,559
in the way that they want and some

1458
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:02,318
people are going to think that more

1459
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,480
technology use is good that's sort of

1460
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:07,199
how my parents you know Raised Me

1461
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:10,079
growing Up um I think it worked pretty

1462
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:12,078
well um some people are going to be kind

1463
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,079
of more more um you know want to limit

1464
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,119
it more and we want to give them the

1465
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,720
tools to be able to do that but but I

1466
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,119
don't think that this is you know

1467
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:21,519
primarily or only a social media thing

1468
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,960
um even even the parts of this that are

1469
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,880
technology age verification I think

1470
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,318
phones like the phone platforms have a

1471
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,599
huge part of this this I mean it's um

1472
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,079
yeah there's this big question of how do

1473
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,640
you do age verification and I mean I can

1474
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,359
tell you what the easiest way is which

1475
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:36,759
is like all right like every time you go

1476
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,000
do a payment on your phone I mean there

1477
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,520
already is child um you know basically

1478
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,719
like child age verification so I don't

1479
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,000
really understand well I guess I

1480
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:48,399
understand but I think it's it's it's

1481
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,559
not very um you know excusable from my

1482
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,880
perspective why apple and and and um I

1483
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,160
guess to some extent Google don't want

1484
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,760
to just extend the age verification that

1485
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,558
they already have on their phones to be

1486
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:04,559
a parental control for parents to to

1487
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,359
basically be able to say what um you

1488
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,798
what apps can my kids use right it's

1489
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:09,719
hard for me to not see the logic in it

1490
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:11,079
either I don't I don't really I think

1491
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,838
they don't want to take

1492
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:15,119
responsibility but maybe that's on

1493
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:18,199
Congress then to pass who has to take

1494
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,358
responsibility yeah yeah so and and and

1495
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,558
we're going to do our part and we're

1496
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,920
going to we're going to build the tools

1497
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:28,519
that we can for for parents and for and

1498
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:31,119
for teens um but it the end of the day

1499
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,679
um I I and look I'm not saying it's all

1500
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,200
the phone's fault either although I I

1501
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:36,519
would say that like the ability to get

1502
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:38,919
push notifications and get kind of

1503
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,440
distracted is from my perspective seems

1504
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,400
like a much greater contributor to

1505
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,960
mental health issues than um than than

1506
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,039
kind of a lot of the specific apps but

1507
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,599
but there are things that that I think

1508
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:51,639
everyone should should kind of try to

1509
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:54,160
improve and work on um

1510
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:55,879
but yeah I mean I that that's sort of

1511
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,838
that's sort of my view on all that on

1512
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,400
the regul piece as it relates to AI

1513
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:03,639
you've been very vocal about what's

1514
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,599
happening in the EU and uh you recently

1515
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:07,279
signed an open letter and I believe it

1516
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,720
was saying basically that you guys just

1517
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,040
don't have Clarity on consent for

1518
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:15,598
training how it's supposed to work um

1519
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:17,039
and I'm wondering what you think needs

1520
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,440
to happen there for things to move

1521
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,558
forward because like Med AI is not

1522
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:24,639
available in Europe new llama models are

1523
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,160
not um is that something you see getting

1524
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:30,279
resolved uh at all

1525
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:31,679
I guess and what would it take yeah I

1526
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:36,720
don't know it's it's a little hard for

1527
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:38,519
me to parse the the European politics um

1528
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,639
I have a hard time enough with American

1529
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:42,480
politics I mean it's and and I'm I'm

1530
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,239
American but

1531
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,679
um so in theory my understanding of the

1532
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,838
way this is supposed to work is they

1533
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:55,199
they kind of passed this gdpr

1534
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:58,239
regulation and you're supposed to have

1535
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:01,439
this this idea of sort of a One-Stop

1536
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:04,000
shop like home regulator who can

1537
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,720
basically on behalf of the whole EU

1538
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,760
interpret and enforce the rules and we

1539
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:12,879
have our European headquarters and we

1540
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,480
work with that regulator and you know I

1541
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,880
think they're like okay they're pretty

1542
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,159
tough on us and pretty firm but at least

1543
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,960
when you're working with one regulator

1544
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,399
you can kind of understand how are they

1545
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,920
thinking about things and it's and you

1546
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,960
can make progress and the thing that I

1547
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,639
think has been

1548
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,000
tricky is there there have been from

1549
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:31,199
from my perspective a little bit of a

1550
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,798
backslide where now you get all these

1551
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:37,519
other um dpas across the continent sort

1552
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,880
of also intervening and and trying to do

1553
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,038
things and it just seems like more of an

1554
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,280
kind of internal EU political thing

1555
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:45,039
which is like okay do they want to have

1556
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,839
this One-Stop shop and have Clarity for

1557
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,200
companies so companies can act can kind

1558
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,798
of like can execute or or do they just

1559
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:54,960
want it to be this kind of very

1560
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:57,318
complicated regulatory system and um I

1561
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,639
look I think that's for them to out um

1562
00:55:57,318 --> 00:56:00,838
but but I know there's no doubt that

1563
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,159
when you have like dozens of different

1564
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:04,798
Regulators that can ask you kind of the

1565
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,960
same questions about different things it

1566
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,199
makes it a much more difficult

1567
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,199
environment to build things do you do I

1568
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:10,759
don't think that that's just us I think

1569
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,679
that that's all the company but do you

1570
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,839
understand the concern people have about

1571
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:18,078
training data and creators even and this

1572
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,480
idea that their data is being used for

1573
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,359
these models they're not getting

1574
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,318
compensated and the models are creating

1575
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:25,639
a lot of value and I know you're giving

1576
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:26,920
away llama but you're still you've got M

1577
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,759
Ai and

1578
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,519
I understand the frustration that people

1579
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,720
have about that I think it's a naturally

1580
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,199
bad feeling to be like oh my my data is

1581
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,078
now being used in a new way that I have

1582
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,558
no control or compensation over do you

1583
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,119
do you sympathize with that yeah I mean

1584
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:43,400
I think that there in any new medium and

1585
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,280
Technology there's like the concepts

1586
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:49,440
around fair use and like where are the

1587
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,119
boundaries between what you have control

1588
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,838
over right when you put something out in

1589
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,838
the world to what degree do you still

1590
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,038
get to control it and and kind of own it

1591
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:59,599
and license it

1592
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:02,000
um and I I think that all these things

1593
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,920
are basically going to get need to get

1594
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,119
you know relitigated and rediscussed in

1595
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,838
the um in the in the AI era so I'm I get

1596
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,400
it I I I think that these are these are

1597
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,078
important questions I think this is not

1598
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,400
like a completely novel thing to AI in

1599
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,599
in the grand scheme of things I think it

1600
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,000
was you a lot of them there were

1601
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,838
questions about it with with the

1602
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,559
internet overall too and with different

1603
00:57:20,838 --> 00:57:26,358
Technologies over time

1604
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:28,160
um and but I think getting to clarity

1605
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:32,119
that is going to be important so that

1606
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,960
way the things that Society wants people

1607
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,318
to build they can go build what is

1608
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,079
Clarity look like to you there I mean I

1609
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:39,719
think it starts with having some

1610
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,839
framework of like okay what's the

1611
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:43,959
process going to be if we're working

1612
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:45,519
through that but but you don't see a

1613
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,159
scenario where creators get like

1614
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,880
directly compensated for the use of

1615
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,639
their content I think that there's a lot

1616
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,440
of different possibilities for how stuff

1617
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:55,519
goes in the future now I do think that

1618
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,480
there's this issue which is a lot of

1619
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,119
like while psychologically I understand

1620
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:03,838
what you're saying yeah I think

1621
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,680
individual creators or Publishers tend

1622
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,480
to

1623
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:10,598
overestimate the value of their specific

1624
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:12,480
content right so it's like okay maybe

1625
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,200
like in in in like in the grand scheme

1626
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:18,679
of this right so um so we have this set

1627
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,960
of challenges with with um you know news

1628
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:21,879
Publishers around the world which is

1629
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,318
like okay they they're like a lot of

1630
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,760
folks are constantly kind of asking to

1631
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:26,960
be paid for the content and on the other

1632
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,559
hand we have of our community which is

1633
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,639
asking us to show less news because it

1634
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,039
makes them feel bad right and I mean we

1635
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,038
talked about that so it's like there's

1636
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,839
this issue which is okay it's like

1637
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:37,880
actually we're showing some amount of

1638
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:40,159
the news that we're showing because we

1639
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,640
think it's socially important against

1640
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,199
what our community wants like if we were

1641
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:44,879
actually just following our our our what

1642
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,159
our what our community wants we'd show

1643
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,480
even less than we're showing um and you

1644
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:50,118
see that in the data that people just

1645
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,079
don't like to engage with this stuff and

1646
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:54,318
we've had these issues where sometimes

1647
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:56,359
we like Publishers say okay if you're

1648
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,038
not going to pay us then pull our cont

1649
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:59,239
down and it's just like yeah Share Fine

1650
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:01,240
pull pull your content down I mean that

1651
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:04,719
sucks I'd rather people be able to share

1652
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:08,000
it but but if but I think some to some

1653
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:12,038
degree some of these questions have to

1654
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
get tested by their negotiations and

1655
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:17,160
they have to get tested by people

1656
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,639
walking and and like and then at the end

1657
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:23,318
once people walk you figure out where

1658
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,639
the value really is right if if it if it

1659
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:28,639
really is the case that that news was a

1660
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:30,838
big thing the community wanted then I

1661
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:32,920
mean look we're we're a big company we

1662
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:34,119
could you know we we could probably you

1663
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,240
know we pay for Content when it's

1664
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:36,240
valuable to people we're just not going

1665
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:40,038
to pay for Content when it's not

1666
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:42,439
valuable to people um so I think that

1667
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:45,079
you'll probably see a similar Dynamic

1668
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,280
with AI which is my guess is that there

1669
00:59:45,079 --> 00:59:47,839
are going to be certain Partnerships

1670
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,680
that get made when content is really

1671
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:53,798
important and valuable um and i' guess

1672
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,279
that there's probably a lot of people

1673
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:59,239
who are kind of have a a concern about

1674
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,200
like the feel of it like you're saying

1675
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:03,759
but then when push comes to

1676
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,679
shove if like if they demanded that we

1677
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,480
take that we don't use their content

1678
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,118
then we just wouldn't use their content

1679
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,519
and it's not like you know that's going

1680
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,400
to change the outcome of this stuff that

1681
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:14,119
much I guess to bring this full circle

1682
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,599
where we started uh as you're building

1683
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:18,240
augmented reality glasses um and what

1684
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,798
you've learned over just the societal

1685
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,919
implications of the stuff you've built

1686
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:25,000
over the last decade um how are you

1687
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,159
thinking about this as it relates to

1688
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,639
glasses at scale because you're

1689
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,798
literally going to be augmented

1690
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:31,440
augmenting reality which is a it's a

1691
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:33,038
responsibility I think that's going to

1692
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,838
be another platform too and you're going

1693
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,160
to have a lot of these questions as well

1694
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:38,400
I mean I think the interesting thing

1695
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,639
about Holograms and augmented reality is

1696
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,920
it's going to be this intermingling of

1697
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,759
the physical and digital much more than

1698
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,480
we've had in other platforms um where on

1699
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,520
your phone it's like okay yeah we we

1700
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,000
live a primarily physical world but then

1701
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,798
you have the small window into this

1702
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,079
digital world and I think we're going to

1703
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,038
basically have this world in the future

1704
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,160
that is

1705
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,039
increasingly you know call it half

1706
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,679
physical half digital or I don't know

1707
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:06,880
60% physical 40% digital and it's like

1708
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,719
and it's um going to be Blended together

1709
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,519
and I think that there are going to be a

1710
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:14,199
lot of interesting governance questions

1711
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:16,239
around that right in terms of um like is

1712
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:18,558
is kind of all of the digital stuff

1713
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:21,000
that's overlaid physically going to fit

1714
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,400
within sort of a

1715
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,400
physical kind of

1716
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,720
national regulation perspective or is it

1717
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,358
sort of is it actually coming from a

1718
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:32,519
different world or something you know

1719
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:34,838
and and um I think these will all be

1720
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:36,519
very interesting questions that we will

1721
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,759
have a perspective I'm sure we're not

1722
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:40,679
going to be right about every single

1723
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,960
thing um I I think like the world will

1724
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:43,078
kind of need to sort out where it wants

1725
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,280
to be different countries will have

1726
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:45,440
different values and take somewhat

1727
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,359
different approaches on things and I

1728
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,480
think that that's it's part of the

1729
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:51,239
interesting process of this the the

1730
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,039
tapestry of how it all gets built is

1731
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:57,000
like is um you need to work through so

1732
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,079
that it ends up being positive for you

1733
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,920
know as many of the possible

1734
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,440
stakeholders as possible more to come

1735
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,079
yeah a lot to come yeah thanks Mark okay

1736
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,838
